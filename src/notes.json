Scott Fitzgerald\n\n\n\nThen wear the gold hat, if that will move her;\n  If you can bounce high, bounce for her too,\nTill she cry \"Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover,\n  I must have you!\"\n\n                    --THOMAS PARKE D'INVILLIERS\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\n\n\nIn my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice\nthat I've been turning over in my mind ever since.\n\n\"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,\" he told me, \"just\nremember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages\nthat you've had.\"\n\nHe didn't say any more but we've always been unusually communicative\nin a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more\nthan that. In consequence I'm inclined to reserve all judgments,\na habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also\nmade me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind\nis quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it\nappears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I\nwas unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the\nsecret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were\nunsought--frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile\nlevity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate\nrevelation was quivering on the horizon--for the intimate revelations\nof young men or at least the terms in which they express them are\nusually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving\njudgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of\nmissing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested,\nand I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is\nparcelled out unequally at birth.\n\nAnd, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission\nthat it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet\nmarshes but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on.\nWhen I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the\nworld to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I\nwanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the\nhuman heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was\nexempt from my reaction--Gatsby who represented everything for which I\nhave an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of\nsuccessful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some\nheightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related\nto one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten\nthousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that\nflabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the\n\"creative temperament\"--it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic\nreadiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it\nis not likely I shall ever find again. No--Gatsby turned out all right\nat the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the\nwake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the\nabortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.\n\n\nMy family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle-western\ncity for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan and we\nhave a tradition that we're descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the\nactual founder of my line was my grandfather's brother who came here in\nfifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War and started the wholesale\nhardware business that my father carries on today.\n\nI never saw this great-uncle but I'm supposed to look like him--with\nspecial reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in\nFather's office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a\ncentury after my father, and a little later I participated in that\ndelayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the\ncounter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being\nthe warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like the\nragged edge of the universe--so I decided to go east and learn the bond\nbusiness. Everybody I knew was in the bond business so I supposed it\ncould support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it\nover as if they were choosing a prep-school for me and finally said,\n\"Why--ye-es\" with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance\nme for a year and after various delays I came east, permanently, I\nthought, in the spring of twenty-two.\n\nThe practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was a warm\nseason and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees,\nso when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house\ntogether in a commuting town it sounded like a great idea. He found\nthe house, a weather beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but\nat the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went out\nto the country alone. I had a dog, at least I had him for a few days\nuntil he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman who made my bed\nand cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the\nelectric stove.\n\nIt was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently\narrived than I, stopped me on the road.\n\n\"How do you get to West Egg village?\" he asked helplessly.\n\nI told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a\npathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the\nfreedom of the neighborhood.\n\nAnd so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the\ntrees--just as things grow in fast movies--I had that familiar\nconviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.\n\nThere was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health to be\npulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen\nvolumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood\non my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to\nunfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas\nknew. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides.\nI was rather literary in college--one year I wrote a series of very\nsolemn and obvious editorials for the \"Yale News\"--and now I was going\nto bring back all such things into my life and become again that most\nlimited of all specialists, the \"well-rounded man.\" This isn't just an\nepigram--life is much more successfully looked at from a single window,\nafter all.\n\nIt was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of\nthe strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender\nriotous island which extends itself due east of New York and where\nthere are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of\nland. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in\ncontour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most\ndomesticated body of salt water in the Western Hemisphere, the great\nwet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals--like the\negg in the Columbus story they are both crushed flat at the contact\nend--but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual\nconfusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more\narresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except\nshape and size.\n\nI lived at West Egg, the--well, the less fashionable of the two, though\nthis is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little\nsinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the\negg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge\nplaces that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on\nmy right was a colossal affair by any standard--it was a factual\nimitation of some H\u00f4tel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side,\nspanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool\nand more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby's mansion.\nOr rather, as I didn't know Mr. Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by\na gentleman of that name. My own house was an eye-sore, but it was a\nsmall eye-sore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the\nwater, a partial view of my neighbor's lawn, and the consoling\nproximity of millionaires--all for eighty dollars a month.\n\nAcross the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg\nglittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins\non the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom\nBuchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed and I'd known Tom\nin college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in\nChicago.\n\nHer husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of\nthe most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven--a\nnational figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute\nlimited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of\nanti-climax. His family were enormously wealthy--even in college his\nfreedom with money was a matter for reproach--but now he'd left Chicago\nand come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for\ninstance he'd brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest.\nIt was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy\nenough to do that.\n\nWhy they came east I don't know. They had spent a year in France, for no\nparticular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever\npeople played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move,\nsaid Daisy over the telephone, but I didn't believe it--I had no sight\ninto Daisy's heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking\na little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable\nfootball game.\n\nAnd so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East\nEgg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was\neven more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red and white Georgian\nColonial mansion overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach\nand ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over\nsun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens--finally when it reached\nthe house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the\nmomentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows,\nglowing now with reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy\nafternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his\nlegs apart on the front porch.\n\nHe had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy, straw haired\nman of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner.\nTwo shining, arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and\ngave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not\neven the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous\npower of that body--he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he\nstrained the top lacing and you could see a great pack of muscle\nshifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body\ncapable of enormous leverage--a cruel body.\n\nHis speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of\nfractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in\nit, even toward people he liked--and there were men at New Haven who had\nhated his guts.\n\n\"Now, don't think my opinion on these matters is final,\" he seemed to\nsay, \"just because I'm stronger and more of a man than you are.\" We\nwere in the same Senior Society, and while we were never intimate I\nalways had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like\nhim with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.\n\nWe talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.\n\n\"I've got a nice place here,\" he said, his eyes flashing about\nrestlessly.\n\nTurning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat hand along the\nfront vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half\nacre of deep pungent roses and a snub-nosed motor boat that bumped\nthe tide off shore.\n\n\"It belonged to Demaine the oil man.\" He turned me around again,\npolitely and abruptly. \"We'll go inside.\"\n\nWe walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space,\nfragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end.\nThe windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass\noutside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze\nblew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other\nlike pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of\nthe ceiling--and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a\nshadow on it as wind does on the sea.\n\nThe only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch\non which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored\nballoon. They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and\nfluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight\naround the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the\nwhip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall.\nThen there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught\nwind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two\nyoung women ballooned slowly to the floor.\n\nThe younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length\nat her end of the divan, completely motionless and with her chin raised\na little as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely\nto fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of\nit--indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having\ndisturbed her by coming in.\n\nThe other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise--she leaned slightly\nforward with a conscientious expression--then she laughed, an absurd,\ncharming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the\nroom.\n\n\"I'm p-paralyzed with happiness.\"\n\nShe laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand\nfor a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one\nin the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had.\nShe hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker.\n(I've heard it said that Daisy's murmur was only to make people\nlean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)\n\nAt any rate Miss Baker's lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost\nimperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back again--the object\nshe was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something\nof a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any\nexhibition of complete self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.\n\nI looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low,\nthrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and\ndown as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be\nplayed again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,\nbright eyes and a bright passionate mouth--but there was an excitement\nin her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget:\na singing compulsion, a whispered \"Listen,\" a promise that she had done\ngay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,\nexciting things hovering in the next hour.\n\nI told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way east\nand how a dozen people had sent their love through me.\n\n\"Do they miss me?\" she cried ecstatically.\n\n\"The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel\npainted black as a mourning wreath and there's a persistent wail all\nnight along the North Shore.\"\n\n\"How gorgeous! Let's go back, Tom. Tomorrow!\" Then she added\nirrelevantly, \"You ought to see the baby.\"\n\n\"I'd like to.\"\n\n\"She's asleep. She's two years old. Haven't you ever seen her?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Well, you ought to see her. She's----\"\n\nTom Buchanan who had been hovering restlessly about the room stopped\nand rested his hand on my shoulder.\n\n\"What you doing, Nick?\"\n\n\"I'm a bond man.\"\n\n\"Who with?\"\n\nI told him.\n\n\"Never heard of them,\" he remarked decisively.\n\nThis annoyed me.\n\n\"You will,\" I answered shortly. \"You will if you stay in the East.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll stay in the East, don't you worry,\" he said, glancing at\nDaisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more.\n\"I'd be a God Damned fool to live anywhere else.\"\n\nAt this point Miss Baker said \"Absolutely!\" with such suddenness that I\nstarted--it was the first word she uttered since I came into the room.\nEvidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and\nwith a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.\n\n\"I'm stiff,\" she complained, \"I've been lying on that sofa for as long\nas I can remember.\"\n\n\"Don't look at me,\" Daisy retorted. \"I've been trying to get you to New\nYork all afternoon.\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the\npantry, \"I'm absolutely in training.\"\n\nHer host looked at her incredulously.\n\n\"You are!\" He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of\na glass. \"How you ever get anything done is beyond me.\"\n\nI looked at Miss Baker wondering what it was she \"got done.\" I enjoyed\nlooking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect\ncarriage which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the\nshoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at\nme with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming discontented\nface. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her,\nsomewhere before.\n\n\"You live in West Egg,\" she remarked contemptuously. \"I know somebody\nthere.\"\n\n\"I don't know a single----\"\n\n\"You must know Gatsby.\"\n\n\"Gatsby?\" demanded Daisy. \"What Gatsby?\"\n\nBefore I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced;\nwedging his tense arm imperatively under mine Tom Buchanan compelled\nme from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.\n\nSlenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips the two\nyoung women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch open toward the\nsunset where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished\nwind.\n\n\"Why CANDLES?\" objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her\nfingers. \"In two weeks it'll be the longest day in the year.\"\nShe looked at us all radiantly. \"Do you always watch for the longest day\nof the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the\nyear and then miss it.\"\n\n\"We ought to plan something,\" yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the\ntable as if she were getting into bed.\n\n\"All right,\" said Daisy. \"What'll we plan?\" She turned to me helplessly.\n\"What do people plan?\"\n\nBefore I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her\nlittle finger.\n\n\"Look!\" she complained. \"I hurt it.\"\n\nWe all looked--the knuckle was black and blue.\n\n\"You did it, Tom,\" she said accusingly. \"I know you didn't mean to\nbut you DID do it. That's what I get for marrying a brute of a man,\na great big hulking physical specimen of a----\"\n\n\"I hate that word hulking,\" objected Tom crossly, \"even in kidding.\"\n\n\"Hulking,\" insisted Daisy.\n\nSometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a\nbantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool\nas their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all\ndesire. They were here--and they accepted Tom and me, making only a\npolite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew\nthat presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too\nwould be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the\nWest where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its\nclose in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer\nnervous dread of the moment itself.\n\n\"You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,\" I confessed on my second glass\nof corky but rather impressive claret. \"Can't you talk about crops or\nsomething?\"\n\nI meant nothing in particular by this remark but it was taken up in an\nunexpected way.\n\n\"Civilization's going to pieces,\" broke out Tom violently.\n\"I've gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read\n'The Rise of the Coloured Empires' by this man Goddard?\"\n\n\"Why, no,\" I answered, rather surprised by his tone.\n\n\"Well, it's a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if\nwe don't look out the white race will be--will be utterly submerged.\nIt's all scientific stuff; it's been proved.\"\n\n\"Tom's getting very profound,\" said Daisy with an expression of\nunthoughtful sadness. \"He reads deep books with long words in them.\nWhat was that word we----\"\n\n\"Well, these books are all scientific,\" insisted Tom, glancing at her\nimpatiently. \"This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up to us\nwho are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have\ncontrol of things.\"\n\n\"We've got to beat them down,\" whispered Daisy, winking ferociously\ntoward the fervent sun.\n\n\"You ought to live in California--\" began Miss Baker but Tom\ninterrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.\n\n\"This idea is that we're Nordics. I am, and you are and you are\nand----\" After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a\nslight nod and she winked at me again. \"--and we've produced all the\nthings that go to make civilization--oh, science and art and all that.\nDo you see?\"\n\nThere was something pathetic in his concentration as if his complacency,\nmore acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. When, almost\nimmediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy\nseized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.\n\n\"I'll tell you a family secret,\" she whispered enthusiastically. \"It's\nabout the butler's nose. Do you want to hear about the butler's nose?\"\n\n\"That's why I came over tonight.\"\n\n\"Well, he wasn't always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for\nsome people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people.\nHe had to polish it from morning till night until finally it began to\naffect his nose----\"\n\n\"Things went from bad to worse,\" suggested Miss Baker.\n\n\"Yes. Things went from bad to worse until finally he had to give up\nhis position.\"\n\nFor a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon\nher glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as\nI listened--then the glow faded, each light deserting her with\nlingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.\n\nThe butler came back and murmured something close to Tom's ear\nwhereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair and without a word went\ninside. As if his absence quickened something within her Daisy leaned\nforward again, her voice glowing and singing.\n\n\"I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a--of a rose, an\nabsolute rose. Doesn't he?\" She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation.\n\"An absolute rose?\"\n\nThis was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only\nextemporizing but a stirring warmth flowed from her as if her\nheart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those\nbreathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the\ntable and excused herself and went into the house.\n\nMiss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of\nmeaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said \"Sh!\" in\na warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room\nbeyond and Miss Baker leaned forward, unashamed, trying to hear. The\nmurmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted\nexcitedly, and then ceased altogether.\n\n\"This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor----\" I said.\n\n\"Don't talk. I want to hear what happens.\"\n\n\"Is something happening?\" I inquired innocently.\n\n\"You mean to say you don't know?\" said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.\n\"I thought everybody knew.\"\n\n\"I don't.\"\n\n\"Why----\" she said hesitantly, \"Tom's got some woman in New York.\"\n\n\"Got some woman?\" I repeated blankly.\n\nMiss Baker nodded.\n\n\"She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner-time. Don't\nyou think?\"\n\nAlmost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of\na dress and the crunch of leather boots and Tom and Daisy were back\nat the table.\n\n\"It couldn't be helped!\" cried Daisy with tense gayety.\n\nShe sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me and\ncontinued: \"I looked outdoors for a minute and it's very romantic\noutdoors. There's a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale\ncome over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He's singing away----\" her\nvoice sang \"----It's romantic, isn't it, Tom?\"\n\n\"Very romantic,\" he said, and then miserably to me: \"If it's light enough\nafter dinner I want to take you down to the stables.\"\n\nThe telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her\nhead decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all\nsubjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the\nlast five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again,\npointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every\none and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn't guess what Daisy and Tom\nwere thinking but I doubt if even Miss Baker who seemed to have\nmastered a certain hardy skepticism was able utterly to put this fifth\nguest's shrill metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament\nthe situation might have seemed intriguing--my own instinct was to\ntelephone immediately for the police.\n\nThe horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss\nBaker, with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into\nthe library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while\ntrying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf I followed\nDaisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In\nits deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.\n\nDaisy took her face in her hands, as if feeling its lovely shape, and\nher eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent\nemotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some\nsedative questions about her little girl.\n\n\"We don't know each other very well, Nick,\" she said suddenly.\n\"Even if we are cousins. You didn't come to my wedding.\"\n\n\"I wasn't back from the war.\"\n\n\"That's true.\" She hesitated. \"Well, I've had a very bad time, Nick,\nand I'm pretty cynical about everything.\"\n\nEvidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn't say any more,\nand after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her\ndaughter.\n\n\"I suppose she talks, and--eats, and everything.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\" She looked at me absently. \"Listen, Nick; let me tell you what\nI said when she was born. Would you like to hear?\"\n\n\"Very much.\"\n\n\"It'll show you how I've gotten to feel about--things. Well, she was less\nthan an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether\nwith an utterly abandoned feeling and asked the nurse right away if it\nwas a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head\naway and wept. 'All right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope\nshe'll be a fool--that's the best thing a girl can be in this world,\na beautiful little fool.\"\n\n\"You see I think everything's terrible anyhow,\" she went on in a\nconvinced way. \"Everybody thinks so--the most advanced people. And I KNOW.\nI've been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.\"\nHer eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom's, and she\nlaughed with thrilling scorn. \"Sophisticated--God, I'm sophisticated!\"\n\nThe instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention,\nmy belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said.\nIt made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick\nof some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited,\nand sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk\non her lovely face as if she had asserted her membership in a rather\ndistinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.\n\n\nInside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker\nsat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from\nthe \"Saturday Evening Post\"--the words, murmurous and\nuninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamp-light,\nbright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair,\nglinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender\nmuscles in her arms.\n\nWhen we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.\n\n\"To be continued,\" she said, tossing the magazine on the table, \"in our\nvery next issue.\"\n\nHer body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she\nstood up.\n\n\"Ten o'clock,\" she remarked, apparently finding the time on the\nceiling. \"Time for this good girl to go to bed.\"\n\n\"Jordan's going to play in the tournament tomorrow,\" explained Daisy,\n\"over at Westchester.\"\n\n\"Oh,--you're JORdan Baker.\"\n\nI knew now why her face was familiar--its pleasing contemptuous\nexpression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of\nthe sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I\nhad heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story,\nbut what it was I had forgotten long ago.\n\n\"Good night,\" she said softly. \"Wake me at eight, won't you.\"\n\n\"If you'll get up.\"\n\n\"I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.\"\n\n\"Of course you will,\" confirmed Daisy. \"In fact I think I'll arrange\na marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I'll sort of--oh--fling you\ntogether. You know--lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push\nyou out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing----\"\n\n\"Good night,\" called Miss Baker from the stairs. \"I haven't heard a word.\"\n\n\"She's a nice girl,\" said Tom after a moment. \"They oughtn't to let her\nrun around the country this way.\"\n\n\"Who oughtn't to?\" inquired Daisy coldly.\n\n\"Her family.\"\n\n\"Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick's\ngoing to look after her, aren't you, Nick? She's going to spend lots of\nweek-ends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very\ngood for her.\"\n\nDaisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.\n\n\"Is she from New York?\" I asked quickly.\n\n\"From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our\nbeautiful white----\"\n\n\"Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?\"\ndemanded Tom suddenly.\n\n\"Did I?\" She looked at me. \"I can't seem to remember, but I think\nwe talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I'm sure we did. It sort of\ncrept up on us and first thing you know----\"\n\n\"Don't believe everything you hear, Nick,\" he advised me.\n\nI said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later\nI got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood side by\nside in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor Daisy\nperemptorily called \"Wait!\n\n\"I forgot to ask you something, and it's important. We heard you were\nengaged to a girl out West.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" corroborated Tom kindly. \"We heard that you were\nengaged.\"\n\n\"It's libel. I'm too poor.\"\n\n\"But we heard it,\" insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in\na flower-like way. \"We heard it from three people so it must be true.\"\n\nOf course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn't even vaguely\nengaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the\nreasons I had come east. You can't stop going with an old friend on\naccount of rumors and on the other hand I had no intention of being\nrumored into marriage.\n\nTheir interest rather touched me and made them less remotely\nrich--nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove\naway. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of\nthe house, child in arms--but apparently there were no such intentions\nin her head. As for Tom, the fact that he \"had some woman in New York\"\nwas really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book.\nSomething was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his\nsturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.\n\nAlready it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside\ngarages, where new red gas-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I\nreached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for\na while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown\noff, leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees and\na persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the\nfrogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the\nmoonlight and turning my head to watch it I saw that I was not\nalone--fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my\nneighbor's mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets\nregarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely\nmovements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested\nthat it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was\nhis of our local heavens.\n\nI decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and\nthat would do for an introduction. But I didn't call to him for he gave\na sudden intimation that he was content to be alone--he stretched out his\narms toward the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him\nI could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward--and\ndistinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away,\nthat might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby\nhe had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n\n\nAbout half way between West Egg and New York the motor-road hastily\njoins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to\nshrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of\nashes--a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and\nhills and grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and\nchimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcendent effort, of\nmen who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.\nOccasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives\nout a ghastly creak and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey\nmen swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud\nwhich screens their obscure operations from your sight.\n\nBut above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift\nendlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T.\nJ. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and\ngigantic--their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face but,\ninstead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a\nnonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to\nfatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself\ninto eternal blindness or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes,\ndimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain, brood on over\nthe solemn dumping ground.\n\nThe valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and\nwhen the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on\nwaiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an\nhour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute and it was\nbecause of this that I first met Tom Buchanan's mistress.\n\nThe fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. His\nacquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular\nrestaurants with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about,\nchatting with whomsoever he knew. Though I was curious to see her I\nhad no desire to meet her--but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on\nthe train one afternoon and when we stopped by the ashheaps he jumped\nto his feet and taking hold of my elbow literally forced me from the\ncar.\n\n\"We're getting off!\" he insisted. \"I want you to meet my girl.\"\n\nI think he'd tanked up a good deal at luncheon and his determination to\nhave my company bordered on violence. The supercilious assumption was that\non Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.\n\nI followed him over a low white-washed railroad fence and we walked\nback a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg's persistent\nstare. The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick\nsitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street\nministering to it and contiguous to absolutely nothing. One of the\nthree shops it contained was for rent and another was an all-night\nrestaurant approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a\ngarage--Repairs. GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars Bought and Sold--and I followed\nTom inside.\n\nThe interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the\ndust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had\noccurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind and that\nsumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead when the\nproprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands\non a piece of waste. He was a blonde, spiritless man, anaemic, and\nfaintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his\nlight blue eyes.\n\n\"Hello, Wilson, old man,\" said Tom, slapping him jovially on the\nshoulder. \"How's business?\"\n\n\"I can't complain,\" answered Wilson unconvincingly. \"When are you going\nto sell me that car?\"\n\n\"Next week; I've got my man working on it now.\"\n\n\"Works pretty slow, don't he?\"\n\n\"No, he doesn't,\" said Tom coldly. \"And if you feel that way about it,\nmaybe I'd better sell it somewhere else after all.\"\n\n\"I don't mean that,\" explained Wilson quickly. \"I just meant----\"\n\nHis voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage. Then\nI heard footsteps on a stairs and in a moment the thickish figure of a\nwoman blocked out the light from the office door. She was in the middle\nthirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously\nas some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue\ncrepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty but there was an\nimmediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body\nwere continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and walking through her\nhusband as if he were a ghost shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in\nthe eye. Then she wet her lips and without turning around spoke to her\nhusband in a soft, coarse voice:\n\n\"Get some chairs, why don't you, so somebody can sit down.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" agreed Wilson hurriedly and went toward the little office,\nmingling immediately with the cement color of the walls. A white ashen\ndust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in\nthe vicinity--except his wife, who moved close to Tom.\n\n\"I want to see you,\" said Tom intently. \"Get on the next train.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\n\"I'll meet you by the news-stand on the lower level.\"\n\nShe nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson\nemerged with two chairs from his office door.\n\nWe waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days before\nthe Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting\ntorpedoes in a row along the railroad track.\n\n\"Terrible place, isn't it,\" said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor\nEckleburg.\n\n\"Awful.\"\n\n\"It does her good to get away.\"\n\n\"Doesn't her husband object?\"\n\n\"Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He's so dumb\nhe doesn't know he's alive.\"\n\nSo Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York--or not\nquite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom\ndeferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be\non the train.\n\nShe had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin which stretched\ntight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in\nNew York. At the news-stand she bought a copy of \"Town Tattle\" and a\nmoving-picture magazine and, in the station drug store, some cold cream\nand a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive\nshe let four taxi cabs drive away before she selected a new one,\nlavender-colored with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the\nmass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she\nturned sharply from the window and leaning forward tapped on the\nfront glass.\n\n\"I want to get one of those dogs,\" she said earnestly. \"I want to get one\nfor the apartment. They're nice to have--a dog.\"\n\nWe backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John\nD. Rockefeller. In a basket, swung from his neck, cowered a dozen very\nrecent puppies of an indeterminate breed.\n\n\"What kind are they?\" asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly as he came to the\ntaxi-window.\n\n\"All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?\"\n\n\"I'd like to get one of those police dogs; I don't suppose you got that\nkind?\"\n\nThe man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew\none up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.\n\n\"That's no police dog,\" said Tom.\n\n\"No, it's not exactly a polICE dog,\" said the man with disappointment\nin his voice. \"It's more of an airedale.\" He passed his hand over the\nbrown wash-rag of a back. \"Look at that coat. Some coat. That's a dog\nthat'll never bother you with catching cold.\"\n\n\"I think it's cute,\" said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. \"How much is it?\"\n\n\"That dog?\" He looked at it admiringly. \"That dog will cost you ten\ndollars.\"\n\nThe airedale--undoubtedly there was an airedale concerned in it somewhere\nthough its feet were startlingly white--changed hands and settled down\ninto Mrs. Wilson's lap, where she fondled the weather-proof coat with\nrapture.\n\n\"Is it a boy or a girl?\" she asked delicately.\n\n\"That dog? That dog's a boy.\"\n\n\"It's a bitch,\" said Tom decisively. \"Here's your money. Go and buy ten\nmore dogs with it.\"\n\nWe drove over to Fifth Avenue, so warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the\nsummer Sunday afternoon that I wouldn't have been surprised to see a great\nflock of white sheep turn the corner.\n\n\"Hold on,\" I said, \"I have to leave you here.\"\n\n\"No, you don't,\" interposed Tom quickly. \"Myrtle'll be hurt if you don't \ncome up to the apartment. Won't you,\nMyrtle?\"\n\n\"Come on,\" she urged. \"I'll telephone my sister Catherine. She's said to\nbe very beautiful by people who ought to know.\"\n\n\"Well, I'd like to, but----\"\n\nWe went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds.\nAt 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of\napartment houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the\nneighborhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases\nand went haughtily in.\n\n\"I'm going to have the McKees come up,\" she announced as we rose in the\nelevator. \"And of course I got to call up my sister, too.\"\n\nThe apartment was on the top floor--a small living room, a small\ndining room, a small bedroom and a bath. The living room was crowded to\nthe doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it\nso that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of\nladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was\nan over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred\nrock. Looked at from a distance however the hen resolved itself\ninto a bonnet and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down\ninto the room. Several old copies of \"Town Tattle \"lay on the table\ntogether with a copy of \"Simon Called Peter\" and some of the small\nscandal magazines of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with\nthe dog. A reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and\nsome milk to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large\nhard dog biscuits--one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer\nof milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whiskey\nfrom a locked bureau door.\n\nI have been drunk just twice in my life and the second time was that\nafternoon so everything that happened has a dim hazy cast over it\nalthough until after eight o'clock the apartment was full of cheerful\nsun. Sitting on Tom's lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the\ntelephone; then there were no cigarettes and I went out to buy some at\nthe drug store on the corner. When I came back they had disappeared so\nI sat down discreetly in the living room and read a chapter of \"Simon\nCalled Peter\"--either it was terrible stuff or the whiskey distorted\nthings because it didn't make any sense to me.\n\nJust as Tom and Myrtle--after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called\neach other by our first names--reappeared, company commenced to arrive\nat the apartment door.\n\nThe sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty\nwith a solid sticky bob of red hair and a complexion powdered milky\nwhite. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more\nrakish angle but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the\nold alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about\nthere was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets\njingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary\nhaste and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered\nif she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated\nmy question aloud and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel.\n\nMr. McKee was a pale feminine man from the flat below. He had just\nshaved for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone and he\nwas most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He\ninformed me that he was in the \"artistic game\" and I gathered later\nthat he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs.\nWilson's mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His wife\nwas shrill, languid, handsome and horrible. She told me with pride\nthat her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven times\nsince they had been married.\n\nMrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before and was now\nattired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream colored chiffon, which\ngave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room.\nWith the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a\nchange. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage\nwas converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her\nassertions became more violently affected moment by moment and as she\nexpanded the room grew smaller around her until she seemed to be\nrevolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.\n\n\"My dear,\" she told her sister in a high mincing shout, \"most of these\nfellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I had a\nwoman up here last week to look at my feet and when she gave me the\nbill you'd of thought she had my appendicitus out.\"\n\n\"What was the name of the woman?\" asked Mrs. McKee.\n\n\"Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people's feet in their own\nhomes.\"\n\n\"I like your dress,\" remarked Mrs. McKee, \"I think it's adorable.\"\n\nMrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.\n\n\"It's just a crazy old thing,\" she said. \"I just slip it on sometimes when\nI don't care what I look like.\"\n\n\"But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,\" pursued\nMrs. McKee. \"If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could\nmake something of it.\"\n\nWe all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson who removed a strand of hair from\nover her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee\nregarded her intently with his head on one side and then moved his hand\nback and forth slowly in front of his face.\n\n\"I should change the light,\" he said after a moment. \"I'd like to bring\nout the modelling of the features. And I'd try to get hold of all the\nback hair.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't think of changing the light,\" cried Mrs. McKee. \"I think\nit's----\"\n\nHer husband said \"SH!\" and we all looked at the subject again whereupon\nTom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.\n\n\"You McKees have something to drink,\" he said. \"Get some more ice and\nmineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.\"\n\n\"I told that boy about the ice.\" Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair\nat the shiftlessness of the lower orders. \"These people! You have to keep\nafter them all the time.\"\n\nShe looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the\ndog, kissed it with ecstasy and swept into the kitchen, implying that\na dozen chefs awaited her orders there.\n\n\"I've done some nice things out on Long Island,\" asserted Mr. McKee.\n\nTom looked at him blankly.\n\n\"Two of them we have framed downstairs.\"\n\n\"Two what?\" demanded Tom.\n\n\"Two studies. One of them I call 'Montauk Point--the Gulls,' and the\nother I call 'Montauk Point--the Sea.' \"\n\nThe sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.\n\n\"Do you live down on Long Island, too?\" she inquired.\n\n\"I live at West Egg.\"\n\n\"Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named\nGatsby's. Do you know him?\"\n\n\"I live next door to him.\"\n\n\"Well, they say he's a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm's. That's\nwhere all his money comes from.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"I'm scared of him. I'd hate to have him get anything on me.\"\n\nThis absorbing information about my neighbor was interrupted by\nMrs. McKee's pointing suddenly at Catherine:\n\n\"Chester, I think you could do something with HER,\" she broke out,\nbut Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way and turned his attention\nto Tom.\n\n\"I'd like to do more work on Long Island if I could get the entry. All\nI ask is that they should give me a start.\"\n\n\"Ask Myrtle,\" said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as\nMrs. Wilson entered with a tray. \"She'll give you a letter of\nintroduction, won't you, Myrtle?\"\n\n\"Do what?\" she asked, startled.\n\n\"You'll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can\ndo some studies of him.\" His lips moved silently for a moment as he\ninvented. \" 'George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,' or something like\nthat.\"\n\n\nCatherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear: \"Neither of them\ncan stand the person they're married to.\"\n\n\"Can't they?\"\n\n\"Can't STAND them.\" She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. \"What I say is,\nwhy go on living with them if they can't stand them? If I was them I'd get\na divorce and get married to each other right away.\"\n\n\"Doesn't she like Wilson either?\"\n\nThe answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle who had overheard\nthe question and it was violent and obscene.\n\n\"You see?\" cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again.\n\"It's really his wife that's keeping them apart. She's a Catholic and\nthey don't believe in divorce.\"\n\nDaisy was not a Catholic and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness\nof the lie.\n\n\"When they do get married,\" continued Catherine, \"they're going west to\nlive for a while until it blows over.\"\n\n\"It'd be more discreet to go to Europe.\"\n\n\"Oh, do you like Europe?\" she exclaimed surprisingly. \"I just got back\nfrom Monte Carlo.\"\n\n\"Really.\"\n\n\"Just last year. I went over there with another girl.\"\n\n\"Stay long?\"\n\n\"No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way of Marseilles.\nWe had over twelve hundred dollars when we started but we got gypped\nout of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had an awful time\ngetting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town!\"\n\nThe late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue\nhoney of the Mediterranean--then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me\nback into the room.\n\n\"I almost made a mistake, too,\" she declared vigorously. \"I almost\nmarried a little kyke who'd been after me for years. I knew he was\nbelow me. Everybody kept saying to me: 'Lucille, that man's way below\nyou!' But if I hadn't met Chester, he'd of got me sure.\"\n\n\"Yes, but listen,\" said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down,\n\"at least you didn't marry him.\"\n\n\"I know I didn't.\"\n\n\"Well, I married him,\" said Myrtle, ambiguously. \"And that's the\ndifference between your case and mine.\"\n\n\"Why did you, Myrtle?\" demanded Catherine. \"Nobody forced you to.\"\n\nMyrtle considered.\n\n\"I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,\" she said finally.\n\"I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn't fit to lick\nmy shoe.\"\n\n\"You were crazy about him for a while,\" said Catherine.\n\n\"Crazy about him!\" cried Myrtle incredulously. \"Who said I was crazy about\nhim? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man\nthere.\"\n\nShe pointed suddenly at me, and every one looked at me accusingly.\nI tried to show by my expression that I had played no part in her past.\n\n\"The only CRAZY I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made a\nmistake. He borrowed somebody's best suit to get married in and never\neven told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he was out.\nShe looked around to see who was listening: \" 'Oh, is that your suit?' I \nsaid.\n'This is the first I ever heard about it.' But I gave it to him and then I \nlay down\nand cried to beat the band all afternoon.\"\n\n\"She really ought to get away from him,\" resumed Catherine to me.\n\"They've been living over that garage for eleven years. And Tom's the\nfirst sweetie she ever had.\"\n\nThe bottle of whiskey--a second one--was now in constant demand by all\npresent, excepting Catherine who \"felt just as good on nothing at all.\"\nTom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches,\nwhich were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted to get out and walk\neastward toward the park through the soft twilight but each time I tried\nto go I became entangled in some wild strident argument which pulled me\nback, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city our line of\nyellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the\ncasual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and\nwondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled\nby the inexhaustible variety of life.\n\nMyrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath\npoured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.\n\n\"It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the\nlast ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my\nsister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather\nshoes and I couldn't keep my eyes off him but every time he looked at\nme I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head.\nWhen we came into the station he was next to me and his white\nshirt-front pressed against my arm--and so I told him I'd have to call\na policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into\na taxi with him I didn't hardly know I wasn't getting into a subway\ntrain. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was 'You can't live\nforever, you can't live forever.' \"\n\nShe turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial\nlaughter.\n\n\"My dear,\" she cried, \"I'm going to give you this dress as soon as I'm\nthrough with it. I've got to get another one tomorrow. I'm going to\nmake a list of all the things I've got to get. A massage and a wave\nand a collar for the dog and one of those cute little ash-trays where\nyou touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother's\ngrave that'll last all summer. I got to write down a list so I won't\nforget all the things I got to do.\"\n\nIt was nine o'clock--almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch\nand found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists\nclenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out my\nhandkerchief I wiped from his cheek the remains of the spot of dried\nlather that had worried me all the afternoon.\n\nThe little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through\nthe smoke and from time to time groaning faintly. People disappeared,\nreappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other,\nsearched for each other, found each other a few feet away. Some time\ntoward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face\ndiscussing in impassioned voices whether Mrs. Wilson had any right to\nmention Daisy's name.\n\n\"Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!\" shouted Mrs. Wilson. \"I'll say it whenever I want\nto! Daisy! Dai----\"\n\nMaking a short deft movement Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his\nopen hand.\n\nThen there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women's\nvoices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of\npain. Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the door.\nWhen he had gone half way he turned around and stared at the scene--his\nwife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and\nthere among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and the\ndespairing figure on the couch bleeding fluently and trying to spread\na copy of \"Town Tattle\" over the tapestry scenes of Versailles.\nThen Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the door. Taking my hat from\nthe chandelier I followed.\n\n\"Come to lunch some day,\" he suggested, as we groaned down in the\nelevator.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Anywhere.\"\n\n\"Keep your hands off the lever,\" snapped the elevator boy.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. McKee with dignity, \"I didn't know I was\ntouching it.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I agreed, \"I'll be glad to.\"\n\n. . . I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the\nsheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.\n\n\"Beauty and the Beast . . . Loneliness . . . Old Grocery Horse . . .\nBrook'n Bridge . . . .\"\n\nThen I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the Pennsylvania\nStation, staring at the morning \"Tribune\" and waiting for the four\no'clock train.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n\n\nThere was music from my neighbor's house through the summer nights. In\nhis blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the\nwhisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the\nafternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft or\ntaking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats\nslit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of\nfoam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties\nto and from the city, between nine in the morning and long past\nmidnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to\nmeet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants including an extra\ngardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers\nand garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.\n\nEvery Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer\nin New York--every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back\ndoor in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the\nkitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an\nhour, if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler's\nthumb.\n\nAt least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several\nhundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas\ntree of Gatsby's enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with\nglistening hors-d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of\nharlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold.\nIn the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked\nwith gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of\nhis female guests were too young to know one from another.\n\nBy seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived--no thin five-piece affair\nbut a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and\ncornets and piccolos and low and high drums. The last swimmers have\ncome in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from\nNew York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and\nsalons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors and hair shorn in\nstrange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The\nbar is in full swing and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the\ngarden outside until the air is alive with chatter and laughter and\ncasual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and\nenthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names.\n\nThe lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and\nnow the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music and the opera of\nvoices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier, minute by minute,\nspilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups\nchange more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the\nsame breath--already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave\nhere and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp,\njoyous moment the center of a group and then excited with triumph\nglide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the\nconstantly changing light.\n\nSuddenly one of these gypsies in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out\nof the air, dumps it down for courage and moving her hands like\nFrisco dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; the\norchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her and there is a\nburst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda\nGray's understudy from the \"Follies.\" The party has begun.\n\nI believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby's house I was one of\nthe few guests who had actually been invited. People were not\ninvited--they went there. They got into automobiles which bore them out\nto Long Island and somehow they ended up at Gatsby's door. Once there\nthey were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby and after that they\nconducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with\namusement parks. Sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby\nat all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own\nticket of admission.\n\nI had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of robin's egg\nblue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly\nformal note from his employer--the honor would be entirely Gatsby's, it\nsaid, if I would attend his \"little party\" that night. He had\nseen me several times and had intended to call on me long before\nbut a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it--signed\nJay Gatsby in a majestic hand.\n\nDressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after\nseven and wandered around rather ill-at-ease among swirls and eddies\nof people I didn't know--though here and there was a face I had noticed\non the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number of young\nEnglishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry\nand all talking in low earnest voices to solid and prosperous\nAmericans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or\ninsurance or automobiles. They were, at least, agonizingly aware of the\neasy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few\nwords in the right key.\n\nAs soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host but the two or\nthree people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an\namazed way and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements\nthat I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table--the only place\nin the garden where a single man could linger without looking\npurposeless and alone.\n\nI was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when\nJordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble\nsteps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest\ndown into the garden.\n\nWelcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone\nbefore I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passers-by.\n\n\"Hello!\" I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturally\nloud across the garden.\n\n\"I thought you might be here,\" she responded absently as I came up.\n\"I remembered you lived next door to----\"\n\nShe held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she'd take care\nof me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses\nwho stopped at the foot of the steps.\n\n\"Hello!\" they cried together. \"Sorry you didn't win.\"\n\nThat was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week\nbefore.\n\n\"You don't know who we are,\" said one of the girls in yellow, \"but we\nmet you here about a month ago.\"\n\n\"You've dyed your hair since then,\" remarked Jordan, and I started\nbut the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the\npremature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer's\nbasket. With Jordan's slender golden arm resting in mine we descended\nthe steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated at\nus through the twilight and we sat down at a table with the two girls in\nyellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble.\n\n\"Do you come to these parties often?\" inquired Jordan of the girl\nbeside her.\n\n\"The last one was the one I met you at,\" answered the girl, in an alert,\nconfident voice. She turned to her companion: \"Wasn't it for you,\nLucille?\"\n\nIt was for Lucille, too.\n\n\"I like to come,\" Lucille said. \"I never care what I do, so I always have\na good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked\nme my name and address--inside of a week I got a package from Croirier's\nwith a new evening gown in it.\"\n\n\"Did you keep it?\" asked Jordan.\n\n\"Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the\nbust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two\nhundred and sixty-five dollars.\"\n\n\"There's something funny about a fellow that'll do a thing like that,\"\nsaid the other girl eagerly. \"He doesn't want any trouble with ANYbody.\"\n\n\"Who doesn't?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Gatsby. Somebody told me----\"\n\nThe two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.\n\n\"Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.\"\n\nA thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and\nlistened eagerly.\n\n\"I don't think it's so much THAT,\" argued Lucille skeptically; \"it's\nmore that he was a German spy during the war.\"\n\nOne of the men nodded in confirmation.\n\n\"I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in\nGermany,\" he assured us positively.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said the first girl, \"it couldn't be that, because he was in\nthe American army during the war.\" As our credulity switched back to\nher she leaned forward with enthusiasm. \"You look at him sometimes when\nhe thinks nobody's looking at him. I'll bet he killed a man.\"\n\nShe narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned and\nlooked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic speculation he\ninspired that there were whispers about him from those who found little\nthat it was necessary to whisper about in this world.\n\nThe first supper--there would be another one after midnight--was now\nbeing served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party who were\nspread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were\nthree married couples and Jordan's escort, a persistent undergraduate\ngiven to violent innuendo and obviously under the impression\nthat sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person\nto a greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling this party\nhad preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the\nfunction of representing the staid nobility of the countryside--East\nEgg condescending to West Egg, and carefully on guard against its\nspectroscopic gayety.\n\n\"Let's get out,\" whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and\ninappropriate half hour. \"This is much too polite for me.\"\n\nWe got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host--I\nhad never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The\nundergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.\n\nThe bar, where we glanced first, was crowded but Gatsby was not there.\nShe couldn't find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn't on the\nveranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked\ninto a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and\nprobably transported complete from some ruin overseas.\n\nA stout, middle-aged man with enormous owl-eyed spectacles was\nsitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with\nunsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he\nwheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.\n\n\"What do you think?\" he demanded impetuously.\n\n\"About what?\"\n\nHe waved his hand toward the book-shelves.\n\n\"About that. As a matter of fact you needn't bother to ascertain. I\nascertained. They're real.\"\n\n\"The books?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Absolutely real--have pages and everything. I thought they'd be a nice\ndurable cardboard. Matter of fact, they're absolutely real. Pages\nand--Here! Lemme show you.\"\n\nTaking our skepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and\nreturned with Volume One of the \"Stoddard Lectures.\"\n\n\"See!\" he cried triumphantly. \"It's a bona fide piece of printed matter.\nIt fooled me. This fella's a regular Belasco. It's a triumph. What\nthoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop too--didn't cut the pages.\nBut what do you want? What do you expect?\"\n\nHe snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf\nmuttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable\nto collapse.\n\n\"Who brought you?\" he demanded. \"Or did you just come? I was brought.\nMost people were brought.\"\n\nJordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully without answering.\n\n\"I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,\" he continued. \"Mrs. Claud\nRoosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I've\nbeen drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me\nup to sit in a library.\"\n\n\"Has it?\"\n\n\"A little bit, I think. I can't tell yet. I've only been here\nan hour. Did I tell you about the books? They're real. They're----\"\n\n\"You told us.\"\n\nWe shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.\n\nThere was dancing now on the canvas in the garden, old men pushing\nyoung girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples\nholding each other tortuously, fashionably and keeping in the\ncorners--and a great number of single girls dancing individualistically\nor relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or\nthe traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had\nsung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz and between\nthe numbers people were doing \"stunts\" all over the garden, while happy\nvacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage\n\"twins\"--who turned out to be the girls in yellow--did a baby act in\ncostume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger bowls.\nThe moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of\nsilver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the\nbanjoes on the lawn.\n\nI was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of\nabout my age and a rowdy little girl who gave way upon the slightest\nprovocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now. I\nhad taken two finger bowls of champagne and the scene had changed\nbefore my eyes into something significant, elemental and profound.\n\nAt a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.\n\n\"Your face is familiar,\" he said, politely. \"Weren't you in the Third\nDivision during the war?\"\n\n\"Why, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-Gun Battalion.\"\n\n\"I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I'd\nseen you somewhere before.\"\n\nWe talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France.\nEvidently he lived in this vicinity for he told me that he had just\nbought a hydroplane and was going to try it out in the morning.\n\n\"Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.\"\n\n\"What time?\"\n\n\"Any time that suits you best.\"\n\nIt was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around\nand smiled.\n\n\"Having a gay time now?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Much better.\" I turned again to my new acquaintance. \"This is an unusual\nparty for me. I haven't even seen the host. I live over there----\" I waved\nmy hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, \"and this man Gatsby sent\nover his chauffeur with an invitation.\"\n\nFor a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.\n\n\"I'm Gatsby,\" he said suddenly.\n\n\"What!\" I exclaimed. \"Oh, I beg your pardon.\"\n\n\"I thought you knew, old sport. I'm afraid I'm not a very good host.\"\n\nHe smiled understandingly--much more than understandingly. It was\none of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance\nin it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or\nseemed to face--the whole external world for an instant, and then\nconcentrated on YOU with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It\nunderstood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in\nyou as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it\nhad precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to\nconvey. Precisely at that point it vanished--and I was looking at an\nelegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate\nformality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he\nintroduced himself I'd got a strong impression that he was picking his\nwords with care.\n\nAlmost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler\nhurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on\nthe wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us\nin turn.\n\n\"If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,\" he urged me.\n\"Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.\"\n\nWhen he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan--constrained to assure her\nof my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and\ncorpulent person in his middle years.\n\n\"Who is he?\" I demanded. \"Do you know?\"\n\n\"He's just a man named Gatsby.\"\n\n\"Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?\"\n\n\"Now YOU're started on the subject,\" she answered with a wan smile.\n\"Well,--he told me once he was an Oxford man.\"\n\nA dim background started to take shape behind him but at her\nnext remark it faded away.\n\n\"However, I don't believe it.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she insisted, \"I just don't think he went there.\"\n\nSomething in her tone reminded me of the other girl's \"I think\nhe killed a man,\" and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I\nwould have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang\nfrom the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York.\nThat was comprehensible. But young men didn't--at least in my provincial\ninexperience I believed they didn't--drift coolly out of nowhere and buy\na palace on Long Island Sound.\n\n\"Anyhow he gives large parties,\" said Jordan, changing the subject\nwith an urbane distaste for the concrete. \"And I like large parties.\nThey're so intimate. At small parties there isn't any privacy.\"\n\nThere was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader\nrang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he cried. \"At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are\ngoing to play for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff's latest work which attracted\nso much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers\nyou know there was a big sensation.\" He smiled with jovial condescension\nand added \"Some sensation!\" whereupon everybody laughed.\n\n\"The piece is known,\" he concluded lustily, \"as 'Vladimir Tostoff's\nJazz History of the World.' \"\n\nThe nature of Mr. Tostoff's composition eluded me, because just as\nit began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps\nand looking from one group to another with approving eyes.\nHis tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and\nhis short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day. I could\nsee nothing sinister about him. I wondered if the fact that he was\nnot drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed\nto me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased.\nWhen the \"Jazz History of the World\" was over girls were putting\ntheir heads on men's shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were\nswooning backward playfully into men's arms, even into groups knowing\nthat some one would arrest their falls--but no one swooned backward on\nGatsby and no French bob touched Gatsby's shoulder and no singing\nquartets were formed with Gatsby's head for one link.\n\n\"I beg your pardon.\"\n\nGatsby's butler was suddenly standing beside us.\n\n\"Miss Baker?\" he inquired. \"I beg your pardon but Mr. Gatsby would like\nto speak to you alone.\"\n\n\"With me?\" she exclaimed in surprise.\n\n\"Yes, madame.\"\n\nShe got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment,\nand followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore\nher evening dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes--there\nwas a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to\nwalk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.\n\nI was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and\nintriguing sounds had issued from a long many-windowed room which\noverhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan's undergraduate who was now\nengaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who\nimplored me to join him, I went inside.\n\nThe large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was\nplaying the piano and beside her stood a tall, red haired young lady\nfrom a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of\nchampagne and during the course of her song she had decided ineptly\nthat everything was very very sad--she was not only singing, she was\nweeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with\ngasping broken sobs and then took up the lyric again in a quavering\nsoprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks--not freely, however, for when\nthey came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an\ninky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. A\nhumorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face\nwhereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair and went off into\na deep vinous sleep.\n\n\"She had a fight with a man who says he's her husband,\" explained a\ngirl at my elbow.\n\nI looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights\nwith men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan's party, the quartet\nfrom East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was\ntalking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife after\nattempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent\nway broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks--at intervals she\nappeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed \"You\npromised!\" into his ear.\n\nThe reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall was at\npresent occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant\nwives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised\nvoices.\n\n\"Whenever he sees I'm having a good time he wants to go home.\"\n\n\"Never heard anything so selfish in my life.\"\n\n\"We're always the first ones to leave.\"\n\n\"So are we.\"\n\n\"Well, we're almost the last tonight,\" said one of the men sheepishly.\n\"The orchestra left half an hour ago.\"\n\nIn spite of the wives' agreement that such malevolence was beyond\ncredibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were\nlifted kicking into the night.\n\nAs I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and\nJordan Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last word\nto her but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into\nformality as several people approached him to say goodbye.\n\nJordan's party were calling impatiently to her from the porch but she\nlingered for a moment to shake hands.\n\n\"I've just heard the most amazing thing,\" she whispered. \"How long were\nwe in there?\"\n\n\"Why,--about an hour.\"\n\n\"It was--simply amazing,\" she repeated abstractedly. \"But I swore\nI wouldn't tell it and here I am tantalizing you.\" She yawned\ngracefully in my face. \"Please come and see me. . . . Phone book.\n. . . Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard. . . . My aunt. . . .\"\nShe was hurrying off as she talked--her brown hand waved a\njaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door.\n\nRather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I\njoined the last of Gatsby's guests who were clustered around him. I\nwanted to explain that I'd hunted for him early in the evening and to\napologize for not having known him in the garden.\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" he enjoined me eagerly. \"Don't give it another\nthought, old sport.\" The familiar expression held no more familiarity\nthan the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. \"And don't forget\nwe're going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning at nine o'clock.\"\n\nThen the butler, behind his shoulder:\n\n\"Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.\"\n\n\"All right, in a minute. Tell them I'll be right there. . . . good\nnight.\"\n\n\"Good night.\"\n\n\"Good night.\" He smiled--and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant\nsignificance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired\nit all the time. \"Good night, old sport. . . . Good night.\"\n\nBut as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over.\nFifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and\ntumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side up but\nviolently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coup\u00e9 which had left Gatsby's\ndrive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the\ndetachment of the wheel which was now getting considerable attention from\nhalf a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as they had left their cars\nblocking the road a harsh discordant din from those in the rear had been\naudible for some time and added to the already violent confusion of\nthe scene.\n\nA man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in\nthe middle of the road, looking from the car to the tire and from the\ntire to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.\n\n\"See!\" he explained. \"It went in the ditch.\"\n\nThe fact was infinitely astonishing to him--and I recognized first the\nunusual quality of wonder and then the man--it was the late patron of\nGatsby's library.\n\n\"How'd it happen?\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I know nothing whatever about mechanics,\" he said decisively.\n\n\"But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?\"\n\n\"Don't ask me,\" said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter.\n\"I know very little about driving--next to nothing. It happened,\nand that's all I know.\"\n\n\"Well, if you're a poor driver you oughtn't to try driving at night.\"\n\n\"But I wasn't even trying,\" he explained indignantly, \"I wasn't even\ntrying.\"\n\nAn awed hush fell upon the bystanders.\n\n\"Do you want to commit suicide?\"\n\n\"You're lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even TRYing!\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" explained the criminal. \"I wasn't driving. There's\nanother man in the car.\"\n\nThe shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained\n\"Ah-h-h!\" as the door of the coup\u00e9 swung slowly open. The crowd--it was\nnow a crowd--stepped back involuntarily and when the door had opened wide\nthere was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale\ndangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the\nground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.\n\nBlinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant\ngroaning of the horns the apparition stood swaying for a moment before\nhe perceived the man in the duster.\n\n\"Wha's matter?\" he inquired calmly. \"Did we run outa gas?\"\n\n\"Look!\"\n\nHalf a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel--he stared\nat it for a moment and then looked upward as though he suspected that\nit had dropped from the sky.\n\n\"It came off,\" some one explained.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"At first I din' notice we'd stopped.\"\n\nA pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders\nhe remarked in a determined voice:\n\n\"Wonder'ff tell me where there's a gas'line station?\"\n\nAt least a dozen men, some of them little better off than he was,\nexplained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical\nbond.\n\n\"Back out,\" he suggested after a moment. \"Put her in reverse.\"\n\n\"But the WHEEL'S off!\"\n\nHe hesitated.\n\n\"No harm in trying,\" he said.\n\nThe caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and\ncut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a moon\nwas shining over Gatsby's house, making the night fine as before and\nsurviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. A\nsudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great\ndoors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host who\nstood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.\n\n\nReading over what I have written so far I see I have given the\nimpression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all\nthat absorbed me. On the contrary they were merely casual events in a\ncrowded summer and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less\nthan my personal affairs.\n\nMost of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my shadow\nwestward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the\nProbity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their\nfirst names and lunched with them in dark crowded restaurants on\nlittle pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I even had a short\naffair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the\naccounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my\ndirection so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow\nquietly away.\n\nI took dinner usually at the Yale Club--for some reason it was the\ngloomiest event of my day--and then I went upstairs to the library and\nstudied investments and securities for a conscientious hour.\nThere were generally a few rioters around but they never came into the\nlibrary so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was\nmellow I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel\nand over Thirty-third Street to the Pennsylvania Station.\n\nI began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night\nand the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and\nmachines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and\npick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few\nminutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever\nknow or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their\napartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled\nback at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the\nenchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes,\nand felt it in others--poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows\nwaiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner--young clerks\nin the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.\n\nAgain at eight o'clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were five\ndeep with throbbing taxi cabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a\nsinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited,\nand voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted\ncigarettes outlined unintelligible gestures inside. Imagining that\nI, too, was hurrying toward gayety and sharing their intimate\nexcitement, I wished them well.\n\nFor a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found\nher again. At first I was flattered to go places with her because she\nwas a golf champion and every one knew her name. Then it was\nsomething more. I wasn't actually in love, but I felt a sort of\ntender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the\nworld concealed something--most affectations conceal something\neventually, even though they don't in the beginning--and one day I found\nwhat it was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she\nleft a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied\nabout it--and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded\nme that night at Daisy's. At her first big golf tournament there was a\nrow that nearly reached the newspapers--a suggestion that she had moved\nher ball from a bad lie in the semi-final round. The thing approached\nthe proportions of a scandal--then died away. A caddy retracted his\nstatement and the only other witness admitted that he might have been\nmistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.\n\nJordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw\nthat this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence\nfrom a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest.\nShe wasn't able to endure being at a disadvantage, and given this\nunwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she\nwas very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the\nworld and yet satisfy the demands of her hard jaunty body.\n\nIt made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never\nblame deeply--I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that\nsame house party that we had a curious conversation about driving a\ncar. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our\nfender flicked a button on one man's coat.\n\n\"You're a rotten driver,\" I protested. \"Either you ought to be more\ncareful or you oughtn't to drive at all.\"\n\n\"I am careful.\"\n\n\"No, you're not.\"\n\n\"Well, other people are,\" she said lightly.\n\n\"What's that got to do with it?\"\n\n\"They'll keep out of my way,\" she insisted. \"It takes two to make an\naccident.\"\n\n\"Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.\"\n\n\"I hope I never will,\" she answered. \"I hate careless people. That's why\nI like you.\"\n\nHer grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had\ndeliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved\nher. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes\non my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of\nthat tangle back home. I'd been writing letters once a week and signing\nthem: \"Love, Nick,\" and all I could think of was how, when that certain\ngirl played tennis, a faint mustache of perspiration appeared on her\nupper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be\ntactfully broken off before I was free.\n\nEvery one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and\nthis is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n\n\nOn Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages along shore\nthe world and its mistress returned to Gatsby's house and twinkled\nhilariously on his lawn.\n\n\"He's a bootlegger,\" said the young ladies, moving somewhere between\nhis cocktails and his flowers. \"One time he killed a man who had found out\nthat he was nephew to von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil.\nReach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there crystal\nglass.\"\n\nOnce I wrote down on the empty spaces of a time-table the names\nof those who came to Gatsby's house that summer. It is an old time-table\nnow, disintegrating at its folds and headed \"This schedule in effect\nJuly 5th, 1922.\" But I can still read the grey names and they will give\nyou a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted\nGatsby's hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing\nwhatever about him.\n\nFrom East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches and a\nman named Bunsen whom I knew at Yale and Doctor Webster Civet who\nwas drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie\nVoltaires and a whole clan named Blackbuck who always gathered in a\ncorner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near.\nAnd the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr.\nChrystie's wife) and Edgar Beaver, whose hair they say turned\ncotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.\n\nClarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only\nonce, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named\nEtty in the garden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles\nand the O. R. P. Schraeders and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of\nGeorgia and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there\nthree days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the\ngravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett's automobile ran over his right\nhand. The Dancies came too and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over\nsixty, and Maurice A. Flink and the Hammerheads and Beluga the\ntobacco importer and Beluga's girls.\n\nFrom West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and\nCecil Schoen and Gulick the state senator and Newton Orchid who\ncontrolled Films Par Excellence and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don\nS. Schwartze (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the\nmovies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G.\nEarl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife.\nDa Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B.\n(\"Rot-Gut\") Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly--they came to\ngamble and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was\ncleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably\nnext day.\n\nA man named Klipspringer was there so often and so long that he became\nknown as \"the boarder\"--I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical\npeople there were Gus Waize and Horace O'Donavan and Lester Meyer and\nGeorge Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes\nand the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the\nCorrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W.\nBelcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry\nL. Palmetto who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train\nin Times Square.\n\nBenny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite\nthe same ones in physical person but they were so identical one with\nanother that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have\nforgotten their names--Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela or Gloria\nor Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names\nof flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American\ncapitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves to\nbe.\n\nIn addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O'Brien came\nthere at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer who had\nhis nose shot off in the war and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his\nfianc\u00e9e, and Ardita Fitz-Peters, and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of the\nAmerican Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip with a man reputed to be her\nchauffeur, and a prince of something whom we called Duke and whose name,\nif I ever knew it, I have forgotten.\n\nAll these people came to Gatsby's house in the summer.\n\n\nAt nine o'clock, one morning late in July Gatsby's gorgeous car\nlurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody\nfrom its three noted horn. It was the first time he had called on me\nthough I had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane,\nand, at his urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach.\n\n\"Good morning, old sport. You're having lunch with me today and I\nthought we'd ride up together.\"\n\nHe was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that\nresourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American--that comes,\nI suppose, with the absence of lifting work or rigid sitting in youth\nand, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games.\nThis quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in\nthe shape of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a\ntapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.\n\nHe saw me looking with admiration at his car.\n\n\"It's pretty, isn't it, old sport.\" He jumped off to give me a better\nview. \"Haven't you ever seen it before?\"\n\nI'd seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream color, bright\nwith nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with\ntriumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a\nlabyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind\nmany layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory we started\nto town.\n\nI had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and\nfound, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first\nimpression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had\ngradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate\nroadhouse next door.\n\nAnd then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn't reached West Egg\nvillage before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished\nand slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-colored\nsuit.\n\n\"Look here, old sport,\" he broke out surprisingly. \"What's your opinion\nof me, anyhow?\"\n\nA little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which\nthat question deserves.\n\n\"Well, I'm going to tell you something about my life,\" he interrupted.\n\"I don't want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you\nhear.\"\n\nSo he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavored conversation in\nhis halls.\n\n\"I'll tell you God's truth.\" His right hand suddenly ordered divine\nretribution to stand by. \"I am the son of some wealthy people in the\nmiddle-west--all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at\nOxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years.\nIt is a family tradition.\"\n\nHe looked at me sideways--and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was\nlying. He hurried the phrase \"educated at Oxford,\" or swallowed it or\nchoked on it as though it had bothered him before. And with this doubt\nhis whole statement fell to pieces and I wondered if there wasn't\nsomething a little sinister about him after all.\n\n\"What part of the middle-west?\" I inquired casually.\n\n\"San Francisco.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\n\"My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.\"\n\nHis voice was solemn as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan\nstill haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg\nbut a glance at him convinced me otherwise.\n\n\"After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of\nEurope--Paris, Venice, Rome--collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting\nbig game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to\nforget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.\"\n\nWith an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very\nphrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a\nturbaned \"character\" leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a\ntiger through the Bois de Boulogne.\n\n\"Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief and I tried very\nhard to die but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a\ncommission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I\ntook two machine-gun detachments so far forward that there was a half\nmile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn't advance. We\nstayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty men with\nsixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last they found\nthe insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead. I was\npromoted to be a major and every Allied government gave me a\ndecoration--even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic\nSea!\"\n\nLittle Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them--with\nhis smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro's troubled history and\nsympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It\nappreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had\nelicited this tribute from Montenegro's warm little heart. My\nincredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming\nhastily through a dozen magazines.\n\nHe reached in his pocket and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon, fell\ninto my palm.\n\n\"That's the one from Montenegro.\"\n\nTo my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look.\n\n_Orderi di Danilo_, ran the circular legend, _Montenegro, Nicolas Rex_.\n\n\"Turn it.\"\n\n_Major Jay Gatsby_, I read, _For Valour Extraordinary_.\n\n\"Here's another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It was\ntaken in Trinity Quad--the man on my left is now the Earl of Dorcaster.\"\n\nIt was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an\narchway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby,\nlooking a little, not much, younger--with a cricket bat in his hand.\n\nThen it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace\non the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with\ntheir crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.\n\n\"I'm going to make a big request of you today,\" he said, pocketing his\nsouvenirs with satisfaction, \"so I thought you ought to know something\nabout me. I didn't want you to think I was just some nobody. You see,\nI usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there\ntrying to forget the sad thing that happened to me.\" He hesitated.\n\"You'll hear about it this afternoon.\"\n\n\"At lunch?\"\n\n\"No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you're taking Miss Baker\nto tea.\"\n\n\"Do you mean you're in love with Miss Baker?\"\n\n\"No, old sport, I'm not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak\nto you about this matter.\"\n\nI hadn't the faintest idea what \"this matter\" was, but I was more\nannoyed than interested. I hadn't asked Jordan to tea in order to discuss\nMr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something utterly\nfantastic and for a moment I was sorry I'd ever set foot upon his\noverpopulated lawn.\n\nHe wouldn't say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared\nthe city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of\nred-belted ocean-going ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with\nthe dark, undeserted saloons of the faded gilt nineteen-hundreds. Then\nthe valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a glimpse\nof Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we\nwent by.\n\nWith fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half\nAstoria--only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the\nelevated I heard the familiar \"jug--jug--SPAT!\" of a motor cycle, and a\nfrantic policeman rode alongside.\n\n\"All right, old sport,\" called Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a white\ncard from his wallet he waved it before the man's eyes.\n\n\"Right you are,\" agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. \"Know you next\ntime, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse ME!\"\n\n\"What was that?\" I inquired.  \"The picture of Oxford?\"\n\n\"I was able to do the commissioner a favor once, and he sends me a\nChristmas card every year.\"\n\nOver the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a\nconstant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the\nriver in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of\nnon-olfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always\nthe city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the\nmystery and the beauty in the world.\n\nA dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two\ncarriages with drawn blinds and by more cheerful carriages for\nfriends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short\nupper lips of south-eastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of\nGatsby's splendid car was included in their somber holiday. As we\ncrossed Blackwell's Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white\nchauffeur, in which sat three modish Negroes, two bucks and a girl. I\nlaughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in\nhaughty rivalry.\n\n\"Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge,\" I thought;\n\"anything at all. . . .\"\n\nEven Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.\n\n\nRoaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby\nfor lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside my eyes\npicked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.\n\n\"Mr. Carraway this is my friend Mr. Wolfsheim.\"\n\nA small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two\nfine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I\ndiscovered his tiny eyes in the half darkness.\n\n\"--so I took one look at him--\" said Mr. Wolfsheim, shaking my hand\nearnestly, \"--and what do you think I did?\"\n\n\"What?\" I inquired politely.\n\nBut evidently he was not addressing me for he dropped my hand and\ncovered Gatsby with his expressive nose.\n\n\"I handed the money to Katspaugh and I sid, 'All right, Katspaugh,\ndon't pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.' He shut it then and\nthere.\"\n\nGatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the\nrestaurant whereupon Mr. Wolfsheim swallowed a new sentence he was\nstarting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.\n\n\"Highballs?\" asked the head waiter.\n\n\"This is a nice restaurant here,\" said Mr. Wolfsheim looking at the\nPresbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. \"But I like across the street better!\"\n\n\"Yes, highballs,\" agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfsheim: \"It's too hot\nover there.\"\n\n\"Hot and small--yes,\" said Mr. Wolfsheim, \"but full of memories.\"\n\n\"What place is that?\" I asked.\n\n\"The old Metropole.\n\n\"The old Metropole,\" brooded Mr. Wolfsheim gloomily. \"Filled with faces\ndead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can't forget so\nlong as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It was six of us\nat the table and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening. When it was\nalmost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says\nsomebody wants to speak to him outside. 'All right,' says Rosy and begins\nto get up and I pulled him down in his chair.\n\n\" 'Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don't you,\nso help me, move outside this room.'\n\n\"It was four o'clock in the morning then, and if we'd of raised the blinds\nwe'd of seen daylight.\"\n\n\"Did he go?\" I asked innocently.\n\n\"Sure he went,\"--Mr. Wolfsheim's nose flashed at me indignantly--\"He\nturned around in the door and says, 'Don't let that waiter take away\nmy coffee!' Then he went out on the sidewalk and they shot him\nthree times in his full belly and drove away.\"\n\n\"Four of them were electrocuted,\" I said, remembering.\n\n\"Five with Becker.\" His nostrils turned to me in an interested way.\n\"I understand you're looking for a business gonnegtion.\"\n\nThe juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered\nfor me:\n\n\"Oh, no,\" he exclaimed, \"this isn't the man!\"\n\n\"No?\" Mr. Wolfsheim seemed disappointed.\n\n\"This is just a friend. I told you we'd talk about that some other\ntime.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. Wolfsheim, \"I had a wrong man.\"\n\nA succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfsheim, forgetting the more\nsentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with\nferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the\nroom--he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly\nbehind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have taken one\nshort glance beneath our own table.\n\n\"Look here, old sport,\" said Gatsby, leaning toward me, \"I'm afraid I\nmade you a little angry this morning in the car.\"\n\nThere was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.\n\n\"I don't like mysteries,\" I answered. \"And I don't understand why you\nwon't come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got to\ncome through Miss Baker?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing underhand,\" he assured me. \"Miss Baker's a great\nsportswoman, you know, and she'd never do anything that wasn't all right.\"\n\nSuddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up and hurried from the room\nleaving me with Mr. Wolfsheim at the table.\n\n\"He has to telephone,\" said Mr. Wolfsheim, following him with his eyes.\n\"Fine fellow, isn't he? Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"He's an Oggsford man.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?\"\n\n\"I've heard of it.\"\n\n\"It's one of the most famous colleges in the world.\"\n\n\"Have you known Gatsby for a long time?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Several years,\" he answered in a gratified way. \"I made the pleasure of\nhis acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a man of\nfine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to myself: 'There's\nthe kind of man you'd like to take home and introduce to your mother and\nsister.' \" He paused. \"I see you're looking at my cuff buttons.\"\n\nI hadn't been looking at them, but I did now.  They were composed of\noddly familiar pieces of ivory.\n\n\"Finest specimens of human molars,\" he informed me.\n\n\"Well!\" I inspected them. \"That's a very interesting idea.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. \"Yeah, Gatsby's very\ncareful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend's wife.\"\n\nWhen the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat\ndown Mr. Wolfsheim drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet.\n\n\"I have enjoyed my lunch,\" he said, \"and I'm going to run off from you\ntwo young men before I outstay my welcome.\"\n\n\"Don't hurry, Meyer,\" said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfsheim\nraised his hand in a sort of benediction.\n\n\"You're very polite but I belong to another generation,\" he announced\nsolemnly. \"You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and\nyour----\" He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his\nhand--\"As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won't impose myself\non you any longer.\"\n\nAs he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling.\nI wondered if I had said anything to offend him.\n\n\"He becomes very sentimental sometimes,\" explained Gatsby. \"This is one of\nhis sentimental days. He's quite a character around New York--a denizen of\nBroadway.\"\n\n\"Who is he anyhow--an actor?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"A dentist?\"\n\n\"Meyer Wolfsheim? No, he's a gambler.\" Gatsby hesitated, then added\ncoolly: \"He's the man who fixed the World's Series back in 1919.\"\n\n\"Fixed the World's Series?\" I repeated.\n\nThe idea staggered me. I remembered of course that the World's Series\nhad been fixed in 1919 but if I had thought of it at all I would have\nthought of it as a thing that merely HAPPENED, the end of some\ninevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could start to\nplay with the faith of fifty million people--with the single-mindedness\nof a burglar blowing a safe.\n\n\"How did he happen to do that?\" I asked after a minute.\n\n\"He just saw the opportunity.\"\n\n\"Why isn't he in jail?\"\n\n\"They can't get him, old sport. He's a smart man.\"\n\nI insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I caught\nsight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.\n\n\"Come along with me for a minute,\" I said. \"I've got to say hello\nto someone.\"\n\nWhen he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our\ndirection.\n\n\"Where've you been?\" he demanded eagerly. \"Daisy's furious because you\nhaven't called up.\"\n\n\"This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.\"\n\nThey shook hands briefly and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment\ncame over Gatsby's face.\n\n\"How've you been, anyhow?\" demanded Tom of me. \"How'd you happen to come\nup this far to eat?\"\n\n\"I've been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.\"\n\nI turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.\n\n\nOne October day in nineteen-seventeen----\n(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight\nchair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)\n--I was walking along from one place to another half on the sidewalks and\nhalf on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from\nEngland with rubber nobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground.\nI had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind and\nwhenever this happened the red, white and blue banners in front of all\nthe houses stretched out stiff and said TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT in a disapproving\nway.\n\nThe largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to\nDaisy Fay's house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and\nby far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She\ndressed in white, and had a little white roadster and all day long\nthe telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp\nTaylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night, \"anyways,\nfor an hour!\"\n\nWhen I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside\nthe curb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen\nbefore. They were so engrossed in each other that she didn't see me until\nI was five feet away.\n\n\"Hello Jordan,\" she called unexpectedly. \"Please come here.\"\n\nI was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older\ngirls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and\nmake bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn't come\nthat day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way\nthat every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it\nseemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since. His name\nwas Jay Gatsby and I didn't lay eyes on him again for over four\nyears--even after I'd met him on Long Island I didn't realize it was the\nsame man.\n\nThat was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux myself,\nand I began to play in tournaments, so I didn't see Daisy very often.\nShe went with a slightly older crowd--when she went with anyone at all.\nWild rumors were circulating about her--how her mother had found her\npacking her bag one winter night to go to New York and say goodbye to a\nsoldier who was going overseas. She was effectually prevented, but she\nwasn't on speaking terms with her family for several weeks. After\nthat she didn't play around with the soldiers any more but only\nwith a few flat-footed, short-sighted young men in town who couldn't\nget into the army at all.\n\nBy the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a debut\nafter the Armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a\nman from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago with\nmore pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He came\ndown with a hundred people in four private cars and hired a whole\nfloor of the Seelbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave her\na string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\n\nI was bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the bridal\ndinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in\nher flowered dress--and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle of\nsauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.\n\n\" 'Gratulate me,\" she muttered. \"Never had a drink before but oh, how I do\nenjoy it.\"\n\n\"What's the matter, Daisy?\"\n\nI was scared, I can tell you; I'd never seen a girl like that before.\n\n\"Here, dearis.\" She groped around in a waste-basket she had with her\non the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. \"Take 'em downstairs and\ngive 'em back to whoever they belong to. Tell 'em all Daisy's change' her\nmine. Say 'Daisy's change' her mine!'.\"\n\nShe began to cry--she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her\nmother's maid and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath. She\nwouldn't let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her and\nsqueezed it up into a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the\nsoap dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.\n\nBut she didn't say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and put\nice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress and half an\nhour later when we walked out of the room the pearls were around her\nneck and the incident was over. Next day at five o'clock she married Tom\nBuchanan without so much as a shiver and started off on a three months'\ntrip to the South Seas.\n\nI saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back and I thought I'd\nnever seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he left the room for a\nminute she'd look around uneasily and say \"Where's Tom gone?\" and\nwear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the\ndoor. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour\nrubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable\ndelight. It was touching to see them together--it made you laugh in a\nhushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I left Santa\nBarbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night and ripped\na front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got into the\npapers too because her arm was broken--she was one of the chambermaids\nin the Santa Barbara Hotel.\n\nThe next April Daisy had her little girl and they went to France for a\nyear. I saw them one spring in Cannes and later in Deauville and then\nthey came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in Chicago,\nas you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich\nand wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation.\nPerhaps because she doesn't drink. It's a great advantage not to drink\namong hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and, moreover,\nyou can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else\nis so blind that they don't see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in\nfor amour at all--and yet there's something in that voice of hers. . . .\n\nWell, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time\nin years. It was when I asked you--do you remember?--if you knew Gatsby\nin West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me\nup, and said \"What Gatsby?\" and when I described him--I was half\nasleep--she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used\nto know. It wasn't until then that I connected this Gatsby with the\nofficer in her white car.\n\n\nWhen Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza\nfor half an hour and were driving in a Victoria through Central Park.\nThe sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in\nthe West Fifties and the clear voices of girls, already gathered like\ncrickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:\n\n\n    \"I'm the Sheik of Araby,\n    Your love belongs to me.\n    At night when you're asleep,\n    Into your tent I'll creep----\"\n\n\n\"It was a strange coincidence,\" I said.\n\n\"But it wasn't a coincidence at all.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.\"\n\nThen it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired\non that June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the\nwomb of his purposeless splendor.\n\n\"He wants to know--\" continued Jordan \"--if you'll invite Daisy to your\nhouse some afternoon and then let him come over.\"\n\nThe modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and bought a\nmansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths so that he could\n\"come over\" some afternoon to a stranger's garden.\n\n\"Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?\"\n\n\"He's afraid. He's waited so long. He thought you might be offended.\nYou see he's a regular tough underneath it all.\"\n\nSomething worried me.\n\n\"Why didn't he ask you to arrange a meeting?\"\n\n\"He wants her to see his house,\" she explained. \"And your house is right\nnext door.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties,\nsome night,\" went on Jordan, \"but she never did. Then he began asking\npeople casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found.\nIt was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have\nheard the elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately\nsuggested a luncheon in New York--and I thought he'd go mad:\n\n\" 'I don't want to do anything out of the way!' he kept saying. 'I want to\nsee her right next door.'\n\n\"When I said you were a particular friend of Tom's he started to abandon\nthe whole idea. He doesn't know very much about Tom, though he says he's\nread a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse\nof Daisy's name.\"\n\nIt was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm\naround Jordan's golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to\ndinner. Suddenly I wasn't thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more but of\nthis clean, hard, limited person who dealt in universal skepticism and\nwho leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm. A phrase began\nto beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: \"There are only the\npursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.\"\n\n\"And Daisy ought to have something in her life,\" murmured Jordan to me.\n\n\"Does she want to see Gatsby?\"\n\n\"She's not to know about it. Gatsby doesn't want her to know. You're\njust supposed to invite her to tea.\"\n\nWe passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the facade of Fifty-ninth\nStreet, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park.\nUnlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan I had no girl whose disembodied face\nfloated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so I drew up the\ngirl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth smiled and so\nI drew her up again, closer, this time to my face.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n\n\nWhen I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that\nmy house was on fire. Two o'clock and the whole corner of the peninsula\nwas blazing with light which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin\nelongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a corner I saw that it\nwas Gatsby's house, lit from tower to cellar.\n\nAt first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved\nitself into \"hide-and-go-seek\" or \"sardines-in-the-box\" with all the\nhouse thrown open to the game. But there wasn't a sound. Only wind in\nthe trees which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again\nas if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned away I\nsaw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.\n\n\"Your place looks like the world's fair,\" I said.\n\n\"Does it?\" He turned his eyes toward it absently. \"I have been glancing\ninto some of the rooms. Let's go to Coney Island, old sport. In my car.\"\n\n\"It's too late.\"\n\n\"Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven't made use\nof it all summer.\"\n\n\"I've got to go to bed.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nHe waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.\n\n\"I talked with Miss Baker,\" I said after a moment. \"I'm going to call up\nDaisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" he said carelessly. \"I don't want to put you to\nany trouble.\"\n\n\"What day would suit you?\"\n\n\"What day would suit YOU?\" he corrected me quickly. \"I don't want to put\nyou to any trouble, you see.\"\n\n\"How about the day after tomorrow?\" He considered for a moment. Then,\nwith reluctance:\n\n\"I want to get the grass cut,\" he said.\n\nWe both looked at the grass--there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn\nended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I suspected that\nhe meant my grass.\n\n\"There's another little thing,\" he said uncertainly, and hesitated.\n\n\"Would you rather put it off for a few days?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, it isn't about that. At least----\" He fumbled with a series of\nbeginnings. \"Why, I thought--why, look here, old sport, you don't make\nmuch money, do you?\"\n\n\"Not very much.\"\n\nThis seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.\n\n\"I thought you didn't, if you'll pardon my--you see, I carry on a\nlittle business on the side, a sort of sideline, you understand. And I\nthought that if you don't make very much--You're selling bonds, aren't\nyou, old sport?\"\n\n\"Trying to.\"\n\n\"Well, this would interest you. It wouldn't take up much of your\ntime and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be\na rather confidential sort of thing.\"\n\nI realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might\nhave been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer was\nobviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no choice\nexcept to cut him off there.\n\n\"I've got my hands full,\" I said. \"I'm much obliged but I couldn't take\non any more work.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't have to do any business with Wolfsheim.\" Evidently he\nthought that I was shying away from the \"gonnegtion\" mentioned at lunch,\nbut I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer, hoping I'd\nbegin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went\nunwillingly home.\n\nThe evening had made me light-headed and happy; I think I walked into a\ndeep sleep as I entered my front door. So I didn't know whether or not\nGatsby went to Coney Island or for how many hours he \"glanced into\nrooms\" while his house blazed gaudily on. I called up Daisy from the\noffice next morning and invited her to come to tea.\n\n\"Don't bring Tom,\" I warned her.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Don't bring Tom.\"\n\n\"Who is 'Tom'?\" she asked innocently.\n\nThe day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven o'clock a man in a\nraincoat dragging a lawn-mower tapped at my front door and said that\nMr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I\nhad forgotten to tell my Finn to come back so I drove into West Egg\nVillage to search for her among soggy white-washed alleys and to buy\nsome cups and lemons and flowers.\n\nThe flowers were unnecessary, for at two o'clock a greenhouse arrived\nfrom Gatsby's, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour\nlater the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel\nsuit, silver shirt and gold-colored tie hurried in. He was pale and\nthere were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.\n\n\"Is everything all right?\" he asked immediately.\n\n\"The grass looks fine, if that's what you mean.\"\n\n\"What grass?\" he inquired blankly. \"Oh, the grass in the yard.\" He looked\nout the window at it, but judging from his expression I don't believe\nhe saw a thing.\n\n\"Looks very good,\" he remarked vaguely. \"One of the papers said they\nthought the rain would stop about four. I think it was 'The Journal.' Have\nyou got everything you need in the shape of--of tea?\"\n\nI took him into the pantry where he looked a little reproachfully at the\nFinn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen\nshop.\n\n\"Will they do?\" I asked.\n\n\"Of course, of course! They're fine!\" and he added hollowly, \". . .old\nsport.\"\n\nThe rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist through which\noccasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes\nthrough a copy of Clay's \"Economics,\" starting at the Finnish tread that\nshook the kitchen floor and peering toward the bleared windows from time\nto time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking\nplace outside. Finally he got up and informed me in an uncertain voice\nthat he was going home.\n\n\"Why's that?\"\n\n\"Nobody's coming to tea. It's too late!\" He looked at his watch as if\nthere was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. \"I can't wait\nall day.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly; it's just two minutes to four.\"\n\nHe sat down, miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously there\nwas the sound of a motor turning into my lane. We both jumped up and,\na little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.\n\nUnder the dripping bare lilac trees a large open car was coming up the\ndrive. It stopped. Daisy's face, tipped sideways beneath a\nthree-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic\nsmile.\n\n\"Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?\"\n\nThe exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had\nto follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone\nbefore any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of\nblue paint across her cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as\nI took it to help her from the car.\n\n\"Are you in love with me,\" she said low in my ear. \"Or why did I have\nto come alone?\"\n\n\"That's the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far\naway and spend an hour.\"\n\n\"Come back in an hour, Ferdie.\" Then in a grave murmur, \"His name is\nFerdie.\"\n\n\"Does the gasoline affect his nose?\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" she said innocently. \"Why?\"\n\nWe went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living room was deserted.\n\n\"Well, that's funny!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"What's funny?\"\n\nShe turned her head as there was a light, dignified knocking at the front\ndoor. I went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands\nplunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of\nwater glaring tragically into my eyes.\n\nWith his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the\nhall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire and disappeared into the\nliving room. It wasn't a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of my own\nheart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.\n\nFor half a minute there wasn't a sound. Then from the living room I\nheard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh followed by Daisy's\nvoice on a clear artificial note.\n\n\"I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.\"\n\nA pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall so I went\ninto the room.\n\nGatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the\nmantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom.\nHis head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a\ndefunct mantelpiece clock and from this position his distraught eyes\nstared down at Daisy who was sitting frightened but graceful on the\nedge of a stiff chair.\n\n\"We've met before,\" muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily at\nme and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily\nthe clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his\nhead, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers and set\nit back in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the\nsofa and his chin in his hand.\n\n\"I'm sorry about the clock,\" he said.\n\nMy own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldn't muster up\na single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.\n\n\"It's an old clock,\" I told them idiotically.\n\nI think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on\nthe floor.\n\n\"We haven't met for many years,\" said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact\nas it could ever be.\n\n\"Five years next November.\"\n\nThe automatic quality of Gatsby's answer set us all back at least another\nminute. I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that\nthey help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in\non a tray.\n\nAmid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency\nestablished itself. Gatsby got himself into a shadow and while Daisy\nand I talked looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with\ntense unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn't an end in itself I\nmade an excuse at the first possible moment and got to my feet.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.\n\n\"I'll be back.\"\n\n\"I've got to speak to you about something before you go.\"\n\nHe followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door and whispered:\n\"Oh, God!\" in a miserable way.\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"This is a terrible mistake,\" he said, shaking his head from side to\nside, \"a terrible, terrible mistake.\"\n\n\"You're just embarrassed, that's all,\" and luckily I added: \"Daisy's\nembarrassed too.\"\n\n\"She's embarrassed?\" he repeated incredulously.\n\n\"Just as much as you are.\"\n\n\"Don't talk so loud.\"\n\n\"You're acting like a little boy,\" I broke out impatiently. \"Not only\nthat but you're rude. Daisy's sitting in there all alone.\"\n\n\nHe raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable\nreproach and opening the door cautiously went back into the other room.\n\nI walked out the back way--just as Gatsby had when he had made his\nnervous circuit of the house half an hour before--and ran for a huge\nblack knotted tree whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain.\nOnce more it was pouring and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by\nGatsby's gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric\nmarshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree except\nGatsby's enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church\nsteeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the \"period\"\ncraze, a decade before, and there was a story that he'd agreed to pay\nfive years' taxes on all the neighboring cottages if the owners would\nhave their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the\nheart out of his plan to Found a Family--he went into an immediate\ndecline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the\ndoor. Americans, while occasionally willing to be serfs, have always\nbeen obstinate about being peasantry.\n\nAfter half an hour the sun shone again and the grocer's automobile\nrounded Gatsby's drive with the raw material for his servants' dinner--I\nfelt sure he wouldn't eat a spoonful. A maid began opening the upper\nwindows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from a\nlarge central bay, spat meditatively into the garden. It was time I\nwent back. While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of\ntheir voices, rising and swelling a little, now and then, with gusts of\nemotion. But in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen within\nthe house too.\n\nI went in--after making every possible noise in the kitchen short of\npushing over the stove--but I don't believe they heard a sound. They\nwere sitting at either end of the couch looking at each other as if\nsome question had been asked or was in the air, and every vestige of\nembarrassment was gone. Daisy's face was smeared with tears and when I\ncame in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before\na mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding.\nHe literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new\nwell-being radiated from him and filled the little room.\n\n\"Oh, hello, old sport,\" he said, as if he hadn't seen me for years. I\nthought for a moment he was going to shake hands.\n\n\"It's stopped raining.\"\n\n\"Has it?\" When he realized what I was talking about, that there were\ntwinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man,\nlike an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to\nDaisy. \"What do you think of that? It's stopped raining.\"\n\n\"I'm glad, Jay.\" Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only\nof her unexpected joy.\n\n\"I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,\" he said, \"I'd like to\nshow her around.\"\n\n\"You're sure you want me to come?\"\n\n\"Absolutely, old sport.\"\n\nDaisy went upstairs to wash her face--too late I thought with humiliation\nof my towels--while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.\n\n\"My house looks well, doesn't it?\" he demanded. \"See how the whole\nfront of it catches the light.\"\n\nI agreed that it was splendid.\n\n\"Yes.\" His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. \"It took\nme just three years to earn the money that bought it.\"\n\n\"I thought you inherited your money.\"\n\n\"I did, old sport,\" he said automatically, \"but I lost most of it in\nthe big panic--the panic of the war.\"\n\nI think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what\nbusiness he was in he answered \"That's my affair,\" before he realized\nthat it wasn't the appropriate reply.\n\n\"Oh, I've been in several things,\" he corrected himself. \"I was in the\ndrug business and then I was in the oil business. But I'm not in either\none now.\" He looked at me with more attention. \"Do you mean you've been\nthinking over what I proposed the other night?\"\n\nBefore I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass\nbuttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.\n\n\"That huge place THERE?\" she cried pointing.\n\n\"Do you like it?\"\n\n\"I love it, but I don't see how you live there all alone.\"\n\n\"I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People who\ndo interesting things. Celebrated people.\"\n\nInstead of taking the short cut along the Sound we went down the road and\nentered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this\naspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the\ngardens, the sparkling odor of jonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn\nand plum blossoms and the pale gold odor of kiss-me-at-the-gate.\nIt was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright\ndresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the\ntrees.\n\nAnd inside as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music rooms and\nRestoration salons I felt that there were guests concealed behind\nevery couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we\nhad passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of \"the Merton College\nLibrary\" I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into\nghostly laughter.\n\nWe went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender\nsilk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing rooms and poolrooms,\nand bathrooms with sunken baths--intruding into one chamber where a\ndishevelled man in pajamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It\nwas Mr. Klipspringer, the \"boarder.\" I had seen him wandering hungrily\nabout the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby's own apartment,\na bedroom and a bath and an Adam study, where we sat down and drank a\nglass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall.\n\nHe hadn't once ceased looking at Daisy and I think he revalued\neverything in his house according to the measure of response it drew\nfrom her well-loved eyes. Sometimes, too, he stared around at his\npossessions in a dazed way as though in her actual and astounding\npresence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a\nflight of stairs.\n\nHis bedroom was the simplest room of all--except where the dresser was\ngarnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush\nwith delight and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and\nshaded his eyes and began to laugh.\n\n\"It's the funniest thing, old sport,\" he said hilariously. \"I can't--when\nI try to----\"\n\nHe had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third.\nAfter his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with\nwonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed it\nright through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak, at an\ninconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction, he was running\ndown like an overwound clock.\n\nRecovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent\ncabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and\nhis shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.\n\n\"I've got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection\nof things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.\"\n\nHe took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one\nbefore us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel\nwhich lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in\nmany-colored disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft\nrich heap mounted higher--shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in\ncoral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange with monograms of\nIndian blue. Suddenly with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into\nthe shirts and began to cry stormily.\n\n\"They're such beautiful shirts,\" she sobbed, her voice muffled in the\nthick folds. \"It makes me sad because I've never seen such--such beautiful\nshirts before.\"\n\n\nAfter the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and the\nhydroplane and the midsummer flowers--but outside Gatsby's window it\nbegan to rain again so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated\nsurface of the Sound.\n\n\"If it wasn't for the mist we could see your home across the bay,\" said\nGatsby. \"You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of\nyour dock.\"\n\nDaisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed\nin what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the\ncolossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared\nto the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed\nvery near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star\nto the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of\nenchanted objects had diminished by one.\n\nI began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in\nthe half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting\ncostume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.\n\n\"Who's this?\"\n\n\"That? That's Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.\"\n\nThe name sounded faintly familiar.\n\n\"He's dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.\"\n\nThere was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the\nbureau--Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly--taken apparently\nwhen he was about eighteen.\n\n\"I adore it!\" exclaimed Daisy. \"The pompadour! You never told me you had\na pompadour--or a yacht.\"\n\n\"Look at this,\" said Gatsby quickly. \"Here's a lot of clippings--about\nyou.\"\n\nThey stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the rubies\nwhen the phone rang and Gatsby took up the receiver.\n\n\"Yes. . . . Well, I can't talk now. . . . I can't talk now, old\nsport. . . . I said a SMALL town. . . . He must know what a small town\nis. . . . Well, he's no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small\ntown. . . .\"\n\nHe rang off.\n\n\"Come here QUICK!\" cried Daisy at the window.\n\nThe rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west,\nand there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.\n\n\"Look at that,\" she whispered, and then after a moment: \"I'd like to\njust get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you\naround.\"\n\nI tried to go then, but they wouldn't hear of it; perhaps my presence\nmade them feel more satisfactorily alone.\n\n\"I know what we'll do,\" said Gatsby, \"we'll have Klipspringer play the\npiano.\"\n\nHe went out of the room calling \"Ewing!\" and returned in a few\nminutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man with\nshell-rimmed glasses and scanty blonde hair. He was now decently clothed\nin a \"sport shirt\" open at the neck, sneakers and duck trousers of a\nnebulous hue.\n\n\"Did we interrupt your exercises?\" inquired Daisy politely.\n\n\"I was asleep,\" cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment.\n\"That is, I'd BEEN asleep. Then I got up. . . .\"\n\n\"Klipspringer plays the piano,\" said Gatsby, cutting him off. \"Don't you,\nEwing, old sport?\"\n\n\"I don't play well. I don't--I hardly play at all. I'm all out of\nprac----\"\n\n\"We'll go downstairs,\" interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The\ngrey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.\n\nIn the music room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano. He\nlit Daisy's cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on\na couch far across the room where there was no light save what the\ngleaming floor bounced in from the hall.\n\nWhen Klipspringer had played \"The Love Nest\" he turned around on the\nbench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.\n\n\"I'm all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn't play. I'm all\nout of prac----\"\n\n\"Don't talk so much, old sport,\" commanded Gatsby. \"Play!\"\n\n\n    IN THE MORNING,\n    IN THE EVENING,\n       AIN'T WE GOT FUN----\n\nOutside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the\nSound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains,\nmen-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York. It was\nthe hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating on\nthe air.\n\n\n    ONE THING'S SURE AND NOTHING'S SURER\n    THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET--CHILDREN.\n       IN THE MEANTIME,\n       IN BETWEEN TIME----\n\n\nAs I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of bewilderment\nhad come back into Gatsby's face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to\nhim as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost five\nyears! There must have been moments even that afternoon when\nDaisy tumbled short of his dreams--not through her own fault but\nbecause of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond\nher, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative\npassion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright\nfeather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can\nchallenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.\n\nAs I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took\nhold of hers and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward\nher with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most with its\nfluctuating, feverish warmth because it couldn't be over-dreamed--that\nvoice was a deathless song.\n\nThey had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand;\nGatsby didn't know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they\nlooked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I went out\nof the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there\ntogether.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n\n\nAbout this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one\nmorning at Gatsby's door and asked him if he had anything to say.\n\n\"Anything to say about what?\" inquired Gatsby politely.\n\n\"Why,--any statement to give out.\"\n\nIt transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard\nGatsby's name around his office in a connection which he either\nwouldn't reveal or didn't fully understand. This was his day off\nand with laudable initiative he had hurried out \"to see.\"\n\nIt was a random shot, and yet the reporter's instinct was right. Gatsby's\nnotoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his\nhospitality and so become authorities on his past, had increased\nall summer until he fell just short of being news. Contemporary\nlegends such as the \"underground pipe-line to Canada\" attached\nthemselves to him, and there was one persistent story that he\ndidn't live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house\nand was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore. Just why\nthese inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North\nDakota, isn't easy to say.\n\nJames Gatz--that was really, or at least legally, his name. He had\nchanged it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that\nwitnessed the beginning of his career--when he saw Dan Cody's yacht drop\nanchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior. It was James Gatz\nwho had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green\njersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby who\nborrowed a row-boat, pulled out to the TUOLOMEE and informed Cody that\na wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour.\n\nI suppose he'd had the name ready for a long time, even then. His\nparents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people--his imagination had\nnever really accepted them as his parents at all. The truth was that\nJay Gatsby, of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic\nconception of himself. He was a son of God--a phrase which, if it means\nanything, means just that--and he must be about His Father's Business,\nthe service of a vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty. So he invented\njust the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be\nlikely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.\n\nFor over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of\nLake Superior as a clam digger and a salmon fisher or in any other\ncapacity that brought him food and bed. His brown, hardening body lived\nnaturally through the half fierce, half lazy work of the bracing days.\nHe knew women early and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous\nof them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of the others\nbecause they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming\nself-absorption he took for granted.\n\nBut his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque\nand fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe\nof ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the\nclock ticked on the wash-stand and the moon soaked with wet\nlight his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the\npattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid\nscene with an oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an\noutlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the\nunreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded\nsecurely on a fairy's wing.\n\nAn instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to\nthe small Lutheran college of St. Olaf in southern Minnesota. He stayed\nthere two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of\nhis destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor's work with\nwhich he was to pay his way through. Then he drifted back to Lake\nSuperior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day\nthat Dan Cody's yacht dropped anchor in the shallows along shore.\n\nCody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields,\nof the Yukon, of every rush for metal since Seventy-five. The\ntransactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire\nfound him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and,\nsuspecting this an infinite number of women tried to separate him from\nhis money. The none too savory ramifications by which Ella Kaye, the\nnewspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him\nto sea in a yacht, were common knowledge to the turgid journalism\nof 1902. He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five\nyears when he turned up as James Gatz's destiny at Little Girl Bay.\n\nTo the young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed\ndeck, the yacht represented all the beauty and glamor in the world. I\nsuppose he smiled at Cody--he had probably discovered that people liked\nhim when he smiled. At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of\nthem elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick, and\nextravagantly ambitious. A few days later he took him to Duluth and\nbought him a blue coat, six pair of white duck trousers and a yachting\ncap. And when the TUOLOMEE left for the West Indies and the Barbary\nCoast Gatsby left too.\n\nHe was employed in a vague personal capacity--while he remained with\nCody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor,\nfor Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be\nabout and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more\ntrust in Gatsby. The arrangement lasted five years during which the\nboat went three times around the continent. It might have lasted\nindefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night\nin Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died.\n\nI remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby's bedroom, a grey, florid\nman with a hard empty face--the pioneer debauchee who during one phase\nof American life brought back to the eastern seaboard the savage\nviolence of the frontier brothel and saloon. It was indirectly due to\nCody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gay parties\nwomen used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the\nhabit of letting liquor alone.\n\nAnd it was from Cody that he inherited money--a legacy of twenty-five\nthousand dollars. He didn't get it. He never understood the legal\ndevice that was used against him but what remained of the millions\nwent intact to Ella Kaye. He was left with his singularly appropriate\neducation; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the\nsubstantiality of a man.\n\n\nHe told me all this very much later, but I've put it down here with the\nidea of exploding those first wild rumors about his antecedents, which\nweren't even faintly true. Moreover he told it to me at a time of\nconfusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and\nnothing about him. So I take advantage of this short halt, while\nGatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of\nmisconceptions away.\n\nIt was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. For\nseveral weeks I didn't see him or hear his voice on the phone--mostly\nI was in New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to\ningratiate myself with her senile aunt--but finally I went over to\nhis house one Sunday afternoon. I hadn't been there two minutes when\nsomebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink. I was startled,\nnaturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadn't happened\nbefore.\n\nThey were a party of three on horseback--Tom and a man named Sloane and\na pretty woman in a brown riding habit who had been there previously.\n\n\"I'm delighted to see you,\" said Gatsby standing on his porch.\n\"I'm delighted that you dropped in.\"\n\nAs though they cared!\n\n\"Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.\" He walked around the room\nquickly, ringing bells. \"I'll have something to drink for you in just\na minute.\"\n\nHe was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But he would be\nuneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in a vague\nway that that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted nothing. A\nlemonade? No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at all,\nthanks. . . . I'm sorry----\n\n\"Did you have a nice ride?\"\n\n\"Very good roads around here.\"\n\n\"I suppose the automobiles----\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nMoved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom who had accepted\nthe introduction as a stranger.\n\n\"I believe we've met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Tom, gruffly polite but obviously not remembering.\n\"So we did. I remember very well.\"\n\n\"About two weeks ago.\"\n\n\"That's right. You were with Nick here.\"\n\n\"I know your wife,\" continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.\n\n\"That so?\"\n\nTom turned to me.\n\n\"You live near here, Nick?\"\n\n\"Next door.\"\n\n\"That so?\"\n\nMr. Sloane didn't enter into the conversation but lounged back haughtily\nin his chair; the woman said nothing either--until unexpectedly, after\ntwo highballs, she became cordial.\n\n\"We'll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,\" she suggested.\n\"What do you say?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I'd be delighted to have you.\"\n\n\"Be ver' nice,\" said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. \"Well--think ought to\nbe starting home.\"\n\n\"Please don't hurry,\" Gatsby urged them. He had control of himself now\nand he wanted to see more of Tom. \"Why don't you--why don't you stay for\nsupper? I wouldn't be surprised if some other people dropped in from\nNew York.\"\n\n\"You come to supper with ME,\" said the lady enthusiastically.\n\"Both of you.\"\n\nThis included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.\n\n\"Come along,\" he said--but to her only.\n\n\"I mean it,\" she insisted. \"I'd love to have you. Lots of room.\"\n\nGatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn't see\nthat Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn't.\n\n\"I'm afraid I won't be able to,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you come,\" she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.\n\nMr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.\n\n\"We won't be late if we start now,\" she insisted aloud.\n\n\"I haven't got a horse,\" said Gatsby. \"I used to ride in the army but\nI've never bought a horse. I'll have to follow you in my car. Excuse me\nfor just a minute.\"\n\nThe rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began\nan impassioned conversation aside.\n\n\"My God, I believe the man's coming,\" said Tom. \"Doesn't he know she\ndoesn't want him?\"\n\n\"She says she does want him.\"\n\n\"She has a big dinner party and he won't know a soul there.\" He frowned.\n\"I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be\nold-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to\nsuit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.\"\n\nSuddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted\ntheir horses.\n\n\"Come on,\" said Mr. Sloane to Tom, \"we're late. We've got to go.\" And then\nto me: \"Tell him we couldn't wait, will you?\"\n\nTom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod and\nthey trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August\nfoliage just as Gatsby with hat and light overcoat in hand came out\nthe front door.\n\nTom was evidently perturbed at Daisy's running around alone, for on the\nfollowing Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby's party. Perhaps\nhis presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness--it\nstands out in my memory from Gatsby's other parties that summer. There\nwere the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same\nprofusion of champagne, the same many-colored, many-keyed commotion,\nbut I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that\nhadn't been there before. Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it,\ngrown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own\nstandards and its own great figures, second to nothing because it had\nno consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at it again,\nthrough Daisy's eyes. It is invariably saddening to look through new\neyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of\nadjustment.\n\nThey arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among the sparkling\nhundreds Daisy's voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.\n\n\"These things excite me SO,\" she whispered. \"If you want to kiss me\nany time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I'll be glad\nto arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card.\nI'm giving out green----\"\n\n\"Look around,\" suggested Gatsby.\n\n\"I'm looking around. I'm having a marvelous----\"\n\n\"You must see the faces of many people you've heard about.\"\n\nTom's arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.\n\n\"We don't go around very much,\" he said. \"In fact I was just thinking\nI don't know a soul here.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you know that lady.\" Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely human\norchid of a woman who sat in state under a white plum tree. Tom and Daisy\nstared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the\nrecognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.\n\n\"She's lovely,\" said Daisy.\n\n\"The man bending over her is her director.\"\n\nHe took them ceremoniously from group to group:\n\n\"Mrs. Buchanan . . . and Mr. Buchanan----\" After an instant's hesitation\nhe added: \"the polo player.\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" objected Tom quickly, \"Not me.\"\n\nBut evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained \"the polo\nplayer\" for the rest of the evening.\n\n\"I've never met so many celebrities!\" Daisy exclaimed. \"I liked that\nman--what was his name?--with the sort of blue nose.\"\n\nGatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.\n\n\"Well, I liked him anyhow.\"\n\n\"I'd a little rather not be the polo player,\" said Tom pleasantly, \"I'd\nrather look at all these famous people in--in oblivion.\"\n\nDaisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful,\nconservative fox-trot--I had never seen him dance before. Then they\nsauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour while\nat her request I remained watchfully in the garden: \"In case there's a\nfire or a flood,\" she explained, \"or any act of God.\"\n\nTom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together.\n\"Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?\" he said. \"A fellow's\ngetting off some funny stuff.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" answered Daisy genially, \"And if you want to take down any\naddresses here's my little gold pencil. . . .\" She looked around after\na moment and told me the girl was \"common but pretty,\" and I knew that\nexcept for the half hour she'd been alone with Gatsby she wasn't having\na good time.\n\nWe were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault--Gatsby had\nbeen called to the phone and I'd enjoyed these same people only two\nweeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now.\n\n\"How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?\"\n\nThe girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my\nshoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.\n\n\"Wha?\"\n\nA massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf\nwith her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker's defence:\n\n\"Oh, she's all right now. When she's had five or six cocktails she always\nstarts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it alone.\"\n\n\"I do leave it alone,\" affirmed the accused hollowly.\n\n\"We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: 'There's somebody\nthat needs your help, Doc.' \"\n\n\"She's much obliged, I'm sure,\" said another friend, without gratitude.\n\"But you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool.\"\n\n\"Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,\" mumbled Miss\nBaedeker. \"They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.\"\n\n\"Then you ought to leave it alone,\" countered Doctor Civet.\n\n\"Speak for yourself!\" cried Miss Baedeker violently. \"Your hand shakes.\nI wouldn't let you operate on me!\"\n\nIt was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with\nDaisy and watching the moving picture director and his Star. They were\nstill under the white plum tree and their faces were touching except\nfor a pale thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he\nhad been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this\nproximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate degree\nand kiss at her cheek.\n\n\"I like her,\" said Daisy, \"I think she's lovely.\"\n\nBut the rest offended her--and inarguably, because it wasn't a gesture but\nan emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented \"place\"\nthat Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village--appalled\nby its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too\nobtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short cut from nothing\nto nothing. She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed\nto understand.\n\nI sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car. It\nwas dark here in front: only the bright door sent ten square feet of\nlight volleying out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a shadow\nmoved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow,\nan indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an\ninvisible glass.\n\n\"Who is this Gatsby anyhow?\" demanded Tom suddenly. \"Some big bootlegger?\"\n\n\"Where'd you hear that?\" I inquired.\n\n\"I didn't hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are\njust big bootleggers, you know.\"\n\n\"Not Gatsby,\" I said shortly.\n\nHe was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under his\nfeet.\n\n\"Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie\ntogether.\"\n\nA breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy's fur collar.\n\n\"At least they're more interesting than the people we know,\" she said\nwith an effort.\n\n\"You didn't look so interested.\"\n\n\"Well, I was.\"\n\nTom laughed and turned to me.\n\n\"Did you notice Daisy's face when that girl asked her to put her under\na cold shower?\"\n\nDaisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper,\nbringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had\nbefore and would never have again. When the melody rose, her voice\nbroke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and\neach change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.\n\n\"Lots of people come who haven't been invited,\" she said suddenly.\n\"That girl hadn't been invited. They simply force their way in and he's\ntoo polite to object.\"\n\n\"I'd like to know who he is and what he does,\" insisted Tom. \"And I think\nI'll make a point of finding out.\"\n\n\"I can tell you right now,\" she answered. \"He owned some drug stores,\na lot of drug stores. He built them up himself.\"\n\nThe dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.\n\n\"Good night, Nick,\" said Daisy.\n\nHer glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps where\n\"Three o'Clock in the Morning,\" a neat, sad little waltz of that year,\nwas drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of\nGatsby's party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from\nher world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling\nher back inside? What would happen now in the dim incalculable hours?\nPerhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare\nand to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with\none fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would blot\nout those five years of unwavering devotion.\n\n\nI stayed late that night. Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free\nand I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run\nup, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights were\nextinguished in the guest rooms overhead. When he came down the steps at\nlast the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes\nwere bright and tired.\n\n\"She didn't like it,\" he said immediately.\n\n\"Of course she did.\"\n\n\"She didn't like it,\" he insisted. \"She didn't have a good time.\"\n\nHe was silent and I guessed at his unutterable depression.\n\n\"I feel far away from her,\" he said. \"It's hard to make her understand.\"\n\n\"You mean about the dance?\"\n\n\"The dance?\" He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of\nhis fingers. \"Old sport, the dance is unimportant.\"\n\nHe wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say:\n\"I never loved you.\" After she had obliterated three years with that\nsentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken.\nOne of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back to\nLouisville and be married from her house--just as if it were five\nyears ago.\n\n\"And she doesn't understand,\" he said. \"She used to be able to\nunderstand. We'd sit for hours----\"\n\nHe broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds\nand discarded favors and crushed flowers.\n\n\"I wouldn't ask too much of her,\" I ventured. \"You can't repeat the past.\"\n\n\"Can't repeat the past?\" he cried incredulously. \"Why of course you can!\"\n\nHe looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the\nshadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.\n\n\"I'm going to fix everything just the way it was before,\" he said,\nnodding determinedly. \"She'll see.\"\n\nHe talked a lot about the past and I gathered that he wanted to recover\nsomething, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy.\nHis life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could\nonce return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he\ncould find out what that thing was. . . .\n\n. . . One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down\nthe street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where\nthere were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight.\nThey stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night\nwith that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of\nthe year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the\ndarkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the\ncorner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalk really\nformed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees--he could\nclimb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the\npap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.\n\nHis heart beat faster and faster as Daisy's white face came up to his\nown. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his\nunutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp\nagain like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer\nto the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed\nher. At his lips' touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the\nincarnation was complete.\n\nThrough all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was\nreminded of something--an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that\nI had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to\ntake shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man's, as though\nthere was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But\nthey made no sound and what I had almost remembered was\nuncommunicable forever.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\n\n\nIt was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights\nin his house failed to go on one Saturday night--and, as obscurely as it\nhad begun, his career as Trimalchio was over.\n\nOnly gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned\nexpectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove\nsulkily away. Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out--an\nunfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously\nfrom the door.\n\n\"Is Mr. Gatsby sick?\"\n\n\"Nope.\" After a pause he added \"sir\" in a dilatory, grudging way.\n\n\"I hadn't seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr. Carraway\ncame over.\"\n\n\"Who?\" he demanded rudely.\n\n\"Carraway.\"\n\n\"Carraway. All right, I'll tell him.\" Abruptly he slammed the door.\n\nMy Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his\nhouse a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never\nwent into West Egg Village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered\nmoderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that the\nkitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village was\nthat the new people weren't servants at all.\n\nNext day Gatsby called me on the phone.\n\n\"Going away?\" I inquired.\n\n\"No, old sport.\"\n\n\"I hear you fired all your servants.\"\n\n\"I wanted somebody who wouldn't gossip. Daisy comes over quite often--in\nthe afternoons.\"\n\nSo the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the\ndisapproval in her eyes.\n\n\"They're some people Wolfsheim wanted to do something for. They're all\nbrothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nHe was calling up at Daisy's request--would I come to lunch at\nher house tomorrow? Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later\nDaisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was coming.\nSomething was up. And yet I couldn't believe that they would choose\nthis occasion for a scene--especially for the rather harrowing scene\nthat Gatsby had outlined in the garden.\n\nThe next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of\nthe summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the\nhot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush\nat noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion;\nthe woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white\nshirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers,\nlapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry. Her pocket-book\nslapped to the floor.\n\n\"Oh, my!\" she gasped.\n\nI picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it\nat arm's length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that\nI had no designs upon it--but every one near by, including the woman,\nsuspected me just the same.\n\n\"Hot!\" said the conductor to familiar faces. \"Some weather! Hot! Hot! Hot!\nIs it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it . . . ?\"\n\nMy commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand.\nThat any one should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed,\nwhose head made damp the pajama pocket over his heart!\n\n. . . Through the hall of the Buchanans' house blew a faint wind,\ncarrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we\nwaited at the door.\n\n\"The master's body!\" roared the butler into the mouthpiece. \"I'm sorry,\nmadame, but we can't furnish it--it's far too hot to touch this noon!\"\n\nWhat he really said was: \"Yes . . . yes . . . I'll see.\"\n\nHe set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to take\nour stiff straw hats.\n\n\"Madame expects you in the salon!\" he cried, needlessly indicating the\ndirection. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the\ncommon store of life.\n\nThe room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and\nJordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols, weighing down\ntheir own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.\n\n\"We can't move,\" they said together.\n\nJordan's fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in\nmine.\n\n\"And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?\" I inquired.\n\nSimultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall\ntelephone.\n\nGatsby stood in the center of the crimson carpet and gazed around with\nfascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting\nlaugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.\n\n\"The rumor is,\" whispered Jordan, \"that that's Tom's girl on the\ntelephone.\"\n\nWe were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance.\n\"Very well, then, I won't sell you the car at all. . . . I'm\nunder no obligations to you at all. . . . And as for your bothering me\nabout it at lunch time I won't stand that at all!\"\n\n\"Holding down the receiver,\" said Daisy cynically.\n\n\"No, he's not,\" I assured her. \"It's a bona fide deal. I happen to\nknow about it.\"\n\nTom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his\nthick body, and hurried into the room.\n\n\"Mr. Gatsby!\" He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed\ndislike. \"I'm glad to see you, sir. . . . Nick. . . .\"\n\n\"Make us a cold drink,\" cried Daisy.\n\nAs he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled\nhis face down kissing him on the mouth.\n\n\"You know I love you,\" she murmured.\n\n\"You forget there's a lady present,\" said Jordan.\n\nDaisy looked around doubtfully.\n\n\"You kiss Nick too.\"\n\n\"What a low, vulgar girl!\"\n\n\"I don't care!\" cried Daisy and began to clog on the brick fireplace.\nThen she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as\na freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.\n\n\"Bles-sed pre-cious,\" she crooned, holding out her arms. \"Come to your\nown mother that loves you.\"\n\nThe child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and rooted\nshyly into her mother's dress.\n\n\"The Bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy\nhair? Stand up now, and say How-de-do.\"\n\nGatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand.\nAfterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don't think he had\never really believed in its existence before.\n\n\"I got dressed before luncheon,\" said the child, turning eagerly to\nDaisy.\n\n\"That's because your mother wanted to show you off.\" Her face bent into\nthe single wrinkle of the small white neck. \"You dream, you. You absolute\nlittle dream.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" admitted the child calmly. \"Aunt Jordan's got on a white\ndress too.\"\n\n\"How do you like mother's friends?\" Daisy turned her around so that she\nfaced Gatsby. \"Do you think they're pretty?\"\n\n\"Where's Daddy?\"\n\n\"She doesn't look like her father,\" explained Daisy. \"She looks like me.\nShe's got my hair and shape of the face.\"\n\nDaisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held\nout her hand.\n\n\"Come, Pammy.\"\n\n\"Goodbye, sweetheart!\"\n\nWith a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her\nnurse's hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back,\npreceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.\n\nGatsby took up his drink.\n\n\"They certainly look cool,\" he said, with visible tension.\n\nWe drank in long greedy swallows.\n\n\"I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter every year,\" said Tom\ngenially. \"It seems that pretty soon the earth's going to fall into the\nsun--or wait a minute--it's just the opposite--the sun's getting colder\nevery year.\n\n\"Come outside,\" he suggested to Gatsby, \"I'd like you to have a look at\nthe place.\"\n\nI went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in the\nheat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea. Gatsby's eyes\nfollowed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay.\n\n\"I'm right across from you.\"\n\n\"So you are.\"\n\nOur eyes lifted over the rosebeds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse\nof the dog days along shore. Slowly the white wings of the boat moved\nagainst the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and\nthe abounding blessed isles.\n\n\"There's sport for you,\" said Tom, nodding. \"I'd like to be out there\nwith him for about an hour.\"\n\nWe had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened, too, against the heat,\nand drank down nervous gayety with the cold ale.\n\n\"What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon,\" cried Daisy, \"and the\nday after that, and the next thirty years?\"\n\n\"Don't be morbid,\" Jordan said. \"Life starts all over again when it gets\ncrisp in the fall.\"\n\n\"But it's so hot,\" insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, \"And\neverything's so confused. Let's all go to town!\"\n\nHer voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding its\nsenselessness into forms.\n\n\"I've heard of making a garage out of a stable,\" Tom was saying to\nGatsby, \"but I'm the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.\"\n\n\"Who wants to go to town?\" demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby's eyes\nfloated toward her. \"Ah,\" she cried, \"you look so cool.\"\n\nTheir eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space.\nWith an effort she glanced down at the table.\n\n\"You always look so cool,\" she repeated.\n\nShe had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was\nastounded. His mouth opened a little and he looked at Gatsby and then\nback at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as some one he knew a\nlong time ago.\n\n\"You resemble the advertisement of the man,\" she went on innocently.\n\"You know the advertisement of the man----\"\n\n\"All right,\" broke in Tom quickly, \"I'm perfectly willing to go to\ntown. Come on--we're all going to town.\"\n\nHe got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife.\nNo one moved.\n\n\"Come on!\" His temper cracked a little. \"What's the matter, anyhow?\nIf we're going to town let's start.\"\n\nHis hand, trembling with his effort at self control, bore to his lips the\nlast of his glass of ale. Daisy's voice got us to our feet and out on\nto the blazing gravel drive.\n\n\"Are we just going to go?\" she objected. \"Like this? Aren't we going to\nlet any one smoke a cigarette first?\"\n\n\"Everybody smoked all through lunch.\"\n\n\"Oh, let's have fun,\" she begged him. \"It's too hot to fuss.\"\n\nHe didn't answer.\n\n\"Have it your own way,\" she said. \"Come on, Jordan.\"\n\nThey went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling\nthe hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon hovered already\nin the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not\nbefore Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.\n\n\"Have you got your stables here?\" asked Gatsby with an effort.\n\n\"About a quarter of a mile down the road.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"I don't see the idea of going to town,\" broke out Tom savagely.\n\"Women get these notions in their heads----\"\n\n\"Shall we take anything to drink?\" called Daisy from an upper window.\n\n\"I'll get some whiskey,\" answered Tom. He went inside.\n\nGatsby turned to me rigidly:\n\n\"I can't say anything in his house, old sport.\"\n\n\"She's got an indiscreet voice,\" I remarked. \"It's full of----\"\n\nI hesitated.\n\n\"Her voice is full of money,\" he said suddenly.\n\nThat was it. I'd never understood before. It was full of money--that was\nthe inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the\ncymbals' song of it. . . . High in a white palace the king's daughter,\nthe golden girl. . . .\n\nTom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed\nby Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and\ncarrying light capes over their arms.\n\n\"Shall we all go in my car?\" suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green\nleather of the seat. \"I ought to have left it in the shade.\"\n\n\"Is it standard shift?\" demanded Tom.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, you take my coup\u00e9 and let me drive your car to town.\"\n\nThe suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.\n\n\"I don't think there's much gas,\" he objected.\n\n\"Plenty of gas,\" said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge.\n\"And if it runs out I can stop at a drug store. You can buy anything at a\ndrug store nowadays.\"\n\nA pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom\nfrowning and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar\nand vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in words,\npassed over Gatsby's face.\n\n\"Come on, Daisy,\" said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby's\ncar. \"I'll take you in this circus wagon.\"\n\nHe opened the door but she moved out from the circle of his arm.\n\n\"You take Nick and Jordan. We'll follow you in the coup\u00e9.\"\n\nShe walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan and\nTom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby's car, Tom pushed the\nunfamiliar gears tentatively and we shot off into the oppressive heat\nleaving them out of sight behind.\n\n\"Did you see that?\" demanded Tom.\n\n\"See what?\"\n\nHe looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known all\nalong.\n\n\"You think I'm pretty dumb, don't you?\" he suggested. \"Perhaps I am, but\nI have a--almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do.\nMaybe you don't believe that, but science----\"\n\nHe paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back from\nthe edge of the theoretical abyss.\n\n\"I've made a small investigation of this fellow,\" he continued. \"I could\nhave gone deeper if I'd known----\"\n\n\"Do you mean you've been to a medium?\" inquired Jordan humorously.\n\n\"What?\" Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. \"A medium?\"\n\n\"About Gatsby.\"\n\n\"About Gatsby! No, I haven't. I said I'd been making a small\ninvestigation of his past.\"\n\n\"And you found he was an Oxford man,\" said Jordan helpfully.\n\n\"An Oxford man!\" He was incredulous. \"Like hell he is! He wears a\npink suit.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless he's an Oxford man.\"\n\n\"Oxford, New Mexico,\" snorted Tom contemptuously, \"or something like\nthat.\"\n\n\"Listen, Tom. If you're such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?\"\ndemanded Jordan crossly.\n\n\"Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married--God knows\nwhere!\"\n\nWe were all irritable now with the fading ale and, aware of it,\nwe drove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg's faded\neyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby's caution about\ngasoline.\n\n\"We've got enough to get us to town,\" said Tom.\n\n\"But there's a garage right here,\" objected Jordan. \"I don't want to get\nstalled in this baking heat.\"\n\nTom threw on both brakes impatiently and we slid to an abrupt\ndusty stop under Wilson's sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged\nfrom the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.\n\n\"Let's have some gas!\" cried Tom roughly. \"What do you think we stopped\nfor--to admire the view?\"\n\n\"I'm sick,\" said Wilson without moving. \"I been sick all day.\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"I'm all run down.\"\n\n\"Well, shall I help myself?\" Tom demanded. \"You sounded well enough\non the phone.\"\n\nWith an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and,\nbreathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his face\nwas green.\n\n\"I didn't mean to interrupt your lunch,\" he said. \"But I need money\npretty bad and I was wondering what you were going to do with your\nold car.\"\n\n\"How do you like this one?\" inquired Tom. \"I bought it last week.\"\n\n\"It's a nice yellow one,\" said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.\n\n\"Like to buy it?\"\n\n\"Big chance,\" Wilson smiled faintly. \"No, but I could make some money\non the other.\"\n\n\"What do you want money for, all of a sudden?\"\n\n\"I've been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to\ngo west.\"\n\n\"Your wife does!\" exclaimed Tom, startled.\n\n\"She's been talking about it for ten years.\" He rested for a moment\nagainst the pump, shading his eyes. \"And now she's going whether she wants\nto or not. I'm going to get her away.\"\n\nThe coup\u00e9 flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a\nwaving hand.\n\n\"What do I owe you?\" demanded Tom harshly.\n\n\"I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,\" remarked\nWilson. \"That's why I want to get away. That's why I been bothering you\nabout the car.\"\n\n\"What do I owe you?\"\n\n\"Dollar twenty.\"\n\nThe relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had\na bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions\nhadn't alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some\nsort of life apart from him in another world and the shock had\nmade him physically sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made\na parallel discovery less than an hour before--and it occurred to me\nthat there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so\nprofound as the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so\nsick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty--as if he had just got\nsome poor girl with child.\n\n\"I'll let you have that car,\" said Tom. \"I'll send it over tomorrow\nafternoon.\"\n\nThat locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad\nglare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been\nwarned of something behind. Over the ashheaps the giant eyes of\nDoctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil but I perceived, after\na moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity\nfrom less than twenty feet away.\n\nIn one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside\na little and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So engrossed\nwas she that she had no consciousness of being observed and one\nemotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly\ndeveloping picture. Her expression was curiously familiar--it was an\nexpression I had often seen on women's faces but on Myrtle Wilson's\nface it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her\neyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan\nBaker, whom she took to be his wife.\n\n\nThere is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we\ndrove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his\nmistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping\nprecipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the\naccelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving\nWilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour,\nuntil, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of\nthe easygoing blue coup\u00e9.\n\n\"Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,\" suggested Jordan.\n\"I love New York on summer afternoons when every one's away. There's\nsomething very sensuous about it--overripe, as if all sorts of funny\nfruits were going to fall into your hands.\"\n\nThe word \"sensuous\" had the effect of further disquieting Tom but before\nhe could invent a protest the coup\u00e9 came to a stop and Daisy signalled us\nto draw up alongside.\n\n\"Where are we going?\" she cried.\n\n\"How about the movies?\"\n\n\"It's so hot,\" she complained. \"You go. We'll ride around and meet you\nafter.\" With an effort her wit rose faintly, \"We'll meet you on some\ncorner. I'll be the man smoking two cigarettes.\"\n\n\"We can't argue about it here,\" Tom said impatiently as a truck gave\nout a cursing whistle behind us. \"You follow me to the south side of\nCentral Park, in front of the Plaza.\"\n\nSeveral times he turned his head and looked back for their car,\nand if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into\nsight. I think he was afraid they would dart down a side street and out\nof his life forever.\n\nBut they didn't. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging\nthe parlor of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.\n\nThe prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into\nthat room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the\ncourse of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my\nlegs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back. The\nnotion originated with Daisy's suggestion that we hire five bathrooms\nand take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as \"a place to\nhave a mint julep.\" Each of us said over and over that it was a \"crazy\nidea\"--we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or\npretended to think, that we were being very funny. . . .\n\nThe room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four\no'clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from\nthe Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us,\nfixing her hair.\n\n\"It's a swell suite,\" whispered Jordan respectfully and every one\nlaughed.\n\n\"Open another window,\" commanded Daisy, without turning around.\n\n\"There aren't any more.\"\n\n\"Well, we'd better telephone for an axe----\"\n\n\"The thing to do is to forget about the heat,\" said Tom impatiently.\n\"You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.\"\n\nHe unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the towel and put it on the table.\n\n\"Why not let her alone, old sport?\" remarked Gatsby. \"You're the one that\nwanted to come to town.\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its nail\nand splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered \"Excuse me\"--but\nthis time no one laughed.\n\n\"I'll pick it up,\" I offered.\n\n\"I've got it.\" Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered \"Hum!\" in an\ninterested way, and tossed the book on a chair.\n\n\"That's a great expression of yours, isn't it?\" said Tom sharply.\n\n\"What is?\"\n\n\"All this 'old sport' business. Where'd you pick that up?\"\n\n\"Now see here, Tom,\" said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, \"if\nyou're going to make personal remarks I won't stay here a minute. Call\nup and order some ice for the mint julep.\"\n\nAs Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and\nwe were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn's Wedding March\nfrom the ballroom below.\n\n\"Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!\" cried Jordan dismally.\n\n\"Still--I was married in the middle of June,\" Daisy remembered,\n\"Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?\"\n\n\"Biloxi,\" he answered shortly.\n\n\"A man named Biloxi. 'Blocks' Biloxi, and he made boxes--that's a\nfact--and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.\"\n\n\"They carried him into my house,\" appended Jordan, \"because we lived\njust two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy\ntold him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died.\" After a\nmoment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, \"There\nwasn't any connection.\"\n\n\"I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,\" I remarked.\n\n\"That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left.\nHe gave me an aluminum putter that I use today.\"\n\nThe music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated\nin at the window, followed by intermittent cries of \"Yea--ea--ea!\"\nand finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.\n\n\"We're getting old,\" said Daisy. \"If we were young we'd rise and dance.\"\n\n\"Remember Biloxi,\" Jordan warned her. \"Where'd you know him, Tom?\"\n\n\"Biloxi?\" He concentrated with an effort. \"I didn't know him. He was a\nfriend of Daisy's.\"\n\n\"He was not,\" she denied. \"I'd never seen him before. He came down in\nthe private car.\"\n\n\"Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville.\nAsa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room\nfor him.\"\n\nJordan smiled.\n\n\"He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of\nyour class at Yale.\"\n\nTom and I looked at each other blankly.\n\n\"BilOxi?\"\n\n\"First place, we didn't have any president----\"\n\nGatsby's foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.\n\n\"By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you're an Oxford man.\"\n\n\"Not exactly.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.\"\n\n\"Yes--I went there.\"\n\nA pause. Then Tom's voice, incredulous and insulting:\n\n\"You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.\"\n\nAnother pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but\nthe silence was unbroken by his \"Thank you\" and the soft closing of the\ndoor. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.\n\n\"I told you I went there,\" said Gatsby.\n\n\"I heard you, but I'd like to know when.\"\n\n\"It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That's why I\ncan't really call myself an Oxford man.\"\n\nTom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all\nlooking at Gatsby.\n\n\"It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the\nArmistice,\" he continued. \"We could go to any of the universities in\nEngland or France.\"\n\nI wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those renewals\nof complete faith in him that I'd experienced before.\n\nDaisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.\n\n\"Open the whiskey, Tom,\" she ordered. \"And I'll make you a mint julep.\nThen you won't seem so stupid to yourself. . . . Look at the mint!\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" snapped Tom, \"I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more\nquestion.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" Gatsby said politely.\n\n\"What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?\"\n\nThey were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.\n\n\"He isn't causing a row.\" Daisy looked desperately from one to the\nother. \"You're causing a row. Please have a little self control.\"\n\n\"Self control!\" repeated Tom incredulously. \"I suppose the latest thing\nis to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife.\nWell, if that's the idea you can count me out. . . . Nowadays people begin\nby sneering at family life and family institutions and next they'll\nthrow everything overboard and have intermarriage between black\nand white.\"\n\nFlushed with his impassioned gibberish he saw himself standing alone on\nthe last barrier of civilization.\n\n\"We're all white here,\" murmured Jordan.\n\n\"I know I'm not very popular. I don't give big parties. I suppose\nyou've got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any\nfriends--in the modern world.\"\n\nAngry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened\nhis mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so complete.\n\n\"I've got something to tell YOU, old sport,----\" began Gatsby. But Daisy\nguessed at his intention.\n\n\"Please don't!\" she interrupted helplessly. \"Please let's all go home.\nWhy don't we all go home?\"\n\n\"That's a good idea.\" I got up. \"Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.\"\n\n\"I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.\"\n\n\"Your wife doesn't love you,\" said Gatsby. \"She's never loved you.\nShe loves me.\"\n\n\"You must be crazy!\" exclaimed Tom automatically.\n\nGatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.\n\n\"She never loved you, do you hear?\" he cried. \"She only married you\nbecause I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible\nmistake, but in her heart she never loved any one except me!\"\n\nAt this point Jordan and I tried to go but Tom and Gatsby insisted with\ncompetitive firmness that we remain--as though neither of them had\nanything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously\nof their emotions.\n\n\"Sit down Daisy.\" Tom's voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal\nnote. \"What's been going on? I want to hear all about it.\"\n\n\"I told you what's been going on,\" said Gatsby. \"Going on for five\nyears--and you didn't know.\"\n\nTom turned to Daisy sharply.\n\n\"You've been seeing this fellow for five years?\"\n\n\"Not seeing,\" said Gatsby. \"No, we couldn't meet. But both of us loved\neach other all that time, old sport, and you didn't know. I used to laugh\nsometimes--\"but there was no laughter in his eyes, \"to think that you\ndidn't know.\"\n\n\"Oh--that's all.\" Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman\nand leaned back in his chair.\n\n\"You're crazy!\" he exploded. \"I can't speak about what happened five years\nago, because I didn't know Daisy then--and I'll be damned if I see how you\ngot within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back\ndoor. But all the rest of that's a God Damned lie. Daisy loved me when\nshe married me and she loves me now.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Gatsby, shaking his head.\n\n\"She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas\nin her head and doesn't know what she's doing.\" He nodded sagely. \"And\nwhat's more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree\nand make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I\nlove her all the time.\"\n\n\"You're revolting,\" said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice,\ndropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: \"Do you\nknow why we left Chicago? I'm surprised that they didn't treat you to\nthe story of that little spree.\"\n\nGatsby walked over and stood beside her.\n\n\"Daisy, that's all over now,\" he said earnestly. \"It doesn't matter any\nmore. Just tell him the truth--that you never loved him--and it's all\nwiped out forever.\"\n\nShe looked at him blindly. \"Why,--how could I love him--possibly?\"\n\n\"You never loved him.\"\n\nShe hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal,\nas though she realized at last what she was doing--and as though she had\nnever, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done now.\nIt was too late.\n\n\"I never loved him,\" she said, with perceptible reluctance.\n\n\"Not at Kapiolani?\" demanded Tom suddenly.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nFrom the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up\non hot waves of air.\n\n\"Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes\ndry?\" There was a husky tenderness in his tone. \". . . Daisy?\"\n\n\"Please don't.\" Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it.\nShe looked at Gatsby. \"There, Jay,\" she said--but her hand as she tried\nto light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette and\nthe burning match on the carpet.\n\n\"Oh, you want too much!\" she cried to Gatsby. \"I love you now--isn't that\nenough? I can't help what's past.\" She began to sob helplessly.\n\"I did love him once--but I loved you too.\"\n\nGatsby's eyes opened and closed.\n\n\"You loved me TOO?\" he repeated.\n\n\"Even that's a lie,\" said Tom savagely. \"She didn't know you were alive.\nWhy,--there're things between Daisy and me that you'll never know,\nthings that neither of us can ever forget.\"\n\nThe words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.\n\n\"I want to speak to Daisy alone,\" he insisted. \"She's all excited now----\"\n\n\"Even alone I can't say I never loved Tom,\" she admitted in a pitiful\nvoice. \"It wouldn't be true.\"\n\n\"Of course it wouldn't,\" agreed Tom.\n\nShe turned to her husband.\n\n\"As if it mattered to you,\" she said.\n\n\"Of course it matters. I'm going to take better care of you from now on.\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. \"You're not\ngoing to take care of her any more.\"\n\n\"I'm not?\" Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to\ncontrol himself now. \"Why's that?\"\n\n\"Daisy's leaving you.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\n\"I am, though,\" she said with a visible effort.\n\n\"She's not leaving me!\" Tom's words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby.\n\"Certainly not for a common swindler who'd have to steal the ring he\nput on her finger.\"\n\n\"I won't stand this!\" cried Daisy. \"Oh, please let's get out.\"\n\n\"Who are you, anyhow?\" broke out Tom. \"You're one of that bunch that\nhangs around with Meyer Wolfsheim--that much I happen to know. I've made\na little investigation into your affairs--and I'll carry it further\ntomorrow.\"\n\n\"You can suit yourself about that, old sport.\" said Gatsby steadily.\n\n\"I found out what your 'drug stores' were.\" He turned to us and spoke\nrapidly. \"He and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of side-street drug stores\nhere and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. That's one of\nhis little stunts. I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw\nhim and I wasn't far wrong.\"\n\n\"What about it?\" said Gatsby politely. \"I guess your friend Walter Chase\nwasn't too proud to come in on it.\"\n\n\"And you left him in the lurch, didn't you? You let him go to jail for\na month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the subject\nof YOU.\"\n\n\"He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old\nsport.\"\n\n\"Don't you call me 'old sport'!\" cried Tom. Gatsby said nothing.\n\"Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfsheim scared\nhim into shutting his mouth.\"\n\nThat unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby's face.\n\n\"That drug store business was just small change,\" continued Tom slowly,\n\"but you've got something on now that Walter's afraid to tell me\nabout.\"\n\nI glanced at Daisy who was staring terrified between Gatsby\nand her husband and at Jordan who had begun to balance an invisible\nbut absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to\nGatsby--and was startled at his expression. He looked--and this is said\nin all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden--as if he had\n\"killed a man.\" For a moment the set of his face could be described in\njust that fantastic way.\n\nIt passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything,\ndefending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with\nevery word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave\nthat up and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped\naway, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling\nunhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.\n\nThe voice begged again to go.\n\n\"PLEASE, Tom! I can't stand this any more.\"\n\nHer frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage\nshe had had, were definitely gone.\n\n\"You two start on home, Daisy,\" said Tom. \"In Mr. Gatsby's car.\"\n\nShe looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous scorn.\n\n\"Go on. He won't annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous\nlittle flirtation is over.\"\n\nThey were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental, isolated,\nlike ghosts even from our pity.\n\nAfter a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of\nwhiskey in the towel.\n\n\"Want any of this stuff? Jordan? . . . Nick?\"\n\nI didn't answer.\n\n\"Nick?\" He asked again.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Want any?\"\n\n\"No . . . I just remembered that today's my birthday.\"\n\nI was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous menacing road of a\nnew decade.\n\nIt was seven o'clock when we got into the coup\u00e9 with him and started\nfor Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but his\nvoice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamor on the\nsidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead. Human sympathy\nhas its limits and we were content to let all their tragic arguments\nfade with the city lights behind. Thirty--the promise of a decade\nof loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning\nbrief-case of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside\nme who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten\ndreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face\nfell lazily against my coat's shoulder and the formidable stroke of\nthirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.\n\nSo we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.\n\n\nThe young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the\nashheaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had slept through\nthe heat until after five, when he strolled over to the garage and\nfound George Wilson sick in his office--really sick, pale as his own\npale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go to bed but\nWilson refused, saying that he'd miss a lot of business if he did.\nWhile his neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke\nout overhead.\n\n\"I've got my wife locked in up there,\" explained Wilson calmly.\n\"She's going to stay there till the day after tomorrow and then we're\ngoing to move away.\"\n\nMichaelis was astonished; they had been neighbors for four years and\nWilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement. Generally\nhe was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn't working he sat on a\nchair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed\nalong the road. When any one spoke to him he invariably laughed in an\nagreeable, colorless way. He was his wife's man and not his own.\n\nSo naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson\nwouldn't say a word--instead he began to throw curious, suspicious\nglances at his visitor and ask him what he'd been doing at certain\ntimes on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy some\nworkmen came past the door bound for his restaurant and Michaelis took\nthe opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he didn't.\nHe supposed he forgot to, that's all. When he came outside again\na little after seven he was reminded of the conversation because he\nheard Mrs. Wilson's voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in the garage.\n\n\"Beat me!\" he heard her cry. \"Throw me down and beat me, you dirty\nlittle coward!\"\n\nA moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and\nshouting; before he could move from his door the business was over.\n\nThe \"death car\" as the newspapers called it, didn't stop; it came out\nof the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment and then\ndisappeared around the next bend. Michaelis wasn't even sure of its\ncolor--he told the first policeman that it was light green. The other\ncar, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards\nbeyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life\nviolently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick, dark\nblood with the dust.\n\nMichaelis and this man reached her first but when they had torn open\nher shirtwaist still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left\nbreast was swinging loose like a flap and there was no need to listen\nfor the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped at the\ncorners as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous\nvitality she had stored so long.\n\n\nWe saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still\nsome distance away.\n\n\"Wreck!\" said Tom. \"That's good. Wilson'll have a little business\nat last.\"\n\nHe slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping until,\nas we came nearer, the hushed intent faces of the people at the garage\ndoor made him automatically put on the brakes.\n\n\"We'll take a look,\" he said doubtfully, \"just a look.\"\n\nI became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly\nfrom the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coup\u00e9 and walked\ntoward the door resolved itself into the words \"Oh, my God!\" uttered over\nand over in a gasping moan.\n\n\"There's some bad trouble here,\" said Tom excitedly.\n\nHe reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the\ngarage which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging wire basket\noverhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat and with a violent\nthrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through.\n\nThe circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it\nwas a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals\ndisarranged the line and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.\n\nMyrtle Wilson's body wrapped in a blanket and then in another\nblanket as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night lay on a\nwork table by the wall and Tom, with his back to us, was bending over\nit, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down\nnames with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I\ncouldn't find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed\nclamorously through the bare garage--then I saw Wilson standing on the\nraised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to\nthe doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low\nvoice and attempting from time to time to lay a hand on his shoulder,\nbut Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly from the\nswinging light to the laden table by the wall and then jerk back to\nthe light again and he gave out incessantly his high horrible call.\n\n\"O, my Ga-od! O, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!\"\n\nPresently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and after staring around the\ngarage with glazed eyes addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the\npoliceman.\n\n\"M-a-v--\" the policeman was saying, \"--o----\"\n\n\"No,--r--\" corrected the man, \"M-a-v-r-o----\"\n\n\"Listen to me!\" muttered Tom fiercely.\n\n\"r--\" said the policeman, \"o----\"\n\n\"g----\"\n\n\"g--\" He looked up as Tom's broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder.\n\"What you want, fella?\"\n\n\"What happened--that's what I want to know!\"\n\n\"Auto hit her. Ins'antly killed.\"\n\n\"Instantly killed,\" repeated Tom, staring.\n\n\"She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn't even stopus car.\"\n\n\"There was two cars,\" said Michaelis, \"one comin', one goin', see?\"\n\n\"Going where?\" asked the policeman keenly.\n\n\"One goin' each way. Well, she--\" His hand rose toward the blankets but\nstopped half way and fell to his side, \"--she ran out there an' the one\ncomin' from N'York knock right into her goin' thirty or forty miles an\nhour.\"\n\n\"What's the name of this place here?\" demanded the officer.\n\n\"Hasn't got any name.\"\n\nA pale, well-dressed Negro stepped near.\n\n\"It was a yellow car,\" he said, \"big yellow car. New.\"\n\n\"See the accident?\" asked the policeman.\n\n\"No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster'n forty. Going\nfifty, sixty.\"\n\n\"Come here and let's have your name. Look out now. I want to get his\nname.\"\n\nSome words of this conversation must have reached Wilson swaying\nin the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among\nhis gasping cries.\n\n\"You don't have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of\ncar it was!\"\n\nWatching Tom I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten\nunder his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and standing\nin front of him seized him firmly by the upper arms.\n\n\"You've got to pull yourself together,\" he said with soothing\ngruffness.\n\nWilson's eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then\nwould have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.\n\n\"Listen,\" said Tom, shaking him a little. \"I just got here a minute ago,\nfrom New York. I was bringing you that coup\u00e9 we've been talking about.\nThat yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn't mine, do you hear? I\nhaven't seen it all afternoon.\"\n\nOnly the Negro and I were near enough to hear what he said but the\npoliceman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent\neyes.\n\n\"What's all that?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I'm a friend of his.\" Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on\nWilson's body. \"He says he knows the car that did it. . . . It was a yellow\ncar.\"\n\nSome dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.\n\n\"And what color's your car?\"\n\n\"It's a blue car, a coup\u00e9.\"\n\n\"We've come straight from New York,\" I said.\n\nSome one who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this and\nthe policeman turned away.\n\n\"Now, if you'll let me have that name again correct----\"\n\nPicking up Wilson like a doll Tom carried him into the office,\nset him down in a chair and came back.\n\n\"If somebody'll come here and sit with him!\" he snapped\nauthoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced\nat each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the\ndoor on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the\ntable. As he passed close to me he whispered \"Let's get out.\"\n\nSelf consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we\npushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor,\ncase in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.\n\nTom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend--then his foot came down\nhard and the coup\u00e9 raced along through the night. In a little while I\nheard a low husky sob and saw that the tears were overflowing down his\nface.\n\n\"The God Damn coward!\" he whimpered. \"He didn't even stop his car.\"\n\n\nThe Buchanans' house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling\ntrees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor\nwhere two windows bloomed with light among the vines.\n\n\"Daisy's home,\" he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and\nfrowned slightly.\n\n\"I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There's nothing we can\ndo tonight.\"\n\nA change had come over him and he spoke gravely, and with decision.\nAs we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of\nthe situation in a few brisk phrases.\n\n\"I'll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you're waiting\nyou and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some\nsupper--if you want any.\" He opened the door. \"Come in.\"\n\n\"No thanks. But I'd be glad if you'd order me the taxi. I'll wait\noutside.\"\n\nJordan put her hand on my arm.\n\n\"Won't you come in, Nick?\"\n\n\"No thanks.\"\n\nI was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan lingered\nfor a moment more.\n\n\"It's only half past nine,\" she said.\n\nI'd be damned if I'd go in; I'd had enough of all of them for one day\nand suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of\nthis in my expression for she turned abruptly away and ran up the\nporch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head\nin my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler's\nvoice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the\nhouse intending to wait by the gate.\n\nI hadn't gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from\nbetween two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird by that\ntime because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his\npink suit under the moon.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Just standing here, old sport.\"\n\nSomehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was going\nto rob the house in a moment; I wouldn't have been surprised to see\nsinister faces, the faces of \"Wolfsheim's people,\" behind him in the\ndark shrubbery.\n\n\"Did you see any trouble on the road?\" he asked after a minute.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe hesitated.\n\n\"Was she killed?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It's better that the shock\nshould all come at once. She stood it pretty well.\"\n\nHe spoke as if Daisy's reaction was the only thing that mattered.\n\n\"I got to West Egg by a side road,\" he went on, \"and left the car in my\ngarage. I don't think anybody saw us but of course I can't be sure.\"\n\nI disliked him so much by this time that I didn't find it necessary to\ntell him he was wrong.\n\n\"Who was the woman?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it\nhappen?\"\n\n\"Well, I tried to swing the wheel----\" He broke off, and suddenly I\nguessed at the truth.\n\n\"Was Daisy driving?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said after a moment, \"but of course I'll say I was. You see,\nwhen we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would\nsteady her to drive--and this woman rushed out at us just as we were\npassing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute but it\nseemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody\nshe knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other\ncar, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second my hand\nreached the wheel I felt the shock--it must have killed her instantly.\"\n\n\"It ripped her open----\"\n\n\"Don't tell me, old sport.\" He winced. \"Anyhow--Daisy stepped on it.\nI tried to make her stop, but she couldn't so I pulled on the emergency\nbrake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.\n\n\"She'll be all right tomorrow,\" he said presently. \"I'm just going to\nwait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness\nthis afternoon. She's locked herself into her room and if he tries any\nbrutality she's going to turn the light out and on again.\"\n\n\"He won't touch her,\" I said. \"He's not thinking about her.\"\n\n\"I don't trust him, old sport.\"\n\n\"How long are you going to wait?\"\n\n\"All night if necessary. Anyhow till they all go to bed.\"\n\nA new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had\nbeen driving. He might think he saw a connection in it--he might think\nanything. I looked at the house: there were two or three bright windows\ndownstairs and the pink glow from Daisy's room on the second floor.\n\n\"You wait here,\" I said. \"I'll see if there's any sign of a commotion.\"\n\nI walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly\nand tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains were open,\nand I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where we had dined\nthat June night three months before I came to a small rectangle of light\nwhich I guessed was the pantry window. The blind was drawn but I found\na rift at the sill.\n\nDaisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table\nwith a plate of cold fried chicken between them and two bottles of\nale. He was talking intently across the table at her and in his\nearnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a\nwhile she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.\n\nThey weren't happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the\nale--and yet they weren't unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air\nof natural intimacy about the picture and anybody would have said that\nthey were conspiring together.\n\nAs I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the\ndark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in\nthe drive.\n\n\"Is it all quiet up there?\" he asked anxiously.\n\n\"Yes, it's all quiet.\" I hesitated. \"You'd better come home and get\nsome sleep.\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.\"\n\nHe put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his\nscrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of\nthe vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the\nmoonlight--watching over nothing.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\n\n\nI couldn't sleep all night; a fog-horn was groaning incessantly on the\nSound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage\nfrightening dreams. Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby's drive\nand immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress--I felt that I\nhad something to tell him, something to warn him about and morning\nwould be too late.\n\nCrossing his lawn I saw that his front door was still open and he was\nleaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.\n\n\"Nothing happened,\" he said wanly. \"I waited, and about four o'clock she\ncame to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out\nthe light.\"\n\nHis house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we\nhunted through the great rooms for cigarettes. We pushed aside curtains\nthat were like pavilions and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for\nelectric light switches--once I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the\nkeys of a ghostly piano. There was an inexplicable amount of dust\neverywhere and the rooms were musty as though they hadn't been aired for\nmany days. I found the humidor on an unfamiliar table with two stale dry\ncigarettes inside. Throwing open the French windows of the\ndrawing-room we sat smoking out into the darkness.\n\n\"You ought to go away,\" I said. \"It's pretty certain they'll trace\nyour car.\"\n\n\"Go away NOW, old sport?\"\n\n\"Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal.\"\n\nHe wouldn't consider it. He couldn't possibly leave Daisy until he knew\nwhat she was going to do. He was clutching at some last hope and I\ncouldn't bear to shake him free.\n\nIt was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with\nDan Cody--told it to me because \"Jay Gatsby\" had broken up like glass\nagainst Tom's hard malice and the long secret extravaganza was played\nout. I think that he would have acknowledged anything, now, without\nreserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.\n\nShe was the first \"nice\" girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed\ncapacities he had come in contact with such people but always\nwith indiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly\ndesirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers\nfrom Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him--he had never been\nin such a beautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless\nintensity was that Daisy lived there--it was as casual a thing to her\nas his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it,\na hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other\nbedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its\ncorridors and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in\nlavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year's shining\nmotor cars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered. It\nexcited him too that many men had already loved Daisy--it increased\nher value in his eyes. He felt their presence all about the house,\npervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.\n\nBut he knew that he was in Daisy's house by a colossal accident.\nHowever glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a\npenniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible\ncloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he made\nthe most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and\nunscrupulously--eventually he took Daisy one still October night,\ntook her because he had no real right to touch her hand.\n\nHe might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under\nfalse pretenses. I don't mean that he had traded on his phantom\nmillions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he\nlet her believe that he was a person from much the same stratum as\nherself--that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of\nfact he had no such facilities--he had no comfortable family standing\nbehind him and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government\nto be blown anywhere about the world.\n\nBut he didn't despise himself and it didn't turn out as he had\nimagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go--but\nnow he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail.\nHe knew that Daisy was extraordinary but he didn't realize just how\nextraordinary a \"nice\" girl could be. She vanished into her rich\nhouse, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby--nothing. He felt\nmarried to her, that was all.\n\nWhen they met again two days later it was Gatsby who was breathless,\nwho was somehow betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought\nluxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably\nas she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth.\nShe had caught a cold and it made her voice huskier and more charming\nthan ever and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery\nthat wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes\nand of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot\nstruggles of the poor.\n\n\n\"I can't describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her,\nold sport. I even hoped for a while that she'd throw me over, but she\ndidn't, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot\nbecause I knew different things from her. . . . Well, there I was,\nway off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and\nall of a sudden I didn't care. What was the use of doing great\nthings if I could have a better time telling her what I was going\nto do?\"\n\nOn the last afternoon before he went abroad he sat with Daisy in\nhis arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day with fire\nin the room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he\nchanged his arm a little and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The\nafternoon had made them tranquil for a while as if to give them a deep\nmemory for the long parting the next day promised. They had never been\ncloser in their month of love nor communicated more profoundly one\nwith another than when she brushed silent lips against his coat's\nshoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though\nshe were asleep.\n\n\nHe did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before he went\nto the front and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and\nthe command of the divisional machine guns. After the Armistice\nhe tried frantically to get home but some complication or\nmisunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now--there\nwas a quality of nervous despair in Daisy's letters. She didn't see why\nhe couldn't come. She was feeling the pressure of the world outside\nand she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be\nreassured that she was doing the right thing after all.\n\nFor Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids\nand pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of\nthe year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new\ntunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the\n\"Beale Street Blues\" while a hundred pairs of golden and silver\nslippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were\nalways rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low sweet fever,\nwhile fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the\nsad horns around the floor.\n\nThrough this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the\nseason; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with\nhalf a dozen men and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and\nchiffon of an evening dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor\nbeside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a\ndecision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately--and the decision\nmust be made by some force--of love, of money, of unquestionable\npracticality--that was close at hand.\n\nThat force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom\nBuchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his\nposition and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certain\nstruggle and a certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby while he was\nstill at Oxford.\n\n\nIt was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of\nthe windows downstairs, filling the house with grey turning,\ngold turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew\nand ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a\nslow pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool\nlovely day.\n\n\"I don't think she ever loved him.\" Gatsby turned around from a window\nand looked at me challengingly. \"You must remember, old sport, she was\nvery excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that\nfrightened her--that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper.\nAnd the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.\"\n\nHe sat down gloomily.\n\n\"Of course she might have loved him, just for a minute, when they were\nfirst married--and loved me more even then, do you see?\"\n\nSuddenly he came out with a curious remark:\n\n\"In any case,\" he said, \"it was just personal.\"\n\nWhat could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in\nhis conception of the affair that couldn't be measured?\n\nHe came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding\ntrip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville\non the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week, walking the\nstreets where their footsteps had clicked together through the\nNovember night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which\nthey had driven in her white car. Just as Daisy's house had always\nseemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses so his\nidea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded\nwith a melancholy beauty.\n\nHe left feeling that if he had searched harder he might have found\nher--that he was leaving her behind. The day-coach--he was penniless\nnow--was hot. He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a\nfolding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar\nbuildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow\ntrolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have\nseen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.\n\nThe track curved and now it was going away from the sun which, as it\nsank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing\ncity where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand\ndesperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of\nthe spot that she had made lovely for him. But it was all going by too\nfast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of\nit, the freshest and the best, forever.\n\n\nIt was nine o'clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the\nporch. The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there\nwas an autumn flavor in the air. The gardener, the last one of Gatsby's\nformer servants, came to the foot of the steps.\n\n\"I'm going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. Leaves'll start falling\npretty soon and then there's always trouble with the pipes.\"\n\n\"Don't do it today,\" Gatsby answered. He turned to me apologetically.\n\"You know, old sport, I've never used that pool all summer?\"\n\nI looked at my watch and stood up.\n\n\"Twelve minutes to my train.\"\n\nI didn't want to go to the city. I wasn't worth a decent stroke of work\nbut it was more than that--I didn't want to leave Gatsby. I missed that\ntrain, and then another, before I could get myself away.\n\n\"I'll call you up,\" I said finally.\n\n\"Do, old sport.\"\n\n\"I'll call you about noon.\"\n\nWe walked slowly down the steps.\n\n\"I suppose Daisy'll call too.\" He looked at me anxiously as if he\nhoped I'd corroborate this.\n\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\n\"Well--goodbye.\"\n\nWe shook hands and I started away. Just before I reached the hedge I\nremembered something and turned around.\n\n\"They're a rotten crowd,\" I shouted across the lawn. \"You're worth the\nwhole damn bunch put together.\"\n\nI've always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever gave\nhim, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end. First he nodded\npolitely, and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding\nsmile, as if we'd been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time.\nHis gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of color against the\nwhite steps and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral\nhome three months before. The lawn and drive had been crowded with the\nfaces of those who guessed at his corruption--and he had stood on those\nsteps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye.\n\nI thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thanking him for\nthat--I and the others.\n\n\"Goodbye,\" I called. \"I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.\"\n\n\nUp in the city I tried for a while to list the quotations on an\ninterminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair.\nJust before noon the phone woke me and I started up with sweat\nbreaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker; she often called\nme up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements\nbetween hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find\nin any other way. Usually her voice came over the wire as something\nfresh and cool as if a divot from a green golf links had come\nsailing in at the office window but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.\n\n\"I've left Daisy's house,\" she said. \"I'm at Hempstead and I'm going down\nto Southampton this afternoon.\"\n\nProbably it had been tactful to leave Daisy's house, but the act\nannoyed me and her next remark made me rigid.\n\n\"You weren't so nice to me last night.\"\n\n\"How could it have mattered then?\"\n\nSilence for a moment. Then--\n\n\"However--I want to see you.\"\n\n\"I want to see you too.\"\n\n\"Suppose I don't go to Southampton, and come into town this afternoon?\"\n\n\"No--I don't think this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\"It's impossible this afternoon. Various----\"\n\nWe talked like that for a while and then abruptly we weren't talking any\nlonger. I don't know which of us hung up with a sharp click but I know I\ndidn't care. I couldn't have talked to her across a tea-table that day if\nI never talked to her again in this world.\n\nI called Gatsby's house a few minutes later, but the line was busy. I\ntried four times; finally an exasperated central told me the wire was\nbeing kept open for long distance from Detroit. Taking out my\ntime-table I drew a small circle around the three-fifty train. Then I\nleaned back in my chair and tried to think. It was just noon.\n\n\nWhen I passed the ashheaps on the train that morning I had crossed\ndeliberately to the other side of the car. I suppose there'd be a\ncurious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark\nspots in the dust and some garrulous man telling over and over what\nhad happened until it became less and less real even to him and he\ncould tell it no longer and Myrtle Wilson's tragic achievement was\nforgotten. Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at the\ngarage after we left there the night before.\n\nThey had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine. She must\nhave broken her rule against drinking that night for when she\narrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the\nambulance had already gone to Flushing. When they convinced her of\nthis she immediately fainted as if that was the intolerable part of\nthe affair. Someone kind or curious took her in his car and drove\nher in the wake of her sister's body.\n\nUntil long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front\nof the garage while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the\ncouch inside. For a while the door of the office was open and\neveryone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it.\nFinally someone said it was a shame and closed the door. Michaelis and\nseveral other men were with him--first four or five men, later two or\nthree men. Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger to wait\nthere fifteen minutes longer while he went back to his own place and made\na pot of coffee. After that he stayed there alone with Wilson until dawn.\n\nAbout three o'clock the quality of Wilson's incoherent muttering\nchanged--he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car. He\nannounced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged\nto, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had\ncome from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen.\n\nBut when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry \"Oh,\nmy God!\" again in his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt\nto distract him.\n\n\"How long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sit\nstill a minute and answer my question. How long have you been married?\"\n\n\"Twelve years.\"\n\n\"Ever had any children? Come on, George, sit still--I asked you a\nquestion. Did you ever have any children?\"\n\nThe hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light and whenever\nMichaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him\nlike the car that hadn't stopped a few hours before. He didn't like to go\ninto the garage because the work bench was stained where the body had\nbeen lying so he moved uncomfortably around the office--he knew every\nobject in it before morning--and from time to time sat down beside Wilson\ntrying to keep him more quiet.\n\n\"Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if you\nhaven't been there for a long time? Maybe I could call up the church\nand get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?\"\n\n\"Don't belong to any.\"\n\n\"You ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must have\ngone to church once. Didn't you get married in a church? Listen, George,\nlisten to me. Didn't you get married in a church?\"\n\n\"That was a long time ago.\"\n\nThe effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking--for a moment he\nwas silent. Then the same half knowing, half bewildered look came back\ninto his faded eyes.\n\n\"Look in the drawer there,\" he said, pointing at the desk.\n\n\"Which drawer?\"\n\n\"That drawer--that one.\"\n\nMichaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it but\na small expensive dog leash made of leather and braided silver. It was\napparently new.\n\n\"This?\" he inquired, holding it up.\n\nWilson stared and nodded.\n\n\"I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it but I\nknew it was something funny.\"\n\n\"You mean your wife bought it?\"\n\n\"She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.\"\n\nMichaelis didn't see anything odd in that and he gave Wilson a dozen\nreasons why his wife might have bought the dog leash. But conceivably\nWilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle,\nbecause he began saying \"Oh, my God!\" again in a whisper--his comforter\nleft several explanations in the air.\n\n\"Then he killed her,\" said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly.\n\n\"Who did?\"\n\n\"I have a way of finding out.\"\n\n\"You're morbid, George,\" said his friend. \"This has been a strain to you\nand you don't know what you're saying. You'd better try and sit quiet\ntill morning.\"\n\n\"He murdered her.\"\n\n\"It was an accident, George.\"\n\nWilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly\nwith the ghost of a superior \"Hm!\"\n\n\"I know,\" he said definitely, \"I'm one of these trusting fellas and I\ndon't think any harm to NObody, but when I get to know a thing I know\nit. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he\nwouldn't stop.\"\n\nMichaelis had seen this too but it hadn't occurred to him that there was\nany special significance in it. He believed that Mrs. Wilson had been\nrunning away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any\nparticular car.\n\n\"How could she of been like that?\"\n\n\"She's a deep one,\" said Wilson, as if that answered the question.\n\"Ah-h-h----\"\n\nHe began to rock again and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in\nhis hand.\n\n\"Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?\"\n\nThis was a forlorn hope--he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend:\nthere was not enough of him for his wife. He was glad a little later when\nhe noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and\nrealized that dawn wasn't far off. About five o'clock it was blue enough\noutside to snap off the light.\n\nWilson's glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps, where small grey\nclouds took on fantastic shape and scurried here and there in the faint\ndawn wind.\n\n\"I spoke to her,\" he muttered, after a long silence. \"I told her she might\nfool me but she couldn't fool God. I took her to the window--\" With an\neffort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face\npressed against it, \"--and I said 'God knows what you've been doing,\neverything you've been doing. You may fool me but you can't fool God!' \"\n\nStanding behind him Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the\neyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg which had just emerged pale and enormous\nfrom the dissolving night.\n\n\"God sees everything,\" repeated Wilson.\n\n\"That's an advertisement,\" Michaelis assured him. Something made him turn\naway from the window and look back into the room. But Wilson stood there a\nlong time, his face close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight.\n\n\nBy six o'clock Michaelis was worn out and grateful for the sound of a\ncar stopping outside. It was one of the watchers of the night before\nwho had promised to come back so he cooked breakfast for three which\nhe and the other man ate together. Wilson was quieter now and Michaelis\nwent home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the\ngarage Wilson was gone.\n\nHis movements--he was on foot all the time--were afterward traced to Port\nRoosevelt and then to Gad's Hill where he bought a sandwich that he\ndidn't eat and a cup of coffee. He must have been tired and walking\nslowly for he didn't reach Gad's Hill until noon. Thus far there was\nno difficulty in accounting for his time--there were boys who had seen a\nman \"acting sort of crazy\" and motorists at whom he stared oddly from\nthe side of the road. Then for three hours he disappeared from view.\nThe police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he \"had\na way of finding out,\" supposed that he spent that time going from\ngarage to garage thereabouts inquiring for a yellow car. On the other\nhand no garage man who had seen him ever came forward--and perhaps he\nhad an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to know. By\nhalf past two he was in West Egg where he asked someone the way to\nGatsby's house. So by that time he knew Gatsby's name.\n\n\nAt two o'clock Gatsby put on his bathing suit and left word with the\nbutler that if any one phoned word was to be brought to him at the\npool. He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused\nhis guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him pump it up.\nThen he gave instructions that the open car wasn't to be taken out\nunder any circumstances--and this was strange because the front right\nfender needed repair.\n\nGatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once he\nstopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he\nneeded help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among\nthe yellowing trees.\n\nNo telephone message arrived but the butler went without his sleep and\nwaited for it until four o'clock--until long after there was any one to\ngive it to if it came. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn't\nbelieve it would come and perhaps he no longer cared. If that was true\nhe must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high\nprice for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up\nat an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he\nfound what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was\nupon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being\nreal, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted\nfortuitously about . . . like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward\nhim through the amorphous trees.\n\nThe chauffeur--he was one of Wolfsheim's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s--heard the\nshots--afterward he could only say that he hadn't thought anything much\nabout them. I drove from the station directly to Gatsby's house and my\nrushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed any\none. But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a word said, four\nof us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener and I, hurried down to the pool.\n\nThere was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the\nfresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other.\nWith little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden\nmattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that\nscarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental\ncourse with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves\nrevolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of compass, a thin red circle\nin the water.\n\nIt was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener\nsaw Wilson's body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was\ncomplete.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\n\n\nAfter two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the\nnext day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and\nnewspaper men in and out of Gatsby's front door. A rope stretched\nacross the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but\nlittle boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard and\nthere were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the pool.\nSomeone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the\nexpression \"mad man\" as he bent over Wilson's body that afternoon, and\nthe adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper\nreports next morning.\n\nMost of those reports were a nightmare--grotesque, circumstantial,\neager and untrue. When Michaelis's testimony at the inquest brought to\nlight Wilson's suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would\nshortly be served up in racy pasquinade--but Catherine, who might have\nsaid anything, didn't say a word. She showed a surprising amount of\ncharacter about it too--looked at the coroner with determined eyes under\nthat corrected brow of hers and swore that her sister had never seen\nGatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her\nsister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced herself of it\nand cried into her handkerchief as if the very suggestion was more\nthan she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a man \"deranged by\ngrief\" in order that the case might remain in its simplest form. And\nit rested there.\n\nBut all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself on\nGatsby's side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of\nthe catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and\nevery practical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and\nconfused; then, as he lay in his house and didn't move or breathe or\nspeak hour upon hour it grew upon me that I was responsible, because no\none else was interested--interested, I mean, with that intense personal\ninterest to which every one has some vague right at the end.\n\nI called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her\ninstinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away\nearly that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.\n\n\"Left no address?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Say when they'd be back?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Any idea where they are? How I could reach them?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Can't say.\"\n\nI wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where he\nlay and reassure him: \"I'll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don't worry.\nJust trust me and I'll get somebody for you----\"\n\nMeyer Wolfsheim's name wasn't in the phone book. The butler gave me his\noffice address on Broadway and I called Information, but by the time I\nhad the number it was long after five and no one answered the phone.\n\n\"Will you ring again?\"\n\n\"I've rung them three times.\"\n\n\"It's very important.\"\n\n\"Sorry. I'm afraid no one's there.\"\n\nI went back to the drawing room and thought for an instant that they were\nchance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it. But\nas they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with unmoved eyes,\nhis protest continued in my brain.\n\n\"Look here, old sport, you've got to get somebody for me. You've got\nto try hard. I can't go through this alone.\"\n\nSome one started to ask me questions but I broke away and going upstairs\nlooked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk--he'd never told me\ndefinitely that his parents were dead. But there was nothing--only the\npicture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence staring down from\nthe wall.\n\nNext morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfsheim\nwhich asked for information and urged him to come out on the next\ntrain. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure he'd\nstart when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there'd be a wire\nfrom Daisy before noon--but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfsheim arrived, no\none arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men.\nWhen the butler brought back Wolfsheim's answer I began to have a\nfeeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me\nagainst them all.\n\n\n_Dear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my\nlife to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a mad\nact as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down now as\nI am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in\nthis thing now. If there is anything I can do a little later let me\nknow in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when I hear about a\nthing like this and am completely knocked down and out.\n\n                                        Yours truly\n                                                      MEYER Wolfsheim_\n\nand then hasty addenda beneath:\n\n_Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all._\n\n\nWhen the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was\ncalling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came\nthrough as a man's voice, very thin and far away.\n\n\"This is Slagle speaking. . . .\"\n\n\"Yes?\" The name was unfamiliar.\n\n\"Hell of a note, isn't it? Get my wire?\"\n\n\"There haven't been any wires.\"\n\n\"Young Parke's in trouble,\" he said rapidly. \"They picked him up when he\nhanded the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New York\ngiving 'em the numbers just five minutes before. What d'you know about\nthat, hey? You never can tell in these hick towns----\"\n\n\"Hello!\" I interrupted breathlessly. \"Look here--this isn't Mr. Gatsby.\nMr. Gatsby's dead.\"\n\nThere was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an\nexclamation . . . then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.\n\n\nI think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz\narrived from a town in Minnesota. It said only that the sender was\nleaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.\n\nIt was Gatsby's father, a solemn old man very helpless and dismayed,\nbundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day. His\neyes leaked continuously with excitement and when I took the bag and\numbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse\ngrey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was on the\npoint of collapse so I took him into the music room and made him sit\ndown while I sent for something to eat. But he wouldn't eat and the\nglass of milk spilled from his trembling hand.\n\n\"I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,\" he said. \"It was all in the Chicago\nnewspaper. I started right away.\"\n\n\"I didn't know how to reach you.\"\n\nHis eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room.\n\n\"It was a mad man,\" he said. \"He must have been mad.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you like some coffee?\" I urged him.\n\n\"I don't want anything. I'm all right now, Mr.----\"\n\n\"Carraway.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?\"\n\nI took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him there.\nSome little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall;\nwhen I told them who had arrived they went reluctantly away.\n\nAfter a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth\najar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and\nunpunctual tears. He had reached an age where death no longer has the\nquality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the\nfirst time and saw the height and splendor of the hall and the great\nrooms opening out from it into other rooms his grief began to be mixed\nwith an awed pride. I helped him to a bedroom upstairs; while he took\noff his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been\ndeferred until he came.\n\n\"I didn't know what you'd want, Mr. Gatsby----\"\n\n\"Gatz is my name.\"\n\n\"--Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body west.\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position in\nthe East. Were you a friend of my boy's, Mr.--?\"\n\n\"We were close friends.\"\n\n\"He had a big future before him, you know. He was only a young man but\nhe had a lot of brain power here.\"\n\nHe touched his head impressively and I nodded.\n\n\"If he'd of lived he'd of been a great man. A man like James J. Hill.\nHe'd of helped build up the country.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" I said, uncomfortably.\n\nHe fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the bed,\nand lay down stiffly--was instantly asleep.\n\nThat night an obviously frightened person called up and demanded to know\nwho I was before he would give his name.\n\n\"This is Mr. Carraway,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh--\" He sounded relieved. \"This is Klipspringer.\"\n\nI was relieved too for that seemed to promise another friend\nat Gatsby's grave. I didn't want it to be in the papers and draw\na sightseeing crowd so I'd been calling up a few people myself.\nThey were hard to find.\n\n\"The funeral's tomorrow,\" I said. \"Three o'clock, here at the house.\nI wish you'd tell anybody who'd be interested.\"\n\n\"Oh, I will,\" he broke out hastily. \"Of course I'm not likely to see\nanybody, but if I do.\"\n\nHis tone made me suspicious.\n\n\"Of course you'll be there yourself.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll certainly try. What I called up about is----\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" I interrupted. \"How about saying you'll come?\"\n\n\"Well, the fact is--the truth of the matter is that I'm staying with\nsome people up here in Greenwich and they rather expect me to be with\nthem tomorrow. In fact there's a sort of picnic or something.\nOf course I'll do my very best to get away.\"\n\nI ejaculated an unrestrained \"Huh!\" and he must have heard me for he went\non nervously:\n\n\"What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. I wonder if\nit'd be too much trouble to have the butler send them on. You\nsee they're tennis shoes and I'm sort of helpless without them. My\naddress is care of B. F.----\"\n\nI didn't hear the rest of the name because I hung up the receiver.\n\nAfter that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby--one gentleman to whom I\ntelephoned implied that he had got what he deserved. However, that was\nmy fault, for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at\nGatsby on the courage of Gatsby's liquor and I should have known\nbetter than to call him.\n\nThe morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer\nWolfsheim; I couldn't seem to reach him any other way. The door that I\npushed open on the advice of an elevator boy was marked \"The Swastika\nHolding Company\" and at first there didn't seem to be any one inside.\nBut when I'd shouted \"Hello\" several times in vain an argument broke\nout behind a partition and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an\ninterior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes.\n\n\"Nobody's in,\" she said. \"Mr. Wolfsheim's gone to Chicago.\"\n\nThe first part of this was obviously untrue for someone had begun to\nwhistle \"The Rosary,\" tunelessly, inside.\n\n\"Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.\"\n\n\"I can't get him back from Chicago, can I?\"\n\nAt this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfsheim's called \"Stella!\"\nfrom the other side of the door.\n\n\"Leave your name on the desk,\" she said quickly. \"I'll give it to him\nwhen he gets back.\"\n\n\"But I know he's there.\"\n\nShe took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up\nand down her hips.\n\n\"You young men think you can force your way in here any time,\" she\nscolded. \"We're getting sickantired of it. When I say he's in Chicago,\nhe's in ChiCAgo.\"\n\nI mentioned Gatsby.\n\n\"Oh--h!\" She looked at me over again. \"Will you just--what was your name?\"\n\nShe vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfsheim stood solemnly in the doorway,\nholding out both hands. He drew me into his office, remarking in a\nreverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered me\na cigar.\n\n\"My memory goes back to when I first met him,\" he said. \"A young\nmajor just out of the army and covered over with medals he got\nin the war. He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform\nbecause he couldn't buy some regular clothes. First time I saw him was\nwhen he come into Winebrenner's poolroom at Forty-third Street and\nasked for a job. He hadn't eat anything for a couple of days. 'Come on\nhave some lunch with me,' I sid. He ate more than four dollars' worth of\nfood in half an hour.\"\n\n\"Did you start him in business?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Start him! I made him.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right\naway he was a fine appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told\nme he was an Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join up\nin the American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he\ndid some work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like\nthat in everything--\" He held up two bulbous fingers \"--always\ntogether.\"\n\nI wondered if this partnership had included the World's Series transaction\nin 1919.\n\n\"Now he's dead,\" I said after a moment. \"You were his closest friend,\nso I know you'll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.\"\n\n\"I'd like to come.\"\n\n\"Well, come then.\"\n\nThe hair in his nostrils quivered slightly and as he shook his head his\neyes filled with tears.\n\n\"I can't do it--I can't get mixed up in it,\" he said.\n\n\"There's nothing to get mixed up in. It's all over now.\"\n\n\"When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way.\nI keep out. When I was a young man it was different--if a friend of mine\ndied, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You may think that's\nsentimental but I mean it--to the bitter end.\"\n\nI saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come,\nso I stood up.\n\n\"Are you a college man?\" he inquired suddenly.\n\nFor a moment I thought he was going to suggest a \"gonnegtion\" but he\nonly nodded and shook my hand.\n\n\"Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not\nafter he is dead,\" he suggested. \"After that my own rule is to let\neverything alone.\"\n\nWhen I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West Egg\nin a drizzle. After changing my clothes I went next door and found\nMr. Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall. His pride in his\nson and in his son's possessions was continually increasing and now he\nhad something to show me.\n\n\"Jimmy sent me this picture.\" He took out his wallet with trembling\nfingers. \"Look there.\"\n\nIt was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirty with\nmany hands. He pointed out every detail to me eagerly. \"Look there!\" and\nthen sought admiration from my eyes. He had shown it so often that I think\nit was more real to him now than the house itself.\n\n\"Jimmy sent it to me. I think it's a very pretty picture. It shows up\nwell.\"\n\n\"Very well. Had you seen him lately?\"\n\n\"He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in\nnow. Of course we was broke up when he run off from home but I see now\nthere was a reason for it. He knew he had a big future in front of him.\nAnd ever since he made a success he was very generous with me.\"\n\nHe seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another minute,\nlingeringly, before my eyes. Then he returned the wallet and pulled from\nhis pocket a ragged old copy of a book called \"Hopalong Cassidy.\"\n\n\"Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows\nyou.\"\n\nHe opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see.\nOn the last fly-leaf was printed the word SCHEDULE, and the date\nSeptember 12th, 1906. And underneath:\n\n\nRise from bed . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  6.00       A.M.\nDumbbell exercise and wall-scaling . . . . . . 6.15-6.30   \"\nStudy electricity, etc . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.15-8.15   \"\nWork . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8.30-4.30  P.M.\nBaseball and sports . . . . . . . . . . . . .  4.30-5.00   \"\nPractice elocution, poise and how to attain it 5.00-6.00   \"\nStudy needed inventions . . . . . . . . . . .  7.00-9.00   \"\n\n                GENERAL RESOLVES\n\nNo wasting time at Shafters or [a name, indecipherable]\nNo more smokeing or chewing\nBath every other day\nRead one improving book or magazine per week\nSave $5.00 [crossed out] $3.00 per week\nBe better to parents\n\n\n\"I come across this book by accident,\" said the old man. \"It just shows\nyou, don't it?\"\n\n\"It just shows you.\"\n\n\"Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this or\nsomething. Do you notice what he's got about improving his mind? He was\nalways great for that. He told me I et like a hog once and I beat him\nfor it.\"\n\nHe was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then\nlooking eagerly at me. I think he rather expected me to copy down the\nlist for my own use.\n\nA little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing and\nI began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars. So did\nGatsby's father. And as the time passed and the servants came in and\nstood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously and he\nspoke of the rain in a worried uncertain way. The minister glanced\nseveral times at his watch so I took him aside and asked him to wait\nfor half an hour. But it wasn't any use. Nobody came.\n\n\nAbout five o'clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery\nand stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate--first a motor hearse,\nhorribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and I in the\nlimousine, and, a little later, four or five servants and the postman\nfrom West Egg in Gatsby's station wagon, all wet to the skin. As we\nstarted through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then\nthe sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. I looked\naround. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found\nmarvelling over Gatsby's books in the library one night three months\nbefore.\n\nI'd never seen him since then. I don't know how he knew about the\nfuneral or even his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses and\nhe took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled\nfrom Gatsby's grave.\n\nI tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment but he was already too\nfar away and I could only remember, without resentment, that Daisy\nhadn't sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur\n\"Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,\" and then the owl-eyed\nman said \"Amen to that,\" in a brave voice.\n\nWe straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-Eyes spoke\nto me by the gate.\n\n\"I couldn't get to the house,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Neither could anybody else.\"\n\n\"Go on!\" He started. \"Why, my God! they used to go there by the\nhundreds.\"\n\nHe took off his glasses and wiped them again outside and in.\n\n\"The poor son-of-a-bitch,\" he said.\n\n\nOne of my most vivid memories is of coming back west from prep school\nand later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than\nChicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o'clock of a\nDecember evening with a few Chicago friends already caught up into\ntheir own holiday gayeties to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember\nthe fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This or That's and\nthe chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as\nwe caught sight of old acquaintances and the matchings of invitations:\n\"Are you going to the Ordways'? the Herseys'? the Schultzes'?\"\nand the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands.\nAnd last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul\nRailroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside\nthe gate.\n\nWhen we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow,\nbegan to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the\ndim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace\ncame suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked\nback from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our\nidentity with this country for one strange hour before we melted\nindistinguishably into it again.\n\nThat's my middle west--not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede\ntowns but the thrilling, returning trains of my youth and the street\nlamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly\nwreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a\nlittle solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent\nfrom growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are\nstill called through decades by a family's name. I see now that this\nhas been a story of the West, after all--Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and\nJordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some\ndeficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.\n\nEven when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware\nof its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the\nOhio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the\nchildren and the very old--even then it had always for me a quality of\ndistortion. West Egg especially still figures in my more fantastic\ndreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at\nonce conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging\nsky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress\nsuits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a\ndrunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over\nthe side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a\nhouse--the wrong house. But no one knows the woman's name, and no one\ncares.\n\nAfter Gatsby's death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted\nbeyond my eyes' power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle\nleaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the\nline I decided to come back home.\n\nThere was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant\nthing that perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted to\nleave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent\nsea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and\naround what had happened to us together and what had happened\nafterward to me, and she lay perfectly still listening in a big\nchair.\n\nShe was dressed to play golf and I remember thinking she looked like a\ngood illustration, her chin raised a little, jauntily, her hair the\ncolor of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless\nglove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without comment that\nshe was engaged to another man. I doubted that though there were\nseveral she could have married at a nod of her head but I pretended to\nbe surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn't making a\nmistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say\ngoodbye.\n\n\"Nevertheless you did throw me over,\" said Jordan suddenly. \"You threw me\nover on the telephone. I don't give a damn about you now but it was a\nnew experience for me and I felt a little dizzy for a while.\"\n\nWe shook hands.\n\n\"Oh, and do you remember--\" she added, \"----a conversation we had once\nabout driving a car?\"\n\n\"Why--not exactly.\"\n\n\"You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver?\nWell, I met another bad driver, didn't I? I mean it was careless of me\nto make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest,\nstraightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.\"\n\n\"I'm thirty,\" I said. \"I'm five years too old to lie to myself and call\nit honor.\"\n\nShe didn't answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously\nsorry, I turned away.\n\n\nOne afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead\nof me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a\nlittle from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving\nsharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as I\nslowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into\nthe windows of a jewelry store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back\nholding out his hand.\n\n\"What's the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?\"\n\n\"Yes. You know what I think of you.\"\n\n\"You're crazy, Nick,\" he said quickly. \"Crazy as hell. I don't know\nwhat's the matter with you.\"\n\n\"Tom,\" I inquired, \"what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?\"\n\nHe stared at me without a word and I knew I had guessed right about\nthose missing hours. I started to turn away but he took a step after me\nand grabbed my arm.\n\n\"I told him the truth,\" he said. \"He came to the door while we were\ngetting ready to leave and when I sent down word that we weren't in he\ntried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if I\nhadn't told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his\npocket every minute he was in the house----\" He broke off defiantly.\n\"What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw\ndust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy's but he was a tough\none. He ran over Myrtle like you'd run over a dog and never even stopped\nhis car.\"\n\nThere was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact\nthat it wasn't true.\n\n\"And if you think I didn't have my share of suffering--look here, when I\nwent to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting\nthere on the sideboard I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it\nwas awful----\"\n\nI couldn't forgive him or like him but I saw that what he had done was,\nto him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused.\nThey were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and\ncreatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast\ncarelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other\npeople clean up the mess they had made. . . .\n\nI shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as\nthough I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewelry store to\nbuy a pearl necklace--or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons--rid of my\nprovincial squeamishness forever.\n\n\nGatsby's house was still empty when I left--the grass on his lawn had\ngrown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village never\ntook a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and\npointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to\nEast Egg the night of the accident and perhaps he had made a story\nabout it all his own. I didn't want to hear it and I avoided him when I\ngot off the train.\n\nI spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling\nparties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the\nmusic and the laughter faint and incessant from his garden and the\ncars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a material car\nthere and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I didn't\ninvestigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the\nends of the earth and didn't know that the party was over.\n\nOn the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer,\nI went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once\nmore. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a\npiece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight and I erased it,\ndrawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the\nbeach and sprawled out on the sand.\n\nMost of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any\nlights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound.\nAnd as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away\nuntil gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered\nonce for Dutch sailors' eyes--a fresh, green breast of the new world.\nIts vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby's house, had\nonce pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams;\nfor a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the\npresence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation\nhe neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in\nhistory with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.\n\nAnd as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of\nGatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of\nDaisy's dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must\nhave seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not\nknow that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity\nbeyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under\nthe night.\n\nGatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by\nyear recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow\nwe will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine\nmorning----\n\nSo we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into\nthe past.\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nProject Gutenberg Australia",

Scott Fitzgerald\n\n\n\nThen wear the gold hat, if that will move her;\n  If you can bounce high, bounce for her too,\nTill she cry \"Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover,\n  I must have you!\"\n\n                    --THOMAS PARKE D'INVILLIERS\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\n\n\nIn my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice\nthat I've been turning over in my mind ever since.\n\n\"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,\" he told me, \"just\nremember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages\nthat you've had.\"\n\nHe didn't say any more but we've always been unusually communicative\nin a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more\nthan that. In consequence I'm inclined to reserve all judgments,\na habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also\nmade me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind\nis quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it\nappears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I\nwas unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the\nsecret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were\nunsought--frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile\nlevity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate\nrevelation was quivering on the horizon--for the intimate revelations\nof young men or at least the terms in which they express them are\nusually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving\njudgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of\nmissing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested,\nand I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is\nparcelled out unequally at birth.\n\nAnd, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission\nthat it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet\nmarshes but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on.\nWhen I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the\nworld to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I\nwanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the\nhuman heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was\nexempt from my reaction--Gatsby who represented everything for which I\nhave an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of\nsuccessful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some\nheightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related\nto one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten\nthousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that\nflabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the\n\"creative temperament\"--it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic\nreadiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it\nis not likely I shall ever find again. No--Gatsby turned out all right\nat the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the\nwake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the\nabortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.\n\n\nMy family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle-western\ncity for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan and we\nhave a tradition that we're descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the\nactual founder of my line was my grandfather's brother who came here in\nfifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War and started the wholesale\nhardware business that my father carries on today.\n\nI never saw this great-uncle but I'm supposed to look like him--with\nspecial reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in\nFather's office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a\ncentury after my father, and a little later I participated in that\ndelayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the\ncounter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being\nthe warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like the\nragged edge of the universe--so I decided to go east and learn the bond\nbusiness. Everybody I knew was in the bond business so I supposed it\ncould support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it\nover as if they were choosing a prep-school for me and finally said,\n\"Why--ye-es\" with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance\nme for a year and after various delays I came east, permanently, I\nthought, in the spring of twenty-two.\n\nThe practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was a warm\nseason and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees,\nso when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house\ntogether in a commuting town it sounded like a great idea. He found\nthe house, a weather beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but\nat the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went out\nto the country alone. I had a dog, at least I had him for a few days\nuntil he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman who made my bed\nand cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the\nelectric stove.\n\nIt was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently\narrived than I, stopped me on the road.\n\n\"How do you get to West Egg village?\" he asked helplessly.\n\nI told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a\npathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the\nfreedom of the neighborhood.\n\nAnd so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the\ntrees--just as things grow in fast movies--I had that familiar\nconviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.\n\nThere was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health to be\npulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen\nvolumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood\non my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to\nunfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas\nknew. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides.\nI was rather literary in college--one year I wrote a series of very\nsolemn and obvious editorials for the \"Yale News\"--and now I was going\nto bring back all such things into my life and become again that most\nlimited of all specialists, the \"well-rounded man.\" This isn't just an\nepigram--life is much more successfully looked at from a single window,\nafter all.\n\nIt was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of\nthe strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender\nriotous island which extends itself due east of New York and where\nthere are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of\nland. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in\ncontour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most\ndomesticated body of salt water in the Western Hemisphere, the great\nwet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals--like the\negg in the Columbus story they are both crushed flat at the contact\nend--but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual\nconfusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more\narresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except\nshape and size.\n\nI lived at West Egg, the--well, the less fashionable of the two, though\nthis is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little\nsinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the\negg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge\nplaces that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on\nmy right was a colossal affair by any standard--it was a factual\nimitation of some H\u00f4tel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side,\nspanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool\nand more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby's mansion.\nOr rather, as I didn't know Mr. Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by\na gentleman of that name. My own house was an eye-sore, but it was a\nsmall eye-sore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the\nwater, a partial view of my neighbor's lawn, and the consoling\nproximity of millionaires--all for eighty dollars a month.\n\nAcross the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg\nglittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins\non the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom\nBuchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed and I'd known Tom\nin college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in\nChicago.\n\nHer husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of\nthe most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven--a\nnational figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute\nlimited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of\nanti-climax. His family were enormously wealthy--even in college his\nfreedom with money was a matter for reproach--but now he'd left Chicago\nand come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for\ninstance he'd brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest.\nIt was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy\nenough to do that.\n\nWhy they came east I don't know. They had spent a year in France, for no\nparticular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever\npeople played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move,\nsaid Daisy over the telephone, but I didn't believe it--I had no sight\ninto Daisy's heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking\na little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable\nfootball game.\n\nAnd so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East\nEgg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was\neven more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red and white Georgian\nColonial mansion overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach\nand ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over\nsun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens--finally when it reached\nthe house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the\nmomentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows,\nglowing now with reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy\nafternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his\nlegs apart on the front porch.\n\nHe had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy, straw haired\nman of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner.\nTwo shining, arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and\ngave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not\neven the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous\npower of that body--he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he\nstrained the top lacing and you could see a great pack of muscle\nshifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body\ncapable of enormous leverage--a cruel body.\n\nHis speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of\nfractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in\nit, even toward people he liked--and there were men at New Haven who had\nhated his guts.\n\n\"Now, don't think my opinion on these matters is final,\" he seemed to\nsay, \"just because I'm stronger and more of a man than you are.\" We\nwere in the same Senior Society, and while we were never intimate I\nalways had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like\nhim with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.\n\nWe talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.\n\n\"I've got a nice place here,\" he said, his eyes flashing about\nrestlessly.\n\nTurning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat hand along the\nfront vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half\nacre of deep pungent roses and a snub-nosed motor boat that bumped\nthe tide off shore.\n\n\"It belonged to Demaine the oil man.\" He turned me around again,\npolitely and abruptly. \"We'll go inside.\"\n\nWe walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space,\nfragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end.\nThe windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass\noutside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze\nblew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other\nlike pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of\nthe ceiling--and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a\nshadow on it as wind does on the sea.\n\nThe only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch\non which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored\nballoon. They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and\nfluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight\naround the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the\nwhip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall.\nThen there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught\nwind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two\nyoung women ballooned slowly to the floor.\n\nThe younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length\nat her end of the divan, completely motionless and with her chin raised\na little as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely\nto fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of\nit--indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having\ndisturbed her by coming in.\n\nThe other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise--she leaned slightly\nforward with a conscientious expression--then she laughed, an absurd,\ncharming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the\nroom.\n\n\"I'm p-paralyzed with happiness.\"\n\nShe laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand\nfor a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one\nin the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had.\nShe hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker.\n(I've heard it said that Daisy's murmur was only to make people\nlean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)\n\nAt any rate Miss Baker's lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost\nimperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back again--the object\nshe was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something\nof a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any\nexhibition of complete self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.\n\nI looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low,\nthrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and\ndown as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be\nplayed again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,\nbright eyes and a bright passionate mouth--but there was an excitement\nin her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget:\na singing compulsion, a whispered \"Listen,\" a promise that she had done\ngay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,\nexciting things hovering in the next hour.\n\nI told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way east\nand how a dozen people had sent their love through me.\n\n\"Do they miss me?\" she cried ecstatically.\n\n\"The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel\npainted black as a mourning wreath and there's a persistent wail all\nnight along the North Shore.\"\n\n\"How gorgeous! Let's go back, Tom. Tomorrow!\" Then she added\nirrelevantly, \"You ought to see the baby.\"\n\n\"I'd like to.\"\n\n\"She's asleep. She's two years old. Haven't you ever seen her?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Well, you ought to see her. She's----\"\n\nTom Buchanan who had been hovering restlessly about the room stopped\nand rested his hand on my shoulder.\n\n\"What you doing, Nick?\"\n\n\"I'm a bond man.\"\n\n\"Who with?\"\n\nI told him.\n\n\"Never heard of them,\" he remarked decisively.\n\nThis annoyed me.\n\n\"You will,\" I answered shortly. \"You will if you stay in the East.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll stay in the East, don't you worry,\" he said, glancing at\nDaisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more.\n\"I'd be a God Damned fool to live anywhere else.\"\n\nAt this point Miss Baker said \"Absolutely!\" with such suddenness that I\nstarted--it was the first word she uttered since I came into the room.\nEvidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and\nwith a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.\n\n\"I'm stiff,\" she complained, \"I've been lying on that sofa for as long\nas I can remember.\"\n\n\"Don't look at me,\" Daisy retorted. \"I've been trying to get you to New\nYork all afternoon.\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the\npantry, \"I'm absolutely in training.\"\n\nHer host looked at her incredulously.\n\n\"You are!\" He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of\na glass. \"How you ever get anything done is beyond me.\"\n\nI looked at Miss Baker wondering what it was she \"got done.\" I enjoyed\nlooking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect\ncarriage which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the\nshoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at\nme with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming discontented\nface. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her,\nsomewhere before.\n\n\"You live in West Egg,\" she remarked contemptuously. \"I know somebody\nthere.\"\n\n\"I don't know a single----\"\n\n\"You must know Gatsby.\"\n\n\"Gatsby?\" demanded Daisy. \"What Gatsby?\"\n\nBefore I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced;\nwedging his tense arm imperatively under mine Tom Buchanan compelled\nme from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.\n\nSlenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips the two\nyoung women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch open toward the\nsunset where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished\nwind.\n\n\"Why CANDLES?\" objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her\nfingers. \"In two weeks it'll be the longest day in the year.\"\nShe looked at us all radiantly. \"Do you always watch for the longest day\nof the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the\nyear and then miss it.\"\n\n\"We ought to plan something,\" yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the\ntable as if she were getting into bed.\n\n\"All right,\" said Daisy. \"What'll we plan?\" She turned to me helplessly.\n\"What do people plan?\"\n\nBefore I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her\nlittle finger.\n\n\"Look!\" she complained. \"I hurt it.\"\n\nWe all looked--the knuckle was black and blue.\n\n\"You did it, Tom,\" she said accusingly. \"I know you didn't mean to\nbut you DID do it. That's what I get for marrying a brute of a man,\na great big hulking physical specimen of a----\"\n\n\"I hate that word hulking,\" objected Tom crossly, \"even in kidding.\"\n\n\"Hulking,\" insisted Daisy.\n\nSometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a\nbantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool\nas their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all\ndesire. They were here--and they accepted Tom and me, making only a\npolite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew\nthat presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too\nwould be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the\nWest where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its\nclose in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer\nnervous dread of the moment itself.\n\n\"You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,\" I confessed on my second glass\nof corky but rather impressive claret. \"Can't you talk about crops or\nsomething?\"\n\nI meant nothing in particular by this remark but it was taken up in an\nunexpected way.\n\n\"Civilization's going to pieces,\" broke out Tom violently.\n\"I've gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read\n'The Rise of the Coloured Empires' by this man Goddard?\"\n\n\"Why, no,\" I answered, rather surprised by his tone.\n\n\"Well, it's a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if\nwe don't look out the white race will be--will be utterly submerged.\nIt's all scientific stuff; it's been proved.\"\n\n\"Tom's getting very profound,\" said Daisy with an expression of\nunthoughtful sadness. \"He reads deep books with long words in them.\nWhat was that word we----\"\n\n\"Well, these books are all scientific,\" insisted Tom, glancing at her\nimpatiently. \"This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up to us\nwho are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have\ncontrol of things.\"\n\n\"We've got to beat them down,\" whispered Daisy, winking ferociously\ntoward the fervent sun.\n\n\"You ought to live in California--\" began Miss Baker but Tom\ninterrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.\n\n\"This idea is that we're Nordics. I am, and you are and you are\nand----\" After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a\nslight nod and she winked at me again. \"--and we've produced all the\nthings that go to make civilization--oh, science and art and all that.\nDo you see?\"\n\nThere was something pathetic in his concentration as if his complacency,\nmore acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. When, almost\nimmediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy\nseized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.\n\n\"I'll tell you a family secret,\" she whispered enthusiastically. \"It's\nabout the butler's nose. Do you want to hear about the butler's nose?\"\n\n\"That's why I came over tonight.\"\n\n\"Well, he wasn't always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for\nsome people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people.\nHe had to polish it from morning till night until finally it began to\naffect his nose----\"\n\n\"Things went from bad to worse,\" suggested Miss Baker.\n\n\"Yes. Things went from bad to worse until finally he had to give up\nhis position.\"\n\nFor a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon\nher glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as\nI listened--then the glow faded, each light deserting her with\nlingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.\n\nThe butler came back and murmured something close to Tom's ear\nwhereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair and without a word went\ninside. As if his absence quickened something within her Daisy leaned\nforward again, her voice glowing and singing.\n\n\"I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a--of a rose, an\nabsolute rose. Doesn't he?\" She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation.\n\"An absolute rose?\"\n\nThis was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only\nextemporizing but a stirring warmth flowed from her as if her\nheart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those\nbreathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the\ntable and excused herself and went into the house.\n\nMiss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of\nmeaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said \"Sh!\" in\na warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room\nbeyond and Miss Baker leaned forward, unashamed, trying to hear. The\nmurmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted\nexcitedly, and then ceased altogether.\n\n\"This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor----\" I said.\n\n\"Don't talk. I want to hear what happens.\"\n\n\"Is something happening?\" I inquired innocently.\n\n\"You mean to say you don't know?\" said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.\n\"I thought everybody knew.\"\n\n\"I don't.\"\n\n\"Why----\" she said hesitantly, \"Tom's got some woman in New York.\"\n\n\"Got some woman?\" I repeated blankly.\n\nMiss Baker nodded.\n\n\"She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner-time. Don't\nyou think?\"\n\nAlmost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of\na dress and the crunch of leather boots and Tom and Daisy were back\nat the table.\n\n\"It couldn't be helped!\" cried Daisy with tense gayety.\n\nShe sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me and\ncontinued: \"I looked outdoors for a minute and it's very romantic\noutdoors. There's a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale\ncome over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He's singing away----\" her\nvoice sang \"----It's romantic, isn't it, Tom?\"\n\n\"Very romantic,\" he said, and then miserably to me: \"If it's light enough\nafter dinner I want to take you down to the stables.\"\n\nThe telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her\nhead decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all\nsubjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the\nlast five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again,\npointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every\none and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn't guess what Daisy and Tom\nwere thinking but I doubt if even Miss Baker who seemed to have\nmastered a certain hardy skepticism was able utterly to put this fifth\nguest's shrill metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament\nthe situation might have seemed intriguing--my own instinct was to\ntelephone immediately for the police.\n\nThe horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss\nBaker, with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into\nthe library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while\ntrying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf I followed\nDaisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In\nits deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.\n\nDaisy took her face in her hands, as if feeling its lovely shape, and\nher eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent\nemotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some\nsedative questions about her little girl.\n\n\"We don't know each other very well, Nick,\" she said suddenly.\n\"Even if we are cousins. You didn't come to my wedding.\"\n\n\"I wasn't back from the war.\"\n\n\"That's true.\" She hesitated. \"Well, I've had a very bad time, Nick,\nand I'm pretty cynical about everything.\"\n\nEvidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn't say any more,\nand after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her\ndaughter.\n\n\"I suppose she talks, and--eats, and everything.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\" She looked at me absently. \"Listen, Nick; let me tell you what\nI said when she was born. Would you like to hear?\"\n\n\"Very much.\"\n\n\"It'll show you how I've gotten to feel about--things. Well, she was less\nthan an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether\nwith an utterly abandoned feeling and asked the nurse right away if it\nwas a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head\naway and wept. 'All right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope\nshe'll be a fool--that's the best thing a girl can be in this world,\na beautiful little fool.\"\n\n\"You see I think everything's terrible anyhow,\" she went on in a\nconvinced way. \"Everybody thinks so--the most advanced people. And I KNOW.\nI've been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.\"\nHer eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom's, and she\nlaughed with thrilling scorn. \"Sophisticated--God, I'm sophisticated!\"\n\nThe instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention,\nmy belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said.\nIt made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick\nof some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited,\nand sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk\non her lovely face as if she had asserted her membership in a rather\ndistinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.\n\n\nInside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker\nsat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from\nthe \"Saturday Evening Post\"--the words, murmurous and\nuninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamp-light,\nbright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair,\nglinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender\nmuscles in her arms.\n\nWhen we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.\n\n\"To be continued,\" she said, tossing the magazine on the table, \"in our\nvery next issue.\"\n\nHer body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she\nstood up.\n\n\"Ten o'clock,\" she remarked, apparently finding the time on the\nceiling. \"Time for this good girl to go to bed.\"\n\n\"Jordan's going to play in the tournament tomorrow,\" explained Daisy,\n\"over at Westchester.\"\n\n\"Oh,--you're JORdan Baker.\"\n\nI knew now why her face was familiar--its pleasing contemptuous\nexpression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of\nthe sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I\nhad heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story,\nbut what it was I had forgotten long ago.\n\n\"Good night,\" she said softly. \"Wake me at eight, won't you.\"\n\n\"If you'll get up.\"\n\n\"I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.\"\n\n\"Of course you will,\" confirmed Daisy. \"In fact I think I'll arrange\na marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I'll sort of--oh--fling you\ntogether. You know--lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push\nyou out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing----\"\n\n\"Good night,\" called Miss Baker from the stairs. \"I haven't heard a word.\"\n\n\"She's a nice girl,\" said Tom after a moment. \"They oughtn't to let her\nrun around the country this way.\"\n\n\"Who oughtn't to?\" inquired Daisy coldly.\n\n\"Her family.\"\n\n\"Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick's\ngoing to look after her, aren't you, Nick? She's going to spend lots of\nweek-ends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very\ngood for her.\"\n\nDaisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.\n\n\"Is she from New York?\" I asked quickly.\n\n\"From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our\nbeautiful white----\"\n\n\"Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?\"\ndemanded Tom suddenly.\n\n\"Did I?\" She looked at me. \"I can't seem to remember, but I think\nwe talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I'm sure we did. It sort of\ncrept up on us and first thing you know----\"\n\n\"Don't believe everything you hear, Nick,\" he advised me.\n\nI said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later\nI got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood side by\nside in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor Daisy\nperemptorily called \"Wait!\n\n\"I forgot to ask you something, and it's important. We heard you were\nengaged to a girl out West.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" corroborated Tom kindly. \"We heard that you were\nengaged.\"\n\n\"It's libel. I'm too poor.\"\n\n\"But we heard it,\" insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in\na flower-like way. \"We heard it from three people so it must be true.\"\n\nOf course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn't even vaguely\nengaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the\nreasons I had come east. You can't stop going with an old friend on\naccount of rumors and on the other hand I had no intention of being\nrumored into marriage.\n\nTheir interest rather touched me and made them less remotely\nrich--nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove\naway. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of\nthe house, child in arms--but apparently there were no such intentions\nin her head. As for Tom, the fact that he \"had some woman in New York\"\nwas really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book.\nSomething was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his\nsturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.\n\nAlready it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside\ngarages, where new red gas-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I\nreached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for\na while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown\noff, leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees and\na persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the\nfrogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the\nmoonlight and turning my head to watch it I saw that I was not\nalone--fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my\nneighbor's mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets\nregarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely\nmovements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested\nthat it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was\nhis of our local heavens.\n\nI decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and\nthat would do for an introduction. But I didn't call to him for he gave\na sudden intimation that he was content to be alone--he stretched out his\narms toward the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him\nI could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward--and\ndistinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away,\nthat might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby\nhe had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n\n\nAbout half way between West Egg and New York the motor-road hastily\njoins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to\nshrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of\nashes--a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and\nhills and grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and\nchimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcendent effort, of\nmen who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.\nOccasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives\nout a ghastly creak and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey\nmen swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud\nwhich screens their obscure operations from your sight.\n\nBut above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift\nendlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T.\nJ. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and\ngigantic--their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face but,\ninstead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a\nnonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to\nfatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself\ninto eternal blindness or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes,\ndimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain, brood on over\nthe solemn dumping ground.\n\nThe valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and\nwhen the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on\nwaiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an\nhour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute and it was\nbecause of this that I first met Tom Buchanan's mistress.\n\nThe fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. His\nacquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular\nrestaurants with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about,\nchatting with whomsoever he knew. Though I was curious to see her I\nhad no desire to meet her--but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on\nthe train one afternoon and when we stopped by the ashheaps he jumped\nto his feet and taking hold of my elbow literally forced me from the\ncar.\n\n\"We're getting off!\" he insisted. \"I want you to meet my girl.\"\n\nI think he'd tanked up a good deal at luncheon and his determination to\nhave my company bordered on violence. The supercilious assumption was that\non Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.\n\nI followed him over a low white-washed railroad fence and we walked\nback a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg's persistent\nstare. The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick\nsitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street\nministering to it and contiguous to absolutely nothing. One of the\nthree shops it contained was for rent and another was an all-night\nrestaurant approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a\ngarage--Repairs. GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars Bought and Sold--and I followed\nTom inside.\n\nThe interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the\ndust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had\noccurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind and that\nsumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead when the\nproprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands\non a piece of waste. He was a blonde, spiritless man, anaemic, and\nfaintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his\nlight blue eyes.\n\n\"Hello, Wilson, old man,\" said Tom, slapping him jovially on the\nshoulder. \"How's business?\"\n\n\"I can't complain,\" answered Wilson unconvincingly. \"When are you going\nto sell me that car?\"\n\n\"Next week; I've got my man working on it now.\"\n\n\"Works pretty slow, don't he?\"\n\n\"No, he doesn't,\" said Tom coldly. \"And if you feel that way about it,\nmaybe I'd better sell it somewhere else after all.\"\n\n\"I don't mean that,\" explained Wilson quickly. \"I just meant----\"\n\nHis voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage. Then\nI heard footsteps on a stairs and in a moment the thickish figure of a\nwoman blocked out the light from the office door. She was in the middle\nthirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously\nas some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue\ncrepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty but there was an\nimmediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body\nwere continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and walking through her\nhusband as if he were a ghost shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in\nthe eye. Then she wet her lips and without turning around spoke to her\nhusband in a soft, coarse voice:\n\n\"Get some chairs, why don't you, so somebody can sit down.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" agreed Wilson hurriedly and went toward the little office,\nmingling immediately with the cement color of the walls. A white ashen\ndust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in\nthe vicinity--except his wife, who moved close to Tom.\n\n\"I want to see you,\" said Tom intently. \"Get on the next train.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\n\"I'll meet you by the news-stand on the lower level.\"\n\nShe nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson\nemerged with two chairs from his office door.\n\nWe waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days before\nthe Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting\ntorpedoes in a row along the railroad track.\n\n\"Terrible place, isn't it,\" said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor\nEckleburg.\n\n\"Awful.\"\n\n\"It does her good to get away.\"\n\n\"Doesn't her husband object?\"\n\n\"Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He's so dumb\nhe doesn't know he's alive.\"\n\nSo Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York--or not\nquite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom\ndeferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be\non the train.\n\nShe had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin which stretched\ntight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in\nNew York. At the news-stand she bought a copy of \"Town Tattle\" and a\nmoving-picture magazine and, in the station drug store, some cold cream\nand a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive\nshe let four taxi cabs drive away before she selected a new one,\nlavender-colored with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the\nmass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she\nturned sharply from the window and leaning forward tapped on the\nfront glass.\n\n\"I want to get one of those dogs,\" she said earnestly. \"I want to get one\nfor the apartment. They're nice to have--a dog.\"\n\nWe backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John\nD. Rockefeller. In a basket, swung from his neck, cowered a dozen very\nrecent puppies of an indeterminate breed.\n\n\"What kind are they?\" asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly as he came to the\ntaxi-window.\n\n\"All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?\"\n\n\"I'd like to get one of those police dogs; I don't suppose you got that\nkind?\"\n\nThe man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew\none up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.\n\n\"That's no police dog,\" said Tom.\n\n\"No, it's not exactly a polICE dog,\" said the man with disappointment\nin his voice. \"It's more of an airedale.\" He passed his hand over the\nbrown wash-rag of a back. \"Look at that coat. Some coat. That's a dog\nthat'll never bother you with catching cold.\"\n\n\"I think it's cute,\" said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. \"How much is it?\"\n\n\"That dog?\" He looked at it admiringly. \"That dog will cost you ten\ndollars.\"\n\nThe airedale--undoubtedly there was an airedale concerned in it somewhere\nthough its feet were startlingly white--changed hands and settled down\ninto Mrs. Wilson's lap, where she fondled the weather-proof coat with\nrapture.\n\n\"Is it a boy or a girl?\" she asked delicately.\n\n\"That dog? That dog's a boy.\"\n\n\"It's a bitch,\" said Tom decisively. \"Here's your money. Go and buy ten\nmore dogs with it.\"\n\nWe drove over to Fifth Avenue, so warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the\nsummer Sunday afternoon that I wouldn't have been surprised to see a great\nflock of white sheep turn the corner.\n\n\"Hold on,\" I said, \"I have to leave you here.\"\n\n\"No, you don't,\" interposed Tom quickly. \"Myrtle'll be hurt if you don't \ncome up to the apartment. Won't you,\nMyrtle?\"\n\n\"Come on,\" she urged. \"I'll telephone my sister Catherine. She's said to\nbe very beautiful by people who ought to know.\"\n\n\"Well, I'd like to, but----\"\n\nWe went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds.\nAt 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of\napartment houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the\nneighborhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases\nand went haughtily in.\n\n\"I'm going to have the McKees come up,\" she announced as we rose in the\nelevator. \"And of course I got to call up my sister, too.\"\n\nThe apartment was on the top floor--a small living room, a small\ndining room, a small bedroom and a bath. The living room was crowded to\nthe doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it\nso that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of\nladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was\nan over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred\nrock. Looked at from a distance however the hen resolved itself\ninto a bonnet and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down\ninto the room. Several old copies of \"Town Tattle \"lay on the table\ntogether with a copy of \"Simon Called Peter\" and some of the small\nscandal magazines of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with\nthe dog. A reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and\nsome milk to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large\nhard dog biscuits--one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer\nof milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whiskey\nfrom a locked bureau door.\n\nI have been drunk just twice in my life and the second time was that\nafternoon so everything that happened has a dim hazy cast over it\nalthough until after eight o'clock the apartment was full of cheerful\nsun. Sitting on Tom's lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the\ntelephone; then there were no cigarettes and I went out to buy some at\nthe drug store on the corner. When I came back they had disappeared so\nI sat down discreetly in the living room and read a chapter of \"Simon\nCalled Peter\"--either it was terrible stuff or the whiskey distorted\nthings because it didn't make any sense to me.\n\nJust as Tom and Myrtle--after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called\neach other by our first names--reappeared, company commenced to arrive\nat the apartment door.\n\nThe sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty\nwith a solid sticky bob of red hair and a complexion powdered milky\nwhite. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more\nrakish angle but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the\nold alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about\nthere was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets\njingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary\nhaste and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered\nif she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated\nmy question aloud and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel.\n\nMr. McKee was a pale feminine man from the flat below. He had just\nshaved for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone and he\nwas most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He\ninformed me that he was in the \"artistic game\" and I gathered later\nthat he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs.\nWilson's mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His wife\nwas shrill, languid, handsome and horrible. She told me with pride\nthat her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven times\nsince they had been married.\n\nMrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before and was now\nattired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream colored chiffon, which\ngave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room.\nWith the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a\nchange. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage\nwas converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her\nassertions became more violently affected moment by moment and as she\nexpanded the room grew smaller around her until she seemed to be\nrevolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.\n\n\"My dear,\" she told her sister in a high mincing shout, \"most of these\nfellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I had a\nwoman up here last week to look at my feet and when she gave me the\nbill you'd of thought she had my appendicitus out.\"\n\n\"What was the name of the woman?\" asked Mrs. McKee.\n\n\"Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people's feet in their own\nhomes.\"\n\n\"I like your dress,\" remarked Mrs. McKee, \"I think it's adorable.\"\n\nMrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.\n\n\"It's just a crazy old thing,\" she said. \"I just slip it on sometimes when\nI don't care what I look like.\"\n\n\"But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,\" pursued\nMrs. McKee. \"If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could\nmake something of it.\"\n\nWe all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson who removed a strand of hair from\nover her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee\nregarded her intently with his head on one side and then moved his hand\nback and forth slowly in front of his face.\n\n\"I should change the light,\" he said after a moment. \"I'd like to bring\nout the modelling of the features. And I'd try to get hold of all the\nback hair.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't think of changing the light,\" cried Mrs. McKee. \"I think\nit's----\"\n\nHer husband said \"SH!\" and we all looked at the subject again whereupon\nTom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.\n\n\"You McKees have something to drink,\" he said. \"Get some more ice and\nmineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.\"\n\n\"I told that boy about the ice.\" Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair\nat the shiftlessness of the lower orders. \"These people! You have to keep\nafter them all the time.\"\n\nShe looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the\ndog, kissed it with ecstasy and swept into the kitchen, implying that\na dozen chefs awaited her orders there.\n\n\"I've done some nice things out on Long Island,\" asserted Mr. McKee.\n\nTom looked at him blankly.\n\n\"Two of them we have framed downstairs.\"\n\n\"Two what?\" demanded Tom.\n\n\"Two studies. One of them I call 'Montauk Point--the Gulls,' and the\nother I call 'Montauk Point--the Sea.' \"\n\nThe sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.\n\n\"Do you live down on Long Island, too?\" she inquired.\n\n\"I live at West Egg.\"\n\n\"Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named\nGatsby's. Do you know him?\"\n\n\"I live next door to him.\"\n\n\"Well, they say he's a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm's. That's\nwhere all his money comes from.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"I'm scared of him. I'd hate to have him get anything on me.\"\n\nThis absorbing information about my neighbor was interrupted by\nMrs. McKee's pointing suddenly at Catherine:\n\n\"Chester, I think you could do something with HER,\" she broke out,\nbut Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way and turned his attention\nto Tom.\n\n\"I'd like to do more work on Long Island if I could get the entry. All\nI ask is that they should give me a start.\"\n\n\"Ask Myrtle,\" said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as\nMrs. Wilson entered with a tray. \"She'll give you a letter of\nintroduction, won't you, Myrtle?\"\n\n\"Do what?\" she asked, startled.\n\n\"You'll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can\ndo some studies of him.\" His lips moved silently for a moment as he\ninvented. \" 'George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,' or something like\nthat.\"\n\n\nCatherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear: \"Neither of them\ncan stand the person they're married to.\"\n\n\"Can't they?\"\n\n\"Can't STAND them.\" She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. \"What I say is,\nwhy go on living with them if they can't stand them? If I was them I'd get\na divorce and get married to each other right away.\"\n\n\"Doesn't she like Wilson either?\"\n\nThe answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle who had overheard\nthe question and it was violent and obscene.\n\n\"You see?\" cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again.\n\"It's really his wife that's keeping them apart. She's a Catholic and\nthey don't believe in divorce.\"\n\nDaisy was not a Catholic and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness\nof the lie.\n\n\"When they do get married,\" continued Catherine, \"they're going west to\nlive for a while until it blows over.\"\n\n\"It'd be more discreet to go to Europe.\"\n\n\"Oh, do you like Europe?\" she exclaimed surprisingly. \"I just got back\nfrom Monte Carlo.\"\n\n\"Really.\"\n\n\"Just last year. I went over there with another girl.\"\n\n\"Stay long?\"\n\n\"No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way of Marseilles.\nWe had over twelve hundred dollars when we started but we got gypped\nout of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had an awful time\ngetting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town!\"\n\nThe late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue\nhoney of the Mediterranean--then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me\nback into the room.\n\n\"I almost made a mistake, too,\" she declared vigorously. \"I almost\nmarried a little kyke who'd been after me for years. I knew he was\nbelow me. Everybody kept saying to me: 'Lucille, that man's way below\nyou!' But if I hadn't met Chester, he'd of got me sure.\"\n\n\"Yes, but listen,\" said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down,\n\"at least you didn't marry him.\"\n\n\"I know I didn't.\"\n\n\"Well, I married him,\" said Myrtle, ambiguously. \"And that's the\ndifference between your case and mine.\"\n\n\"Why did you, Myrtle?\" demanded Catherine. \"Nobody forced you to.\"\n\nMyrtle considered.\n\n\"I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,\" she said finally.\n\"I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn't fit to lick\nmy shoe.\"\n\n\"You were crazy about him for a while,\" said Catherine.\n\n\"Crazy about him!\" cried Myrtle incredulously. \"Who said I was crazy about\nhim? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man\nthere.\"\n\nShe pointed suddenly at me, and every one looked at me accusingly.\nI tried to show by my expression that I had played no part in her past.\n\n\"The only CRAZY I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made a\nmistake. He borrowed somebody's best suit to get married in and never\neven told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he was out.\nShe looked around to see who was listening: \" 'Oh, is that your suit?' I \nsaid.\n'This is the first I ever heard about it.' But I gave it to him and then I \nlay down\nand cried to beat the band all afternoon.\"\n\n\"She really ought to get away from him,\" resumed Catherine to me.\n\"They've been living over that garage for eleven years. And Tom's the\nfirst sweetie she ever had.\"\n\nThe bottle of whiskey--a second one--was now in constant demand by all\npresent, excepting Catherine who \"felt just as good on nothing at all.\"\nTom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches,\nwhich were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted to get out and walk\neastward toward the park through the soft twilight but each time I tried\nto go I became entangled in some wild strident argument which pulled me\nback, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city our line of\nyellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the\ncasual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and\nwondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled\nby the inexhaustible variety of life.\n\nMyrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath\npoured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.\n\n\"It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the\nlast ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my\nsister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather\nshoes and I couldn't keep my eyes off him but every time he looked at\nme I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head.\nWhen we came into the station he was next to me and his white\nshirt-front pressed against my arm--and so I told him I'd have to call\na policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into\na taxi with him I didn't hardly know I wasn't getting into a subway\ntrain. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was 'You can't live\nforever, you can't live forever.' \"\n\nShe turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial\nlaughter.\n\n\"My dear,\" she cried, \"I'm going to give you this dress as soon as I'm\nthrough with it. I've got to get another one tomorrow. I'm going to\nmake a list of all the things I've got to get. A massage and a wave\nand a collar for the dog and one of those cute little ash-trays where\nyou touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother's\ngrave that'll last all summer. I got to write down a list so I won't\nforget all the things I got to do.\"\n\nIt was nine o'clock--almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch\nand found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists\nclenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out my\nhandkerchief I wiped from his cheek the remains of the spot of dried\nlather that had worried me all the afternoon.\n\nThe little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through\nthe smoke and from time to time groaning faintly. People disappeared,\nreappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other,\nsearched for each other, found each other a few feet away. Some time\ntoward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face\ndiscussing in impassioned voices whether Mrs. Wilson had any right to\nmention Daisy's name.\n\n\"Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!\" shouted Mrs. Wilson. \"I'll say it whenever I want\nto! Daisy! Dai----\"\n\nMaking a short deft movement Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his\nopen hand.\n\nThen there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women's\nvoices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of\npain. Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the door.\nWhen he had gone half way he turned around and stared at the scene--his\nwife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and\nthere among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and the\ndespairing figure on the couch bleeding fluently and trying to spread\na copy of \"Town Tattle\" over the tapestry scenes of Versailles.\nThen Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the door. Taking my hat from\nthe chandelier I followed.\n\n\"Come to lunch some day,\" he suggested, as we groaned down in the\nelevator.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Anywhere.\"\n\n\"Keep your hands off the lever,\" snapped the elevator boy.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. McKee with dignity, \"I didn't know I was\ntouching it.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I agreed, \"I'll be glad to.\"\n\n. . . I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the\nsheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.\n\n\"Beauty and the Beast . . . Loneliness . . . Old Grocery Horse . . .\nBrook'n Bridge . . . .\"\n\nThen I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the Pennsylvania\nStation, staring at the morning \"Tribune\" and waiting for the four\no'clock train.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n\n\nThere was music from my neighbor's house through the summer nights. In\nhis blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the\nwhisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the\nafternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft or\ntaking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats\nslit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of\nfoam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties\nto and from the city, between nine in the morning and long past\nmidnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to\nmeet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants including an extra\ngardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers\nand garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.\n\nEvery Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer\nin New York--every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back\ndoor in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the\nkitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an\nhour, if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler's\nthumb.\n\nAt least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several\nhundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas\ntree of Gatsby's enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with\nglistening hors-d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of\nharlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold.\nIn the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked\nwith gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of\nhis female guests were too young to know one from another.\n\nBy seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived--no thin five-piece affair\nbut a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and\ncornets and piccolos and low and high drums. The last swimmers have\ncome in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from\nNew York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and\nsalons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors and hair shorn in\nstrange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The\nbar is in full swing and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the\ngarden outside until the air is alive with chatter and laughter and\ncasual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and\nenthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names.\n\nThe lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and\nnow the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music and the opera of\nvoices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier, minute by minute,\nspilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups\nchange more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the\nsame breath--already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave\nhere and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp,\njoyous moment the center of a group and then excited with triumph\nglide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the\nconstantly changing light.\n\nSuddenly one of these gypsies in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out\nof the air, dumps it down for courage and moving her hands like\nFrisco dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; the\norchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her and there is a\nburst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda\nGray's understudy from the \"Follies.\" The party has begun.\n\nI believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby's house I was one of\nthe few guests who had actually been invited. People were not\ninvited--they went there. They got into automobiles which bore them out\nto Long Island and somehow they ended up at Gatsby's door. Once there\nthey were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby and after that they\nconducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with\namusement parks. Sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby\nat all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own\nticket of admission.\n\nI had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of robin's egg\nblue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly\nformal note from his employer--the honor would be entirely Gatsby's, it\nsaid, if I would attend his \"little party\" that night. He had\nseen me several times and had intended to call on me long before\nbut a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it--signed\nJay Gatsby in a majestic hand.\n\nDressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after\nseven and wandered around rather ill-at-ease among swirls and eddies\nof people I didn't know--though here and there was a face I had noticed\non the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number of young\nEnglishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry\nand all talking in low earnest voices to solid and prosperous\nAmericans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or\ninsurance or automobiles. They were, at least, agonizingly aware of the\neasy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few\nwords in the right key.\n\nAs soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host but the two or\nthree people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an\namazed way and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements\nthat I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table--the only place\nin the garden where a single man could linger without looking\npurposeless and alone.\n\nI was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when\nJordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble\nsteps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest\ndown into the garden.\n\nWelcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone\nbefore I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passers-by.\n\n\"Hello!\" I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturally\nloud across the garden.\n\n\"I thought you might be here,\" she responded absently as I came up.\n\"I remembered you lived next door to----\"\n\nShe held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she'd take care\nof me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses\nwho stopped at the foot of the steps.\n\n\"Hello!\" they cried together. \"Sorry you didn't win.\"\n\nThat was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week\nbefore.\n\n\"You don't know who we are,\" said one of the girls in yellow, \"but we\nmet you here about a month ago.\"\n\n\"You've dyed your hair since then,\" remarked Jordan, and I started\nbut the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the\npremature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer's\nbasket. With Jordan's slender golden arm resting in mine we descended\nthe steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated at\nus through the twilight and we sat down at a table with the two girls in\nyellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble.\n\n\"Do you come to these parties often?\" inquired Jordan of the girl\nbeside her.\n\n\"The last one was the one I met you at,\" answered the girl, in an alert,\nconfident voice. She turned to her companion: \"Wasn't it for you,\nLucille?\"\n\nIt was for Lucille, too.\n\n\"I like to come,\" Lucille said. \"I never care what I do, so I always have\na good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked\nme my name and address--inside of a week I got a package from Croirier's\nwith a new evening gown in it.\"\n\n\"Did you keep it?\" asked Jordan.\n\n\"Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the\nbust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two\nhundred and sixty-five dollars.\"\n\n\"There's something funny about a fellow that'll do a thing like that,\"\nsaid the other girl eagerly. \"He doesn't want any trouble with ANYbody.\"\n\n\"Who doesn't?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Gatsby. Somebody told me----\"\n\nThe two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.\n\n\"Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.\"\n\nA thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and\nlistened eagerly.\n\n\"I don't think it's so much THAT,\" argued Lucille skeptically; \"it's\nmore that he was a German spy during the war.\"\n\nOne of the men nodded in confirmation.\n\n\"I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in\nGermany,\" he assured us positively.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said the first girl, \"it couldn't be that, because he was in\nthe American army during the war.\" As our credulity switched back to\nher she leaned forward with enthusiasm. \"You look at him sometimes when\nhe thinks nobody's looking at him. I'll bet he killed a man.\"\n\nShe narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned and\nlooked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic speculation he\ninspired that there were whispers about him from those who found little\nthat it was necessary to whisper about in this world.\n\nThe first supper--there would be another one after midnight--was now\nbeing served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party who were\nspread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were\nthree married couples and Jordan's escort, a persistent undergraduate\ngiven to violent innuendo and obviously under the impression\nthat sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person\nto a greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling this party\nhad preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the\nfunction of representing the staid nobility of the countryside--East\nEgg condescending to West Egg, and carefully on guard against its\nspectroscopic gayety.\n\n\"Let's get out,\" whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and\ninappropriate half hour. \"This is much too polite for me.\"\n\nWe got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host--I\nhad never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The\nundergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.\n\nThe bar, where we glanced first, was crowded but Gatsby was not there.\nShe couldn't find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn't on the\nveranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked\ninto a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and\nprobably transported complete from some ruin overseas.\n\nA stout, middle-aged man with enormous owl-eyed spectacles was\nsitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with\nunsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he\nwheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.\n\n\"What do you think?\" he demanded impetuously.\n\n\"About what?\"\n\nHe waved his hand toward the book-shelves.\n\n\"About that. As a matter of fact you needn't bother to ascertain. I\nascertained. They're real.\"\n\n\"The books?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Absolutely real--have pages and everything. I thought they'd be a nice\ndurable cardboard. Matter of fact, they're absolutely real. Pages\nand--Here! Lemme show you.\"\n\nTaking our skepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and\nreturned with Volume One of the \"Stoddard Lectures.\"\n\n\"See!\" he cried triumphantly. \"It's a bona fide piece of printed matter.\nIt fooled me. This fella's a regular Belasco. It's a triumph. What\nthoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop too--didn't cut the pages.\nBut what do you want? What do you expect?\"\n\nHe snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf\nmuttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable\nto collapse.\n\n\"Who brought you?\" he demanded. \"Or did you just come? I was brought.\nMost people were brought.\"\n\nJordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully without answering.\n\n\"I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,\" he continued. \"Mrs. Claud\nRoosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I've\nbeen drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me\nup to sit in a library.\"\n\n\"Has it?\"\n\n\"A little bit, I think. I can't tell yet. I've only been here\nan hour. Did I tell you about the books? They're real. They're----\"\n\n\"You told us.\"\n\nWe shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.\n\nThere was dancing now on the canvas in the garden, old men pushing\nyoung girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples\nholding each other tortuously, fashionably and keeping in the\ncorners--and a great number of single girls dancing individualistically\nor relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or\nthe traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had\nsung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz and between\nthe numbers people were doing \"stunts\" all over the garden, while happy\nvacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage\n\"twins\"--who turned out to be the girls in yellow--did a baby act in\ncostume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger bowls.\nThe moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of\nsilver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the\nbanjoes on the lawn.\n\nI was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of\nabout my age and a rowdy little girl who gave way upon the slightest\nprovocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now. I\nhad taken two finger bowls of champagne and the scene had changed\nbefore my eyes into something significant, elemental and profound.\n\nAt a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.\n\n\"Your face is familiar,\" he said, politely. \"Weren't you in the Third\nDivision during the war?\"\n\n\"Why, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-Gun Battalion.\"\n\n\"I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I'd\nseen you somewhere before.\"\n\nWe talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France.\nEvidently he lived in this vicinity for he told me that he had just\nbought a hydroplane and was going to try it out in the morning.\n\n\"Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.\"\n\n\"What time?\"\n\n\"Any time that suits you best.\"\n\nIt was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around\nand smiled.\n\n\"Having a gay time now?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Much better.\" I turned again to my new acquaintance. \"This is an unusual\nparty for me. I haven't even seen the host. I live over there----\" I waved\nmy hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, \"and this man Gatsby sent\nover his chauffeur with an invitation.\"\n\nFor a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.\n\n\"I'm Gatsby,\" he said suddenly.\n\n\"What!\" I exclaimed. \"Oh, I beg your pardon.\"\n\n\"I thought you knew, old sport. I'm afraid I'm not a very good host.\"\n\nHe smiled understandingly--much more than understandingly. It was\none of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance\nin it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or\nseemed to face--the whole external world for an instant, and then\nconcentrated on YOU with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It\nunderstood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in\nyou as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it\nhad precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to\nconvey. Precisely at that point it vanished--and I was looking at an\nelegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate\nformality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he\nintroduced himself I'd got a strong impression that he was picking his\nwords with care.\n\nAlmost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler\nhurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on\nthe wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us\nin turn.\n\n\"If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,\" he urged me.\n\"Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.\"\n\nWhen he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan--constrained to assure her\nof my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and\ncorpulent person in his middle years.\n\n\"Who is he?\" I demanded. \"Do you know?\"\n\n\"He's just a man named Gatsby.\"\n\n\"Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?\"\n\n\"Now YOU're started on the subject,\" she answered with a wan smile.\n\"Well,--he told me once he was an Oxford man.\"\n\nA dim background started to take shape behind him but at her\nnext remark it faded away.\n\n\"However, I don't believe it.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she insisted, \"I just don't think he went there.\"\n\nSomething in her tone reminded me of the other girl's \"I think\nhe killed a man,\" and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I\nwould have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang\nfrom the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York.\nThat was comprehensible. But young men didn't--at least in my provincial\ninexperience I believed they didn't--drift coolly out of nowhere and buy\na palace on Long Island Sound.\n\n\"Anyhow he gives large parties,\" said Jordan, changing the subject\nwith an urbane distaste for the concrete. \"And I like large parties.\nThey're so intimate. At small parties there isn't any privacy.\"\n\nThere was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader\nrang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he cried. \"At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are\ngoing to play for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff's latest work which attracted\nso much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers\nyou know there was a big sensation.\" He smiled with jovial condescension\nand added \"Some sensation!\" whereupon everybody laughed.\n\n\"The piece is known,\" he concluded lustily, \"as 'Vladimir Tostoff's\nJazz History of the World.' \"\n\nThe nature of Mr. Tostoff's composition eluded me, because just as\nit began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps\nand looking from one group to another with approving eyes.\nHis tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and\nhis short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day. I could\nsee nothing sinister about him. I wondered if the fact that he was\nnot drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed\nto me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased.\nWhen the \"Jazz History of the World\" was over girls were putting\ntheir heads on men's shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were\nswooning backward playfully into men's arms, even into groups knowing\nthat some one would arrest their falls--but no one swooned backward on\nGatsby and no French bob touched Gatsby's shoulder and no singing\nquartets were formed with Gatsby's head for one link.\n\n\"I beg your pardon.\"\n\nGatsby's butler was suddenly standing beside us.\n\n\"Miss Baker?\" he inquired. \"I beg your pardon but Mr. Gatsby would like\nto speak to you alone.\"\n\n\"With me?\" she exclaimed in surprise.\n\n\"Yes, madame.\"\n\nShe got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment,\nand followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore\nher evening dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes--there\nwas a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to\nwalk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.\n\nI was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and\nintriguing sounds had issued from a long many-windowed room which\noverhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan's undergraduate who was now\nengaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who\nimplored me to join him, I went inside.\n\nThe large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was\nplaying the piano and beside her stood a tall, red haired young lady\nfrom a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of\nchampagne and during the course of her song she had decided ineptly\nthat everything was very very sad--she was not only singing, she was\nweeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with\ngasping broken sobs and then took up the lyric again in a quavering\nsoprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks--not freely, however, for when\nthey came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an\ninky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. A\nhumorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face\nwhereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair and went off into\na deep vinous sleep.\n\n\"She had a fight with a man who says he's her husband,\" explained a\ngirl at my elbow.\n\nI looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights\nwith men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan's party, the quartet\nfrom East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was\ntalking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife after\nattempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent\nway broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks--at intervals she\nappeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed \"You\npromised!\" into his ear.\n\nThe reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall was at\npresent occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant\nwives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised\nvoices.\n\n\"Whenever he sees I'm having a good time he wants to go home.\"\n\n\"Never heard anything so selfish in my life.\"\n\n\"We're always the first ones to leave.\"\n\n\"So are we.\"\n\n\"Well, we're almost the last tonight,\" said one of the men sheepishly.\n\"The orchestra left half an hour ago.\"\n\nIn spite of the wives' agreement that such malevolence was beyond\ncredibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were\nlifted kicking into the night.\n\nAs I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and\nJordan Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last word\nto her but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into\nformality as several people approached him to say goodbye.\n\nJordan's party were calling impatiently to her from the porch but she\nlingered for a moment to shake hands.\n\n\"I've just heard the most amazing thing,\" she whispered. \"How long were\nwe in there?\"\n\n\"Why,--about an hour.\"\n\n\"It was--simply amazing,\" she repeated abstractedly. \"But I swore\nI wouldn't tell it and here I am tantalizing you.\" She yawned\ngracefully in my face. \"Please come and see me. . . . Phone book.\n. . . Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard. . . . My aunt. . . .\"\nShe was hurrying off as she talked--her brown hand waved a\njaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door.\n\nRather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I\njoined the last of Gatsby's guests who were clustered around him. I\nwanted to explain that I'd hunted for him early in the evening and to\napologize for not having known him in the garden.\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" he enjoined me eagerly. \"Don't give it another\nthought, old sport.\" The familiar expression held no more familiarity\nthan the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. \"And don't forget\nwe're going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning at nine o'clock.\"\n\nThen the butler, behind his shoulder:\n\n\"Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.\"\n\n\"All right, in a minute. Tell them I'll be right there. . . . good\nnight.\"\n\n\"Good night.\"\n\n\"Good night.\" He smiled--and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant\nsignificance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired\nit all the time. \"Good night, old sport. . . . Good night.\"\n\nBut as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over.\nFifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and\ntumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side up but\nviolently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coup\u00e9 which had left Gatsby's\ndrive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the\ndetachment of the wheel which was now getting considerable attention from\nhalf a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as they had left their cars\nblocking the road a harsh discordant din from those in the rear had been\naudible for some time and added to the already violent confusion of\nthe scene.\n\nA man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in\nthe middle of the road, looking from the car to the tire and from the\ntire to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.\n\n\"See!\" he explained. \"It went in the ditch.\"\n\nThe fact was infinitely astonishing to him--and I recognized first the\nunusual quality of wonder and then the man--it was the late patron of\nGatsby's library.\n\n\"How'd it happen?\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I know nothing whatever about mechanics,\" he said decisively.\n\n\"But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?\"\n\n\"Don't ask me,\" said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter.\n\"I know very little about driving--next to nothing. It happened,\nand that's all I know.\"\n\n\"Well, if you're a poor driver you oughtn't to try driving at night.\"\n\n\"But I wasn't even trying,\" he explained indignantly, \"I wasn't even\ntrying.\"\n\nAn awed hush fell upon the bystanders.\n\n\"Do you want to commit suicide?\"\n\n\"You're lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even TRYing!\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" explained the criminal. \"I wasn't driving. There's\nanother man in the car.\"\n\nThe shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained\n\"Ah-h-h!\" as the door of the coup\u00e9 swung slowly open. The crowd--it was\nnow a crowd--stepped back involuntarily and when the door had opened wide\nthere was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale\ndangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the\nground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.\n\nBlinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant\ngroaning of the horns the apparition stood swaying for a moment before\nhe perceived the man in the duster.\n\n\"Wha's matter?\" he inquired calmly. \"Did we run outa gas?\"\n\n\"Look!\"\n\nHalf a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel--he stared\nat it for a moment and then looked upward as though he suspected that\nit had dropped from the sky.\n\n\"It came off,\" some one explained.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"At first I din' notice we'd stopped.\"\n\nA pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders\nhe remarked in a determined voice:\n\n\"Wonder'ff tell me where there's a gas'line station?\"\n\nAt least a dozen men, some of them little better off than he was,\nexplained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical\nbond.\n\n\"Back out,\" he suggested after a moment. \"Put her in reverse.\"\n\n\"But the WHEEL'S off!\"\n\nHe hesitated.\n\n\"No harm in trying,\" he said.\n\nThe caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and\ncut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a moon\nwas shining over Gatsby's house, making the night fine as before and\nsurviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. A\nsudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great\ndoors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host who\nstood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.\n\n\nReading over what I have written so far I see I have given the\nimpression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all\nthat absorbed me. On the contrary they were merely casual events in a\ncrowded summer and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less\nthan my personal affairs.\n\nMost of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my shadow\nwestward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the\nProbity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their\nfirst names and lunched with them in dark crowded restaurants on\nlittle pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I even had a short\naffair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the\naccounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my\ndirection so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow\nquietly away.\n\nI took dinner usually at the Yale Club--for some reason it was the\ngloomiest event of my day--and then I went upstairs to the library and\nstudied investments and securities for a conscientious hour.\nThere were generally a few rioters around but they never came into the\nlibrary so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was\nmellow I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel\nand over Thirty-third Street to the Pennsylvania Station.\n\nI began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night\nand the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and\nmachines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and\npick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few\nminutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever\nknow or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their\napartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled\nback at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the\nenchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes,\nand felt it in others--poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows\nwaiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner--young clerks\nin the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.\n\nAgain at eight o'clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were five\ndeep with throbbing taxi cabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a\nsinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited,\nand voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted\ncigarettes outlined unintelligible gestures inside. Imagining that\nI, too, was hurrying toward gayety and sharing their intimate\nexcitement, I wished them well.\n\nFor a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found\nher again. At first I was flattered to go places with her because she\nwas a golf champion and every one knew her name. Then it was\nsomething more. I wasn't actually in love, but I felt a sort of\ntender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the\nworld concealed something--most affectations conceal something\neventually, even though they don't in the beginning--and one day I found\nwhat it was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she\nleft a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied\nabout it--and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded\nme that night at Daisy's. At her first big golf tournament there was a\nrow that nearly reached the newspapers--a suggestion that she had moved\nher ball from a bad lie in the semi-final round. The thing approached\nthe proportions of a scandal--then died away. A caddy retracted his\nstatement and the only other witness admitted that he might have been\nmistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.\n\nJordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw\nthat this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence\nfrom a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest.\nShe wasn't able to endure being at a disadvantage, and given this\nunwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she\nwas very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the\nworld and yet satisfy the demands of her hard jaunty body.\n\nIt made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never\nblame deeply--I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that\nsame house party that we had a curious conversation about driving a\ncar. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our\nfender flicked a button on one man's coat.\n\n\"You're a rotten driver,\" I protested. \"Either you ought to be more\ncareful or you oughtn't to drive at all.\"\n\n\"I am careful.\"\n\n\"No, you're not.\"\n\n\"Well, other people are,\" she said lightly.\n\n\"What's that got to do with it?\"\n\n\"They'll keep out of my way,\" she insisted. \"It takes two to make an\naccident.\"\n\n\"Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.\"\n\n\"I hope I never will,\" she answered. \"I hate careless people. That's why\nI like you.\"\n\nHer grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had\ndeliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved\nher. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes\non my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of\nthat tangle back home. I'd been writing letters once a week and signing\nthem: \"Love, Nick,\" and all I could think of was how, when that certain\ngirl played tennis, a faint mustache of perspiration appeared on her\nupper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be\ntactfully broken off before I was free.\n\nEvery one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and\nthis is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n\n\nOn Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages along shore\nthe world and its mistress returned to Gatsby's house and twinkled\nhilariously on his lawn.\n\n\"He's a bootlegger,\" said the young ladies, moving somewhere between\nhis cocktails and his flowers. \"One time he killed a man who had found out\nthat he was nephew to von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil.\nReach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there crystal\nglass.\"\n\nOnce I wrote down on the empty spaces of a time-table the names\nof those who came to Gatsby's house that summer. It is an old time-table\nnow, disintegrating at its folds and headed \"This schedule in effect\nJuly 5th, 1922.\" But I can still read the grey names and they will give\nyou a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted\nGatsby's hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing\nwhatever about him.\n\nFrom East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches and a\nman named Bunsen whom I knew at Yale and Doctor Webster Civet who\nwas drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie\nVoltaires and a whole clan named Blackbuck who always gathered in a\ncorner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near.\nAnd the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr.\nChrystie's wife) and Edgar Beaver, whose hair they say turned\ncotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.\n\nClarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only\nonce, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named\nEtty in the garden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles\nand the O. R. P. Schraeders and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of\nGeorgia and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there\nthree days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the\ngravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett's automobile ran over his right\nhand. The Dancies came too and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over\nsixty, and Maurice A. Flink and the Hammerheads and Beluga the\ntobacco importer and Beluga's girls.\n\nFrom West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and\nCecil Schoen and Gulick the state senator and Newton Orchid who\ncontrolled Films Par Excellence and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don\nS. Schwartze (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the\nmovies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G.\nEarl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife.\nDa Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B.\n(\"Rot-Gut\") Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly--they came to\ngamble and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was\ncleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably\nnext day.\n\nA man named Klipspringer was there so often and so long that he became\nknown as \"the boarder\"--I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical\npeople there were Gus Waize and Horace O'Donavan and Lester Meyer and\nGeorge Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes\nand the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the\nCorrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W.\nBelcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry\nL. Palmetto who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train\nin Times Square.\n\nBenny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite\nthe same ones in physical person but they were so identical one with\nanother that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have\nforgotten their names--Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela or Gloria\nor Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names\nof flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American\ncapitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves to\nbe.\n\nIn addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O'Brien came\nthere at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer who had\nhis nose shot off in the war and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his\nfianc\u00e9e, and Ardita Fitz-Peters, and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of the\nAmerican Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip with a man reputed to be her\nchauffeur, and a prince of something whom we called Duke and whose name,\nif I ever knew it, I have forgotten.\n\nAll these people came to Gatsby's house in the summer.\n\n\nAt nine o'clock, one morning late in July Gatsby's gorgeous car\nlurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody\nfrom its three noted horn. It was the first time he had called on me\nthough I had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane,\nand, at his urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach.\n\n\"Good morning, old sport. You're having lunch with me today and I\nthought we'd ride up together.\"\n\nHe was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that\nresourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American--that comes,\nI suppose, with the absence of lifting work or rigid sitting in youth\nand, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games.\nThis quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in\nthe shape of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a\ntapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.\n\nHe saw me looking with admiration at his car.\n\n\"It's pretty, isn't it, old sport.\" He jumped off to give me a better\nview. \"Haven't you ever seen it before?\"\n\nI'd seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream color, bright\nwith nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with\ntriumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a\nlabyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind\nmany layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory we started\nto town.\n\nI had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and\nfound, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first\nimpression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had\ngradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate\nroadhouse next door.\n\nAnd then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn't reached West Egg\nvillage before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished\nand slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-colored\nsuit.\n\n\"Look here, old sport,\" he broke out surprisingly. \"What's your opinion\nof me, anyhow?\"\n\nA little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which\nthat question deserves.\n\n\"Well, I'm going to tell you something about my life,\" he interrupted.\n\"I don't want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you\nhear.\"\n\nSo he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavored conversation in\nhis halls.\n\n\"I'll tell you God's truth.\" His right hand suddenly ordered divine\nretribution to stand by. \"I am the son of some wealthy people in the\nmiddle-west--all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at\nOxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years.\nIt is a family tradition.\"\n\nHe looked at me sideways--and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was\nlying. He hurried the phrase \"educated at Oxford,\" or swallowed it or\nchoked on it as though it had bothered him before. And with this doubt\nhis whole statement fell to pieces and I wondered if there wasn't\nsomething a little sinister about him after all.\n\n\"What part of the middle-west?\" I inquired casually.\n\n\"San Francisco.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\n\"My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.\"\n\nHis voice was solemn as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan\nstill haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg\nbut a glance at him convinced me otherwise.\n\n\"After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of\nEurope--Paris, Venice, Rome--collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting\nbig game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to\nforget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.\"\n\nWith an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very\nphrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a\nturbaned \"character\" leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a\ntiger through the Bois de Boulogne.\n\n\"Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief and I tried very\nhard to die but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a\ncommission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I\ntook two machine-gun detachments so far forward that there was a half\nmile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn't advance. We\nstayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty men with\nsixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last they found\nthe insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead. I was\npromoted to be a major and every Allied government gave me a\ndecoration--even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic\nSea!\"\n\nLittle Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them--with\nhis smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro's troubled history and\nsympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It\nappreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had\nelicited this tribute from Montenegro's warm little heart. My\nincredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming\nhastily through a dozen magazines.\n\nHe reached in his pocket and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon, fell\ninto my palm.\n\n\"That's the one from Montenegro.\"\n\nTo my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look.\n\n_Orderi di Danilo_, ran the circular legend, _Montenegro, Nicolas Rex_.\n\n\"Turn it.\"\n\n_Major Jay Gatsby_, I read, _For Valour Extraordinary_.\n\n\"Here's another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It was\ntaken in Trinity Quad--the man on my left is now the Earl of Dorcaster.\"\n\nIt was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an\narchway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby,\nlooking a little, not much, younger--with a cricket bat in his hand.\n\nThen it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace\non the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with\ntheir crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.\n\n\"I'm going to make a big request of you today,\" he said, pocketing his\nsouvenirs with satisfaction, \"so I thought you ought to know something\nabout me. I didn't want you to think I was just some nobody. You see,\nI usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there\ntrying to forget the sad thing that happened to me.\" He hesitated.\n\"You'll hear about it this afternoon.\"\n\n\"At lunch?\"\n\n\"No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you're taking Miss Baker\nto tea.\"\n\n\"Do you mean you're in love with Miss Baker?\"\n\n\"No, old sport, I'm not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak\nto you about this matter.\"\n\nI hadn't the faintest idea what \"this matter\" was, but I was more\nannoyed than interested. I hadn't asked Jordan to tea in order to discuss\nMr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something utterly\nfantastic and for a moment I was sorry I'd ever set foot upon his\noverpopulated lawn.\n\nHe wouldn't say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared\nthe city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of\nred-belted ocean-going ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with\nthe dark, undeserted saloons of the faded gilt nineteen-hundreds. Then\nthe valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a glimpse\nof Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we\nwent by.\n\nWith fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half\nAstoria--only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the\nelevated I heard the familiar \"jug--jug--SPAT!\" of a motor cycle, and a\nfrantic policeman rode alongside.\n\n\"All right, old sport,\" called Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a white\ncard from his wallet he waved it before the man's eyes.\n\n\"Right you are,\" agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. \"Know you next\ntime, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse ME!\"\n\n\"What was that?\" I inquired.  \"The picture of Oxford?\"\n\n\"I was able to do the commissioner a favor once, and he sends me a\nChristmas card every year.\"\n\nOver the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a\nconstant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the\nriver in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of\nnon-olfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always\nthe city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the\nmystery and the beauty in the world.\n\nA dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two\ncarriages with drawn blinds and by more cheerful carriages for\nfriends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short\nupper lips of south-eastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of\nGatsby's splendid car was included in their somber holiday. As we\ncrossed Blackwell's Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white\nchauffeur, in which sat three modish Negroes, two bucks and a girl. I\nlaughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in\nhaughty rivalry.\n\n\"Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge,\" I thought;\n\"anything at all. . . .\"\n\nEven Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.\n\n\nRoaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby\nfor lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside my eyes\npicked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.\n\n\"Mr. Carraway this is my friend Mr. Wolfsheim.\"\n\nA small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two\nfine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I\ndiscovered his tiny eyes in the half darkness.\n\n\"--so I took one look at him--\" said Mr. Wolfsheim, shaking my hand\nearnestly, \"--and what do you think I did?\"\n\n\"What?\" I inquired politely.\n\nBut evidently he was not addressing me for he dropped my hand and\ncovered Gatsby with his expressive nose.\n\n\"I handed the money to Katspaugh and I sid, 'All right, Katspaugh,\ndon't pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.' He shut it then and\nthere.\"\n\nGatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the\nrestaurant whereupon Mr. Wolfsheim swallowed a new sentence he was\nstarting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.\n\n\"Highballs?\" asked the head waiter.\n\n\"This is a nice restaurant here,\" said Mr. Wolfsheim looking at the\nPresbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. \"But I like across the street better!\"\n\n\"Yes, highballs,\" agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfsheim: \"It's too hot\nover there.\"\n\n\"Hot and small--yes,\" said Mr. Wolfsheim, \"but full of memories.\"\n\n\"What place is that?\" I asked.\n\n\"The old Metropole.\n\n\"The old Metropole,\" brooded Mr. Wolfsheim gloomily. \"Filled with faces\ndead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can't forget so\nlong as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It was six of us\nat the table and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening. When it was\nalmost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says\nsomebody wants to speak to him outside. 'All right,' says Rosy and begins\nto get up and I pulled him down in his chair.\n\n\" 'Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don't you,\nso help me, move outside this room.'\n\n\"It was four o'clock in the morning then, and if we'd of raised the blinds\nwe'd of seen daylight.\"\n\n\"Did he go?\" I asked innocently.\n\n\"Sure he went,\"--Mr. Wolfsheim's nose flashed at me indignantly--\"He\nturned around in the door and says, 'Don't let that waiter take away\nmy coffee!' Then he went out on the sidewalk and they shot him\nthree times in his full belly and drove away.\"\n\n\"Four of them were electrocuted,\" I said, remembering.\n\n\"Five with Becker.\" His nostrils turned to me in an interested way.\n\"I understand you're looking for a business gonnegtion.\"\n\nThe juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered\nfor me:\n\n\"Oh, no,\" he exclaimed, \"this isn't the man!\"\n\n\"No?\" Mr. Wolfsheim seemed disappointed.\n\n\"This is just a friend. I told you we'd talk about that some other\ntime.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. Wolfsheim, \"I had a wrong man.\"\n\nA succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfsheim, forgetting the more\nsentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with\nferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the\nroom--he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly\nbehind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have taken one\nshort glance beneath our own table.\n\n\"Look here, old sport,\" said Gatsby, leaning toward me, \"I'm afraid I\nmade you a little angry this morning in the car.\"\n\nThere was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.\n\n\"I don't like mysteries,\" I answered. \"And I don't understand why you\nwon't come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got to\ncome through Miss Baker?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing underhand,\" he assured me. \"Miss Baker's a great\nsportswoman, you know, and she'd never do anything that wasn't all right.\"\n\nSuddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up and hurried from the room\nleaving me with Mr. Wolfsheim at the table.\n\n\"He has to telephone,\" said Mr. Wolfsheim, following him with his eyes.\n\"Fine fellow, isn't he? Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"He's an Oggsford man.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?\"\n\n\"I've heard of it.\"\n\n\"It's one of the most famous colleges in the world.\"\n\n\"Have you known Gatsby for a long time?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Several years,\" he answered in a gratified way. \"I made the pleasure of\nhis acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a man of\nfine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to myself: 'There's\nthe kind of man you'd like to take home and introduce to your mother and\nsister.' \" He paused. \"I see you're looking at my cuff buttons.\"\n\nI hadn't been looking at them, but I did now.  They were composed of\noddly familiar pieces of ivory.\n\n\"Finest specimens of human molars,\" he informed me.\n\n\"Well!\" I inspected them. \"That's a very interesting idea.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. \"Yeah, Gatsby's very\ncareful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend's wife.\"\n\nWhen the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat\ndown Mr. Wolfsheim drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet.\n\n\"I have enjoyed my lunch,\" he said, \"and I'm going to run off from you\ntwo young men before I outstay my welcome.\"\n\n\"Don't hurry, Meyer,\" said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfsheim\nraised his hand in a sort of benediction.\n\n\"You're very polite but I belong to another generation,\" he announced\nsolemnly. \"You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and\nyour----\" He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his\nhand--\"As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won't impose myself\non you any longer.\"\n\nAs he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling.\nI wondered if I had said anything to offend him.\n\n\"He becomes very sentimental sometimes,\" explained Gatsby. \"This is one of\nhis sentimental days. He's quite a character around New York--a denizen of\nBroadway.\"\n\n\"Who is he anyhow--an actor?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"A dentist?\"\n\n\"Meyer Wolfsheim? No, he's a gambler.\" Gatsby hesitated, then added\ncoolly: \"He's the man who fixed the World's Series back in 1919.\"\n\n\"Fixed the World's Series?\" I repeated.\n\nThe idea staggered me. I remembered of course that the World's Series\nhad been fixed in 1919 but if I had thought of it at all I would have\nthought of it as a thing that merely HAPPENED, the end of some\ninevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could start to\nplay with the faith of fifty million people--with the single-mindedness\nof a burglar blowing a safe.\n\n\"How did he happen to do that?\" I asked after a minute.\n\n\"He just saw the opportunity.\"\n\n\"Why isn't he in jail?\"\n\n\"They can't get him, old sport. He's a smart man.\"\n\nI insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I caught\nsight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.\n\n\"Come along with me for a minute,\" I said. \"I've got to say hello\nto someone.\"\n\nWhen he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our\ndirection.\n\n\"Where've you been?\" he demanded eagerly. \"Daisy's furious because you\nhaven't called up.\"\n\n\"This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.\"\n\nThey shook hands briefly and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment\ncame over Gatsby's face.\n\n\"How've you been, anyhow?\" demanded Tom of me. \"How'd you happen to come\nup this far to eat?\"\n\n\"I've been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.\"\n\nI turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.\n\n\nOne October day in nineteen-seventeen----\n(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight\nchair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)\n--I was walking along from one place to another half on the sidewalks and\nhalf on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from\nEngland with rubber nobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground.\nI had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind and\nwhenever this happened the red, white and blue banners in front of all\nthe houses stretched out stiff and said TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT in a disapproving\nway.\n\nThe largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to\nDaisy Fay's house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and\nby far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She\ndressed in white, and had a little white roadster and all day long\nthe telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp\nTaylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night, \"anyways,\nfor an hour!\"\n\nWhen I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside\nthe curb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen\nbefore. They were so engrossed in each other that she didn't see me until\nI was five feet away.\n\n\"Hello Jordan,\" she called unexpectedly. \"Please come here.\"\n\nI was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older\ngirls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and\nmake bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn't come\nthat day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way\nthat every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it\nseemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since. His name\nwas Jay Gatsby and I didn't lay eyes on him again for over four\nyears--even after I'd met him on Long Island I didn't realize it was the\nsame man.\n\nThat was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux myself,\nand I began to play in tournaments, so I didn't see Daisy very often.\nShe went with a slightly older crowd--when she went with anyone at all.\nWild rumors were circulating about her--how her mother had found her\npacking her bag one winter night to go to New York and say goodbye to a\nsoldier who was going overseas. She was effectually prevented, but she\nwasn't on speaking terms with her family for several weeks. After\nthat she didn't play around with the soldiers any more but only\nwith a few flat-footed, short-sighted young men in town who couldn't\nget into the army at all.\n\nBy the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a debut\nafter the Armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a\nman from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago with\nmore pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He came\ndown with a hundred people in four private cars and hired a whole\nfloor of the Seelbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave her\na string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\n\nI was bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the bridal\ndinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in\nher flowered dress--and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle of\nsauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.\n\n\" 'Gratulate me,\" she muttered. \"Never had a drink before but oh, how I do\nenjoy it.\"\n\n\"What's the matter, Daisy?\"\n\nI was scared, I can tell you; I'd never seen a girl like that before.\n\n\"Here, dearis.\" She groped around in a waste-basket she had with her\non the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. \"Take 'em downstairs and\ngive 'em back to whoever they belong to. Tell 'em all Daisy's change' her\nmine. Say 'Daisy's change' her mine!'.\"\n\nShe began to cry--she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her\nmother's maid and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath. She\nwouldn't let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her and\nsqueezed it up into a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the\nsoap dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.\n\nBut she didn't say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and put\nice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress and half an\nhour later when we walked out of the room the pearls were around her\nneck and the incident was over. Next day at five o'clock she married Tom\nBuchanan without so much as a shiver and started off on a three months'\ntrip to the South Seas.\n\nI saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back and I thought I'd\nnever seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he left the room for a\nminute she'd look around uneasily and say \"Where's Tom gone?\" and\nwear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the\ndoor. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour\nrubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable\ndelight. It was touching to see them together--it made you laugh in a\nhushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I left Santa\nBarbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night and ripped\na front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got into the\npapers too because her arm was broken--she was one of the chambermaids\nin the Santa Barbara Hotel.\n\nThe next April Daisy had her little girl and they went to France for a\nyear. I saw them one spring in Cannes and later in Deauville and then\nthey came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in Chicago,\nas you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich\nand wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation.\nPerhaps because she doesn't drink. It's a great advantage not to drink\namong hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and, moreover,\nyou can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else\nis so blind that they don't see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in\nfor amour at all--and yet there's something in that voice of hers. . . .\n\nWell, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time\nin years. It was when I asked you--do you remember?--if you knew Gatsby\nin West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me\nup, and said \"What Gatsby?\" and when I described him--I was half\nasleep--she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used\nto know. It wasn't until then that I connected this Gatsby with the\nofficer in her white car.\n\n\nWhen Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza\nfor half an hour and were driving in a Victoria through Central Park.\nThe sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in\nthe West Fifties and the clear voices of girls, already gathered like\ncrickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:\n\n\n    \"I'm the Sheik of Araby,\n    Your love belongs to me.\n    At night when you're asleep,\n    Into your tent I'll creep----\"\n\n\n\"It was a strange coincidence,\" I said.\n\n\"But it wasn't a coincidence at all.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.\"\n\nThen it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired\non that June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the\nwomb of his purposeless splendor.\n\n\"He wants to know--\" continued Jordan \"--if you'll invite Daisy to your\nhouse some afternoon and then let him come over.\"\n\nThe modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and bought a\nmansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths so that he could\n\"come over\" some afternoon to a stranger's garden.\n\n\"Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?\"\n\n\"He's afraid. He's waited so long. He thought you might be offended.\nYou see he's a regular tough underneath it all.\"\n\nSomething worried me.\n\n\"Why didn't he ask you to arrange a meeting?\"\n\n\"He wants her to see his house,\" she explained. \"And your house is right\nnext door.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties,\nsome night,\" went on Jordan, \"but she never did. Then he began asking\npeople casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found.\nIt was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have\nheard the elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately\nsuggested a luncheon in New York--and I thought he'd go mad:\n\n\" 'I don't want to do anything out of the way!' he kept saying. 'I want to\nsee her right next door.'\n\n\"When I said you were a particular friend of Tom's he started to abandon\nthe whole idea. He doesn't know very much about Tom, though he says he's\nread a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse\nof Daisy's name.\"\n\nIt was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm\naround Jordan's golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to\ndinner. Suddenly I wasn't thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more but of\nthis clean, hard, limited person who dealt in universal skepticism and\nwho leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm. A phrase began\nto beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: \"There are only the\npursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.\"\n\n\"And Daisy ought to have something in her life,\" murmured Jordan to me.\n\n\"Does she want to see Gatsby?\"\n\n\"She's not to know about it. Gatsby doesn't want her to know. You're\njust supposed to invite her to tea.\"\n\nWe passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the facade of Fifty-ninth\nStreet, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park.\nUnlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan I had no girl whose disembodied face\nfloated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so I drew up the\ngirl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth smiled and so\nI drew her up again, closer, this time to my face.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n\n\nWhen I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that\nmy house was on fire. Two o'clock and the whole corner of the peninsula\nwas blazing with light which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin\nelongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a corner I saw that it\nwas Gatsby's house, lit from tower to cellar.\n\nAt first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved\nitself into \"hide-and-go-seek\" or \"sardines-in-the-box\" with all the\nhouse thrown open to the game. But there wasn't a sound. Only wind in\nthe trees which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again\nas if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned away I\nsaw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.\n\n\"Your place looks like the world's fair,\" I said.\n\n\"Does it?\" He turned his eyes toward it absently. \"I have been glancing\ninto some of the rooms. Let's go to Coney Island, old sport. In my car.\"\n\n\"It's too late.\"\n\n\"Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven't made use\nof it all summer.\"\n\n\"I've got to go to bed.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nHe waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.\n\n\"I talked with Miss Baker,\" I said after a moment. \"I'm going to call up\nDaisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" he said carelessly. \"I don't want to put you to\nany trouble.\"\n\n\"What day would suit you?\"\n\n\"What day would suit YOU?\" he corrected me quickly. \"I don't want to put\nyou to any trouble, you see.\"\n\n\"How about the day after tomorrow?\" He considered for a moment. Then,\nwith reluctance:\n\n\"I want to get the grass cut,\" he said.\n\nWe both looked at the grass--there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn\nended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I suspected that\nhe meant my grass.\n\n\"There's another little thing,\" he said uncertainly, and hesitated.\n\n\"Would you rather put it off for a few days?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, it isn't about that. At least----\" He fumbled with a series of\nbeginnings. \"Why, I thought--why, look here, old sport, you don't make\nmuch money, do you?\"\n\n\"Not very much.\"\n\nThis seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.\n\n\"I thought you didn't, if you'll pardon my--you see, I carry on a\nlittle business on the side, a sort of sideline, you understand. And I\nthought that if you don't make very much--You're selling bonds, aren't\nyou, old sport?\"\n\n\"Trying to.\"\n\n\"Well, this would interest you. It wouldn't take up much of your\ntime and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be\na rather confidential sort of thing.\"\n\nI realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might\nhave been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer was\nobviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no choice\nexcept to cut him off there.\n\n\"I've got my hands full,\" I said. \"I'm much obliged but I couldn't take\non any more work.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't have to do any business with Wolfsheim.\" Evidently he\nthought that I was shying away from the \"gonnegtion\" mentioned at lunch,\nbut I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer, hoping I'd\nbegin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went\nunwillingly home.\n\nThe evening had made me light-headed and happy; I think I walked into a\ndeep sleep as I entered my front door. So I didn't know whether or not\nGatsby went to Coney Island or for how many hours he \"glanced into\nrooms\" while his house blazed gaudily on. I called up Daisy from the\noffice next morning and invited her to come to tea.\n\n\"Don't bring Tom,\" I warned her.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Don't bring Tom.\"\n\n\"Who is 'Tom'?\" she asked innocently.\n\nThe day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven o'clock a man in a\nraincoat dragging a lawn-mower tapped at my front door and said that\nMr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I\nhad forgotten to tell my Finn to come back so I drove into West Egg\nVillage to search for her among soggy white-washed alleys and to buy\nsome cups and lemons and flowers.\n\nThe flowers were unnecessary, for at two o'clock a greenhouse arrived\nfrom Gatsby's, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour\nlater the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel\nsuit, silver shirt and gold-colored tie hurried in. He was pale and\nthere were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.\n\n\"Is everything all right?\" he asked immediately.\n\n\"The grass looks fine, if that's what you mean.\"\n\n\"What grass?\" he inquired blankly. \"Oh, the grass in the yard.\" He looked\nout the window at it, but judging from his expression I don't believe\nhe saw a thing.\n\n\"Looks very good,\" he remarked vaguely. \"One of the papers said they\nthought the rain would stop about four. I think it was 'The Journal.' Have\nyou got everything you need in the shape of--of tea?\"\n\nI took him into the pantry where he looked a little reproachfully at the\nFinn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen\nshop.\n\n\"Will they do?\" I asked.\n\n\"Of course, of course! They're fine!\" and he added hollowly, \". . .old\nsport.\"\n\nThe rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist through which\noccasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes\nthrough a copy of Clay's \"Economics,\" starting at the Finnish tread that\nshook the kitchen floor and peering toward the bleared windows from time\nto time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking\nplace outside. Finally he got up and informed me in an uncertain voice\nthat he was going home.\n\n\"Why's that?\"\n\n\"Nobody's coming to tea. It's too late!\" He looked at his watch as if\nthere was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. \"I can't wait\nall day.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly; it's just two minutes to four.\"\n\nHe sat down, miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously there\nwas the sound of a motor turning into my lane. We both jumped up and,\na little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.\n\nUnder the dripping bare lilac trees a large open car was coming up the\ndrive. It stopped. Daisy's face, tipped sideways beneath a\nthree-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic\nsmile.\n\n\"Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?\"\n\nThe exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had\nto follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone\nbefore any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of\nblue paint across her cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as\nI took it to help her from the car.\n\n\"Are you in love with me,\" she said low in my ear. \"Or why did I have\nto come alone?\"\n\n\"That's the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far\naway and spend an hour.\"\n\n\"Come back in an hour, Ferdie.\" Then in a grave murmur, \"His name is\nFerdie.\"\n\n\"Does the gasoline affect his nose?\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" she said innocently. \"Why?\"\n\nWe went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living room was deserted.\n\n\"Well, that's funny!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"What's funny?\"\n\nShe turned her head as there was a light, dignified knocking at the front\ndoor. I went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands\nplunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of\nwater glaring tragically into my eyes.\n\nWith his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the\nhall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire and disappeared into the\nliving room. It wasn't a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of my own\nheart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.\n\nFor half a minute there wasn't a sound. Then from the living room I\nheard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh followed by Daisy's\nvoice on a clear artificial note.\n\n\"I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.\"\n\nA pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall so I went\ninto the room.\n\nGatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the\nmantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom.\nHis head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a\ndefunct mantelpiece clock and from this position his distraught eyes\nstared down at Daisy who was sitting frightened but graceful on the\nedge of a stiff chair.\n\n\"We've met before,\" muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily at\nme and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily\nthe clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his\nhead, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers and set\nit back in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the\nsofa and his chin in his hand.\n\n\"I'm sorry about the clock,\" he said.\n\nMy own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldn't muster up\na single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.\n\n\"It's an old clock,\" I told them idiotically.\n\nI think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on\nthe floor.\n\n\"We haven't met for many years,\" said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact\nas it could ever be.\n\n\"Five years next November.\"\n\nThe automatic quality of Gatsby's answer set us all back at least another\nminute. I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that\nthey help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in\non a tray.\n\nAmid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency\nestablished itself. Gatsby got himself into a shadow and while Daisy\nand I talked looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with\ntense unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn't an end in itself I\nmade an excuse at the first possible moment and got to my feet.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.\n\n\"I'll be back.\"\n\n\"I've got to speak to you about something before you go.\"\n\nHe followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door and whispered:\n\"Oh, God!\" in a miserable way.\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"This is a terrible mistake,\" he said, shaking his head from side to\nside, \"a terrible, terrible mistake.\"\n\n\"You're just embarrassed, that's all,\" and luckily I added: \"Daisy's\nembarrassed too.\"\n\n\"She's embarrassed?\" he repeated incredulously.\n\n\"Just as much as you are.\"\n\n\"Don't talk so loud.\"\n\n\"You're acting like a little boy,\" I broke out impatiently. \"Not only\nthat but you're rude. Daisy's sitting in there all alone.\"\n\n\nHe raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable\nreproach and opening the door cautiously went back into the other room.\n\nI walked out the back way--just as Gatsby had when he had made his\nnervous circuit of the house half an hour before--and ran for a huge\nblack knotted tree whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain.\nOnce more it was pouring and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by\nGatsby's gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric\nmarshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree except\nGatsby's enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church\nsteeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the \"period\"\ncraze, a decade before, and there was a story that he'd agreed to pay\nfive years' taxes on all the neighboring cottages if the owners would\nhave their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the\nheart out of his plan to Found a Family--he went into an immediate\ndecline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the\ndoor. Americans, while occasionally willing to be serfs, have always\nbeen obstinate about being peasantry.\n\nAfter half an hour the sun shone again and the grocer's automobile\nrounded Gatsby's drive with the raw material for his servants' dinner--I\nfelt sure he wouldn't eat a spoonful. A maid began opening the upper\nwindows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from a\nlarge central bay, spat meditatively into the garden. It was time I\nwent back. While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of\ntheir voices, rising and swelling a little, now and then, with gusts of\nemotion. But in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen within\nthe house too.\n\nI went in--after making every possible noise in the kitchen short of\npushing over the stove--but I don't believe they heard a sound. They\nwere sitting at either end of the couch looking at each other as if\nsome question had been asked or was in the air, and every vestige of\nembarrassment was gone. Daisy's face was smeared with tears and when I\ncame in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before\na mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding.\nHe literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new\nwell-being radiated from him and filled the little room.\n\n\"Oh, hello, old sport,\" he said, as if he hadn't seen me for years. I\nthought for a moment he was going to shake hands.\n\n\"It's stopped raining.\"\n\n\"Has it?\" When he realized what I was talking about, that there were\ntwinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man,\nlike an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to\nDaisy. \"What do you think of that? It's stopped raining.\"\n\n\"I'm glad, Jay.\" Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only\nof her unexpected joy.\n\n\"I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,\" he said, \"I'd like to\nshow her around.\"\n\n\"You're sure you want me to come?\"\n\n\"Absolutely, old sport.\"\n\nDaisy went upstairs to wash her face--too late I thought with humiliation\nof my towels--while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.\n\n\"My house looks well, doesn't it?\" he demanded. \"See how the whole\nfront of it catches the light.\"\n\nI agreed that it was splendid.\n\n\"Yes.\" His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. \"It took\nme just three years to earn the money that bought it.\"\n\n\"I thought you inherited your money.\"\n\n\"I did, old sport,\" he said automatically, \"but I lost most of it in\nthe big panic--the panic of the war.\"\n\nI think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what\nbusiness he was in he answered \"That's my affair,\" before he realized\nthat it wasn't the appropriate reply.\n\n\"Oh, I've been in several things,\" he corrected himself. \"I was in the\ndrug business and then I was in the oil business. But I'm not in either\none now.\" He looked at me with more attention. \"Do you mean you've been\nthinking over what I proposed the other night?\"\n\nBefore I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass\nbuttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.\n\n\"That huge place THERE?\" she cried pointing.\n\n\"Do you like it?\"\n\n\"I love it, but I don't see how you live there all alone.\"\n\n\"I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People who\ndo interesting things. Celebrated people.\"\n\nInstead of taking the short cut along the Sound we went down the road and\nentered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this\naspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the\ngardens, the sparkling odor of jonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn\nand plum blossoms and the pale gold odor of kiss-me-at-the-gate.\nIt was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright\ndresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the\ntrees.\n\nAnd inside as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music rooms and\nRestoration salons I felt that there were guests concealed behind\nevery couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we\nhad passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of \"the Merton College\nLibrary\" I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into\nghostly laughter.\n\nWe went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender\nsilk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing rooms and poolrooms,\nand bathrooms with sunken baths--intruding into one chamber where a\ndishevelled man in pajamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It\nwas Mr. Klipspringer, the \"boarder.\" I had seen him wandering hungrily\nabout the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby's own apartment,\na bedroom and a bath and an Adam study, where we sat down and drank a\nglass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall.\n\nHe hadn't once ceased looking at Daisy and I think he revalued\neverything in his house according to the measure of response it drew\nfrom her well-loved eyes. Sometimes, too, he stared around at his\npossessions in a dazed way as though in her actual and astounding\npresence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a\nflight of stairs.\n\nHis bedroom was the simplest room of all--except where the dresser was\ngarnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush\nwith delight and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and\nshaded his eyes and began to laugh.\n\n\"It's the funniest thing, old sport,\" he said hilariously. \"I can't--when\nI try to----\"\n\nHe had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third.\nAfter his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with\nwonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed it\nright through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak, at an\ninconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction, he was running\ndown like an overwound clock.\n\nRecovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent\ncabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and\nhis shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.\n\n\"I've got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection\nof things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.\"\n\nHe took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one\nbefore us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel\nwhich lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in\nmany-colored disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft\nrich heap mounted higher--shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in\ncoral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange with monograms of\nIndian blue. Suddenly with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into\nthe shirts and began to cry stormily.\n\n\"They're such beautiful shirts,\" she sobbed, her voice muffled in the\nthick folds. \"It makes me sad because I've never seen such--such beautiful\nshirts before.\"\n\n\nAfter the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and the\nhydroplane and the midsummer flowers--but outside Gatsby's window it\nbegan to rain again so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated\nsurface of the Sound.\n\n\"If it wasn't for the mist we could see your home across the bay,\" said\nGatsby. \"You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of\nyour dock.\"\n\nDaisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed\nin what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the\ncolossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared\nto the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed\nvery near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star\nto the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of\nenchanted objects had diminished by one.\n\nI began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in\nthe half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting\ncostume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.\n\n\"Who's this?\"\n\n\"That? That's Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.\"\n\nThe name sounded faintly familiar.\n\n\"He's dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.\"\n\nThere was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the\nbureau--Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly--taken apparently\nwhen he was about eighteen.\n\n\"I adore it!\" exclaimed Daisy. \"The pompadour! You never told me you had\na pompadour--or a yacht.\"\n\n\"Look at this,\" said Gatsby quickly. \"Here's a lot of clippings--about\nyou.\"\n\nThey stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the rubies\nwhen the phone rang and Gatsby took up the receiver.\n\n\"Yes. . . . Well, I can't talk now. . . . I can't talk now, old\nsport. . . . I said a SMALL town. . . . He must know what a small town\nis. . . . Well, he's no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small\ntown. . . .\"\n\nHe rang off.\n\n\"Come here QUICK!\" cried Daisy at the window.\n\nThe rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west,\nand there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.\n\n\"Look at that,\" she whispered, and then after a moment: \"I'd like to\njust get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you\naround.\"\n\nI tried to go then, but they wouldn't hear of it; perhaps my presence\nmade them feel more satisfactorily alone.\n\n\"I know what we'll do,\" said Gatsby, \"we'll have Klipspringer play the\npiano.\"\n\nHe went out of the room calling \"Ewing!\" and returned in a few\nminutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man with\nshell-rimmed glasses and scanty blonde hair. He was now decently clothed\nin a \"sport shirt\" open at the neck, sneakers and duck trousers of a\nnebulous hue.\n\n\"Did we interrupt your exercises?\" inquired Daisy politely.\n\n\"I was asleep,\" cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment.\n\"That is, I'd BEEN asleep. Then I got up. . . .\"\n\n\"Klipspringer plays the piano,\" said Gatsby, cutting him off. \"Don't you,\nEwing, old sport?\"\n\n\"I don't play well. I don't--I hardly play at all. I'm all out of\nprac----\"\n\n\"We'll go downstairs,\" interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The\ngrey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.\n\nIn the music room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano. He\nlit Daisy's cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on\na couch far across the room where there was no light save what the\ngleaming floor bounced in from the hall.\n\nWhen Klipspringer had played \"The Love Nest\" he turned around on the\nbench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.\n\n\"I'm all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn't play. I'm all\nout of prac----\"\n\n\"Don't talk so much, old sport,\" commanded Gatsby. \"Play!\"\n\n\n    IN THE MORNING,\n    IN THE EVENING,\n       AIN'T WE GOT FUN----\n\nOutside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the\nSound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains,\nmen-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York. It was\nthe hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating on\nthe air.\n\n\n    ONE THING'S SURE AND NOTHING'S SURER\n    THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET--CHILDREN.\n       IN THE MEANTIME,\n       IN BETWEEN TIME----\n\n\nAs I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of bewilderment\nhad come back into Gatsby's face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to\nhim as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost five\nyears! There must have been moments even that afternoon when\nDaisy tumbled short of his dreams--not through her own fault but\nbecause of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond\nher, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative\npassion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright\nfeather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can\nchallenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.\n\nAs I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took\nhold of hers and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward\nher with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most with its\nfluctuating, feverish warmth because it couldn't be over-dreamed--that\nvoice was a deathless song.\n\nThey had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand;\nGatsby didn't know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they\nlooked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I went out\nof the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there\ntogether.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n\n\nAbout this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one\nmorning at Gatsby's door and asked him if he had anything to say.\n\n\"Anything to say about what?\" inquired Gatsby politely.\n\n\"Why,--any statement to give out.\"\n\nIt transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard\nGatsby's name around his office in a connection which he either\nwouldn't reveal or didn't fully understand. This was his day off\nand with laudable initiative he had hurried out \"to see.\"\n\nIt was a random shot, and yet the reporter's instinct was right. Gatsby's\nnotoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his\nhospitality and so become authorities on his past, had increased\nall summer until he fell just short of being news. Contemporary\nlegends such as the \"underground pipe-line to Canada\" attached\nthemselves to him, and there was one persistent story that he\ndidn't live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house\nand was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore. Just why\nthese inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North\nDakota, isn't easy to say.\n\nJames Gatz--that was really, or at least legally, his name. He had\nchanged it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that\nwitnessed the beginning of his career--when he saw Dan Cody's yacht drop\nanchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior. It was James Gatz\nwho had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green\njersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby who\nborrowed a row-boat, pulled out to the TUOLOMEE and informed Cody that\na wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour.\n\nI suppose he'd had the name ready for a long time, even then. His\nparents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people--his imagination had\nnever really accepted them as his parents at all. The truth was that\nJay Gatsby, of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic\nconception of himself. He was a son of God--a phrase which, if it means\nanything, means just that--and he must be about His Father's Business,\nthe service of a vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty. So he invented\njust the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be\nlikely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.\n\nFor over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of\nLake Superior as a clam digger and a salmon fisher or in any other\ncapacity that brought him food and bed. His brown, hardening body lived\nnaturally through the half fierce, half lazy work of the bracing days.\nHe knew women early and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous\nof them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of the others\nbecause they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming\nself-absorption he took for granted.\n\nBut his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque\nand fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe\nof ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the\nclock ticked on the wash-stand and the moon soaked with wet\nlight his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the\npattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid\nscene with an oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an\noutlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the\nunreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded\nsecurely on a fairy's wing.\n\nAn instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to\nthe small Lutheran college of St. Olaf in southern Minnesota. He stayed\nthere two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of\nhis destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor's work with\nwhich he was to pay his way through. Then he drifted back to Lake\nSuperior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day\nthat Dan Cody's yacht dropped anchor in the shallows along shore.\n\nCody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields,\nof the Yukon, of every rush for metal since Seventy-five. The\ntransactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire\nfound him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and,\nsuspecting this an infinite number of women tried to separate him from\nhis money. The none too savory ramifications by which Ella Kaye, the\nnewspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him\nto sea in a yacht, were common knowledge to the turgid journalism\nof 1902. He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five\nyears when he turned up as James Gatz's destiny at Little Girl Bay.\n\nTo the young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed\ndeck, the yacht represented all the beauty and glamor in the world. I\nsuppose he smiled at Cody--he had probably discovered that people liked\nhim when he smiled. At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of\nthem elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick, and\nextravagantly ambitious. A few days later he took him to Duluth and\nbought him a blue coat, six pair of white duck trousers and a yachting\ncap. And when the TUOLOMEE left for the West Indies and the Barbary\nCoast Gatsby left too.\n\nHe was employed in a vague personal capacity--while he remained with\nCody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor,\nfor Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be\nabout and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more\ntrust in Gatsby. The arrangement lasted five years during which the\nboat went three times around the continent. It might have lasted\nindefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night\nin Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died.\n\nI remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby's bedroom, a grey, florid\nman with a hard empty face--the pioneer debauchee who during one phase\nof American life brought back to the eastern seaboard the savage\nviolence of the frontier brothel and saloon. It was indirectly due to\nCody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gay parties\nwomen used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the\nhabit of letting liquor alone.\n\nAnd it was from Cody that he inherited money--a legacy of twenty-five\nthousand dollars. He didn't get it. He never understood the legal\ndevice that was used against him but what remained of the millions\nwent intact to Ella Kaye. He was left with his singularly appropriate\neducation; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the\nsubstantiality of a man.\n\n\nHe told me all this very much later, but I've put it down here with the\nidea of exploding those first wild rumors about his antecedents, which\nweren't even faintly true. Moreover he told it to me at a time of\nconfusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and\nnothing about him. So I take advantage of this short halt, while\nGatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of\nmisconceptions away.\n\nIt was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. For\nseveral weeks I didn't see him or hear his voice on the phone--mostly\nI was in New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to\ningratiate myself with her senile aunt--but finally I went over to\nhis house one Sunday afternoon. I hadn't been there two minutes when\nsomebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink. I was startled,\nnaturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadn't happened\nbefore.\n\nThey were a party of three on horseback--Tom and a man named Sloane and\na pretty woman in a brown riding habit who had been there previously.\n\n\"I'm delighted to see you,\" said Gatsby standing on his porch.\n\"I'm delighted that you dropped in.\"\n\nAs though they cared!\n\n\"Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.\" He walked around the room\nquickly, ringing bells. \"I'll have something to drink for you in just\na minute.\"\n\nHe was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But he would be\nuneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in a vague\nway that that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted nothing. A\nlemonade? No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at all,\nthanks. . . . I'm sorry----\n\n\"Did you have a nice ride?\"\n\n\"Very good roads around here.\"\n\n\"I suppose the automobiles----\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nMoved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom who had accepted\nthe introduction as a stranger.\n\n\"I believe we've met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Tom, gruffly polite but obviously not remembering.\n\"So we did. I remember very well.\"\n\n\"About two weeks ago.\"\n\n\"That's right. You were with Nick here.\"\n\n\"I know your wife,\" continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.\n\n\"That so?\"\n\nTom turned to me.\n\n\"You live near here, Nick?\"\n\n\"Next door.\"\n\n\"That so?\"\n\nMr. Sloane didn't enter into the conversation but lounged back haughtily\nin his chair; the woman said nothing either--until unexpectedly, after\ntwo highballs, she became cordial.\n\n\"We'll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,\" she suggested.\n\"What do you say?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I'd be delighted to have you.\"\n\n\"Be ver' nice,\" said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. \"Well--think ought to\nbe starting home.\"\n\n\"Please don't hurry,\" Gatsby urged them. He had control of himself now\nand he wanted to see more of Tom. \"Why don't you--why don't you stay for\nsupper? I wouldn't be surprised if some other people dropped in from\nNew York.\"\n\n\"You come to supper with ME,\" said the lady enthusiastically.\n\"Both of you.\"\n\nThis included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.\n\n\"Come along,\" he said--but to her only.\n\n\"I mean it,\" she insisted. \"I'd love to have you. Lots of room.\"\n\nGatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn't see\nthat Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn't.\n\n\"I'm afraid I won't be able to,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you come,\" she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.\n\nMr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.\n\n\"We won't be late if we start now,\" she insisted aloud.\n\n\"I haven't got a horse,\" said Gatsby. \"I used to ride in the army but\nI've never bought a horse. I'll have to follow you in my car. Excuse me\nfor just a minute.\"\n\nThe rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began\nan impassioned conversation aside.\n\n\"My God, I believe the man's coming,\" said Tom. \"Doesn't he know she\ndoesn't want him?\"\n\n\"She says she does want him.\"\n\n\"She has a big dinner party and he won't know a soul there.\" He frowned.\n\"I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be\nold-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to\nsuit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.\"\n\nSuddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted\ntheir horses.\n\n\"Come on,\" said Mr. Sloane to Tom, \"we're late. We've got to go.\" And then\nto me: \"Tell him we couldn't wait, will you?\"\n\nTom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod and\nthey trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August\nfoliage just as Gatsby with hat and light overcoat in hand came out\nthe front door.\n\nTom was evidently perturbed at Daisy's running around alone, for on the\nfollowing Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby's party. Perhaps\nhis presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness--it\nstands out in my memory from Gatsby's other parties that summer. There\nwere the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same\nprofusion of champagne, the same many-colored, many-keyed commotion,\nbut I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that\nhadn't been there before. Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it,\ngrown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own\nstandards and its own great figures, second to nothing because it had\nno consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at it again,\nthrough Daisy's eyes. It is invariably saddening to look through new\neyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of\nadjustment.\n\nThey arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among the sparkling\nhundreds Daisy's voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.\n\n\"These things excite me SO,\" she whispered. \"If you want to kiss me\nany time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I'll be glad\nto arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card.\nI'm giving out green----\"\n\n\"Look around,\" suggested Gatsby.\n\n\"I'm looking around. I'm having a marvelous----\"\n\n\"You must see the faces of many people you've heard about.\"\n\nTom's arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.\n\n\"We don't go around very much,\" he said. \"In fact I was just thinking\nI don't know a soul here.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you know that lady.\" Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely human\norchid of a woman who sat in state under a white plum tree. Tom and Daisy\nstared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the\nrecognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.\n\n\"She's lovely,\" said Daisy.\n\n\"The man bending over her is her director.\"\n\nHe took them ceremoniously from group to group:\n\n\"Mrs. Buchanan . . . and Mr. Buchanan----\" After an instant's hesitation\nhe added: \"the polo player.\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" objected Tom quickly, \"Not me.\"\n\nBut evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained \"the polo\nplayer\" for the rest of the evening.\n\n\"I've never met so many celebrities!\" Daisy exclaimed. \"I liked that\nman--what was his name?--with the sort of blue nose.\"\n\nGatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.\n\n\"Well, I liked him anyhow.\"\n\n\"I'd a little rather not be the polo player,\" said Tom pleasantly, \"I'd\nrather look at all these famous people in--in oblivion.\"\n\nDaisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful,\nconservative fox-trot--I had never seen him dance before. Then they\nsauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour while\nat her request I remained watchfully in the garden: \"In case there's a\nfire or a flood,\" she explained, \"or any act of God.\"\n\nTom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together.\n\"Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?\" he said. \"A fellow's\ngetting off some funny stuff.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" answered Daisy genially, \"And if you want to take down any\naddresses here's my little gold pencil. . . .\" She looked around after\na moment and told me the girl was \"common but pretty,\" and I knew that\nexcept for the half hour she'd been alone with Gatsby she wasn't having\na good time.\n\nWe were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault--Gatsby had\nbeen called to the phone and I'd enjoyed these same people only two\nweeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now.\n\n\"How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?\"\n\nThe girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my\nshoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.\n\n\"Wha?\"\n\nA massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf\nwith her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker's defence:\n\n\"Oh, she's all right now. When she's had five or six cocktails she always\nstarts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it alone.\"\n\n\"I do leave it alone,\" affirmed the accused hollowly.\n\n\"We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: 'There's somebody\nthat needs your help, Doc.' \"\n\n\"She's much obliged, I'm sure,\" said another friend, without gratitude.\n\"But you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool.\"\n\n\"Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,\" mumbled Miss\nBaedeker. \"They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.\"\n\n\"Then you ought to leave it alone,\" countered Doctor Civet.\n\n\"Speak for yourself!\" cried Miss Baedeker violently. \"Your hand shakes.\nI wouldn't let you operate on me!\"\n\nIt was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with\nDaisy and watching the moving picture director and his Star. They were\nstill under the white plum tree and their faces were touching except\nfor a pale thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he\nhad been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this\nproximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate degree\nand kiss at her cheek.\n\n\"I like her,\" said Daisy, \"I think she's lovely.\"\n\nBut the rest offended her--and inarguably, because it wasn't a gesture but\nan emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented \"place\"\nthat Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village--appalled\nby its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too\nobtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short cut from nothing\nto nothing. She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed\nto understand.\n\nI sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car. It\nwas dark here in front: only the bright door sent ten square feet of\nlight volleying out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a shadow\nmoved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow,\nan indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an\ninvisible glass.\n\n\"Who is this Gatsby anyhow?\" demanded Tom suddenly. \"Some big bootlegger?\"\n\n\"Where'd you hear that?\" I inquired.\n\n\"I didn't hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are\njust big bootleggers, you know.\"\n\n\"Not Gatsby,\" I said shortly.\n\nHe was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under his\nfeet.\n\n\"Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie\ntogether.\"\n\nA breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy's fur collar.\n\n\"At least they're more interesting than the people we know,\" she said\nwith an effort.\n\n\"You didn't look so interested.\"\n\n\"Well, I was.\"\n\nTom laughed and turned to me.\n\n\"Did you notice Daisy's face when that girl asked her to put her under\na cold shower?\"\n\nDaisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper,\nbringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had\nbefore and would never have again. When the melody rose, her voice\nbroke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and\neach change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.\n\n\"Lots of people come who haven't been invited,\" she said suddenly.\n\"That girl hadn't been invited. They simply force their way in and he's\ntoo polite to object.\"\n\n\"I'd like to know who he is and what he does,\" insisted Tom. \"And I think\nI'll make a point of finding out.\"\n\n\"I can tell you right now,\" she answered. \"He owned some drug stores,\na lot of drug stores. He built them up himself.\"\n\nThe dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.\n\n\"Good night, Nick,\" said Daisy.\n\nHer glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps where\n\"Three o'Clock in the Morning,\" a neat, sad little waltz of that year,\nwas drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of\nGatsby's party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from\nher world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling\nher back inside? What would happen now in the dim incalculable hours?\nPerhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare\nand to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with\none fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would blot\nout those five years of unwavering devotion.\n\n\nI stayed late that night. Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free\nand I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run\nup, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights were\nextinguished in the guest rooms overhead. When he came down the steps at\nlast the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes\nwere bright and tired.\n\n\"She didn't like it,\" he said immediately.\n\n\"Of course she did.\"\n\n\"She didn't like it,\" he insisted. \"She didn't have a good time.\"\n\nHe was silent and I guessed at his unutterable depression.\n\n\"I feel far away from her,\" he said. \"It's hard to make her understand.\"\n\n\"You mean about the dance?\"\n\n\"The dance?\" He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of\nhis fingers. \"Old sport, the dance is unimportant.\"\n\nHe wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say:\n\"I never loved you.\" After she had obliterated three years with that\nsentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken.\nOne of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back to\nLouisville and be married from her house--just as if it were five\nyears ago.\n\n\"And she doesn't understand,\" he said. \"She used to be able to\nunderstand. We'd sit for hours----\"\n\nHe broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds\nand discarded favors and crushed flowers.\n\n\"I wouldn't ask too much of her,\" I ventured. \"You can't repeat the past.\"\n\n\"Can't repeat the past?\" he cried incredulously. \"Why of course you can!\"\n\nHe looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the\nshadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.\n\n\"I'm going to fix everything just the way it was before,\" he said,\nnodding determinedly. \"She'll see.\"\n\nHe talked a lot about the past and I gathered that he wanted to recover\nsomething, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy.\nHis life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could\nonce return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he\ncould find out what that thing was. . . .\n\n. . . One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down\nthe street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where\nthere were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight.\nThey stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night\nwith that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of\nthe year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the\ndarkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the\ncorner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalk really\nformed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees--he could\nclimb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the\npap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.\n\nHis heart beat faster and faster as Daisy's white face came up to his\nown. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his\nunutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp\nagain like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer\nto the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed\nher. At his lips' touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the\nincarnation was complete.\n\nThrough all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was\nreminded of something--an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that\nI had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to\ntake shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man's, as though\nthere was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But\nthey made no sound and what I had almost remembered was\nuncommunicable forever.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\n\n\nIt was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights\nin his house failed to go on one Saturday night--and, as obscurely as it\nhad begun, his career as Trimalchio was over.\n\nOnly gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned\nexpectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove\nsulkily away. Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out--an\nunfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously\nfrom the door.\n\n\"Is Mr. Gatsby sick?\"\n\n\"Nope.\" After a pause he added \"sir\" in a dilatory, grudging way.\n\n\"I hadn't seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr. Carraway\ncame over.\"\n\n\"Who?\" he demanded rudely.\n\n\"Carraway.\"\n\n\"Carraway. All right, I'll tell him.\" Abruptly he slammed the door.\n\nMy Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his\nhouse a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never\nwent into West Egg Village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered\nmoderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that the\nkitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village was\nthat the new people weren't servants at all.\n\nNext day Gatsby called me on the phone.\n\n\"Going away?\" I inquired.\n\n\"No, old sport.\"\n\n\"I hear you fired all your servants.\"\n\n\"I wanted somebody who wouldn't gossip. Daisy comes over quite often--in\nthe afternoons.\"\n\nSo the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the\ndisapproval in her eyes.\n\n\"They're some people Wolfsheim wanted to do something for. They're all\nbrothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nHe was calling up at Daisy's request--would I come to lunch at\nher house tomorrow? Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later\nDaisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was coming.\nSomething was up. And yet I couldn't believe that they would choose\nthis occasion for a scene--especially for the rather harrowing scene\nthat Gatsby had outlined in the garden.\n\nThe next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of\nthe summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the\nhot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush\nat noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion;\nthe woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white\nshirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers,\nlapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry. Her pocket-book\nslapped to the floor.\n\n\"Oh, my!\" she gasped.\n\nI picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it\nat arm's length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that\nI had no designs upon it--but every one near by, including the woman,\nsuspected me just the same.\n\n\"Hot!\" said the conductor to familiar faces. \"Some weather! Hot! Hot! Hot!\nIs it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it . . . ?\"\n\nMy commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand.\nThat any one should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed,\nwhose head made damp the pajama pocket over his heart!\n\n. . . Through the hall of the Buchanans' house blew a faint wind,\ncarrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we\nwaited at the door.\n\n\"The master's body!\" roared the butler into the mouthpiece. \"I'm sorry,\nmadame, but we can't furnish it--it's far too hot to touch this noon!\"\n\nWhat he really said was: \"Yes . . . yes . . . I'll see.\"\n\nHe set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to take\nour stiff straw hats.\n\n\"Madame expects you in the salon!\" he cried, needlessly indicating the\ndirection. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the\ncommon store of life.\n\nThe room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and\nJordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols, weighing down\ntheir own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.\n\n\"We can't move,\" they said together.\n\nJordan's fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in\nmine.\n\n\"And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?\" I inquired.\n\nSimultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall\ntelephone.\n\nGatsby stood in the center of the crimson carpet and gazed around with\nfascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting\nlaugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.\n\n\"The rumor is,\" whispered Jordan, \"that that's Tom's girl on the\ntelephone.\"\n\nWe were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance.\n\"Very well, then, I won't sell you the car at all. . . . I'm\nunder no obligations to you at all. . . . And as for your bothering me\nabout it at lunch time I won't stand that at all!\"\n\n\"Holding down the receiver,\" said Daisy cynically.\n\n\"No, he's not,\" I assured her. \"It's a bona fide deal. I happen to\nknow about it.\"\n\nTom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his\nthick body, and hurried into the room.\n\n\"Mr. Gatsby!\" He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed\ndislike. \"I'm glad to see you, sir. . . . Nick. . . .\"\n\n\"Make us a cold drink,\" cried Daisy.\n\nAs he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled\nhis face down kissing him on the mouth.\n\n\"You know I love you,\" she murmured.\n\n\"You forget there's a lady present,\" said Jordan.\n\nDaisy looked around doubtfully.\n\n\"You kiss Nick too.\"\n\n\"What a low, vulgar girl!\"\n\n\"I don't care!\" cried Daisy and began to clog on the brick fireplace.\nThen she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as\na freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.\n\n\"Bles-sed pre-cious,\" she crooned, holding out her arms. \"Come to your\nown mother that loves you.\"\n\nThe child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and rooted\nshyly into her mother's dress.\n\n\"The Bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy\nhair? Stand up now, and say How-de-do.\"\n\nGatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand.\nAfterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don't think he had\never really believed in its existence before.\n\n\"I got dressed before luncheon,\" said the child, turning eagerly to\nDaisy.\n\n\"That's because your mother wanted to show you off.\" Her face bent into\nthe single wrinkle of the small white neck. \"You dream, you. You absolute\nlittle dream.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" admitted the child calmly. \"Aunt Jordan's got on a white\ndress too.\"\n\n\"How do you like mother's friends?\" Daisy turned her around so that she\nfaced Gatsby. \"Do you think they're pretty?\"\n\n\"Where's Daddy?\"\n\n\"She doesn't look like her father,\" explained Daisy. \"She looks like me.\nShe's got my hair and shape of the face.\"\n\nDaisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held\nout her hand.\n\n\"Come, Pammy.\"\n\n\"Goodbye, sweetheart!\"\n\nWith a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her\nnurse's hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back,\npreceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.\n\nGatsby took up his drink.\n\n\"They certainly look cool,\" he said, with visible tension.\n\nWe drank in long greedy swallows.\n\n\"I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter every year,\" said Tom\ngenially. \"It seems that pretty soon the earth's going to fall into the\nsun--or wait a minute--it's just the opposite--the sun's getting colder\nevery year.\n\n\"Come outside,\" he suggested to Gatsby, \"I'd like you to have a look at\nthe place.\"\n\nI went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in the\nheat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea. Gatsby's eyes\nfollowed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay.\n\n\"I'm right across from you.\"\n\n\"So you are.\"\n\nOur eyes lifted over the rosebeds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse\nof the dog days along shore. Slowly the white wings of the boat moved\nagainst the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and\nthe abounding blessed isles.\n\n\"There's sport for you,\" said Tom, nodding. \"I'd like to be out there\nwith him for about an hour.\"\n\nWe had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened, too, against the heat,\nand drank down nervous gayety with the cold ale.\n\n\"What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon,\" cried Daisy, \"and the\nday after that, and the next thirty years?\"\n\n\"Don't be morbid,\" Jordan said. \"Life starts all over again when it gets\ncrisp in the fall.\"\n\n\"But it's so hot,\" insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, \"And\neverything's so confused. Let's all go to town!\"\n\nHer voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding its\nsenselessness into forms.\n\n\"I've heard of making a garage out of a stable,\" Tom was saying to\nGatsby, \"but I'm the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.\"\n\n\"Who wants to go to town?\" demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby's eyes\nfloated toward her. \"Ah,\" she cried, \"you look so cool.\"\n\nTheir eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space.\nWith an effort she glanced down at the table.\n\n\"You always look so cool,\" she repeated.\n\nShe had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was\nastounded. His mouth opened a little and he looked at Gatsby and then\nback at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as some one he knew a\nlong time ago.\n\n\"You resemble the advertisement of the man,\" she went on innocently.\n\"You know the advertisement of the man----\"\n\n\"All right,\" broke in Tom quickly, \"I'm perfectly willing to go to\ntown. Come on--we're all going to town.\"\n\nHe got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife.\nNo one moved.\n\n\"Come on!\" His temper cracked a little. \"What's the matter, anyhow?\nIf we're going to town let's start.\"\n\nHis hand, trembling with his effort at self control, bore to his lips the\nlast of his glass of ale. Daisy's voice got us to our feet and out on\nto the blazing gravel drive.\n\n\"Are we just going to go?\" she objected. \"Like this? Aren't we going to\nlet any one smoke a cigarette first?\"\n\n\"Everybody smoked all through lunch.\"\n\n\"Oh, let's have fun,\" she begged him. \"It's too hot to fuss.\"\n\nHe didn't answer.\n\n\"Have it your own way,\" she said. \"Come on, Jordan.\"\n\nThey went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling\nthe hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon hovered already\nin the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not\nbefore Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.\n\n\"Have you got your stables here?\" asked Gatsby with an effort.\n\n\"About a quarter of a mile down the road.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"I don't see the idea of going to town,\" broke out Tom savagely.\n\"Women get these notions in their heads----\"\n\n\"Shall we take anything to drink?\" called Daisy from an upper window.\n\n\"I'll get some whiskey,\" answered Tom. He went inside.\n\nGatsby turned to me rigidly:\n\n\"I can't say anything in his house, old sport.\"\n\n\"She's got an indiscreet voice,\" I remarked. \"It's full of----\"\n\nI hesitated.\n\n\"Her voice is full of money,\" he said suddenly.\n\nThat was it. I'd never understood before. It was full of money--that was\nthe inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the\ncymbals' song of it. . . . High in a white palace the king's daughter,\nthe golden girl. . . .\n\nTom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed\nby Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and\ncarrying light capes over their arms.\n\n\"Shall we all go in my car?\" suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green\nleather of the seat. \"I ought to have left it in the shade.\"\n\n\"Is it standard shift?\" demanded Tom.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, you take my coup\u00e9 and let me drive your car to town.\"\n\nThe suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.\n\n\"I don't think there's much gas,\" he objected.\n\n\"Plenty of gas,\" said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge.\n\"And if it runs out I can stop at a drug store. You can buy anything at a\ndrug store nowadays.\"\n\nA pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom\nfrowning and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar\nand vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in words,\npassed over Gatsby's face.\n\n\"Come on, Daisy,\" said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby's\ncar. \"I'll take you in this circus wagon.\"\n\nHe opened the door but she moved out from the circle of his arm.\n\n\"You take Nick and Jordan. We'll follow you in the coup\u00e9.\"\n\nShe walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan and\nTom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby's car, Tom pushed the\nunfamiliar gears tentatively and we shot off into the oppressive heat\nleaving them out of sight behind.\n\n\"Did you see that?\" demanded Tom.\n\n\"See what?\"\n\nHe looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known all\nalong.\n\n\"You think I'm pretty dumb, don't you?\" he suggested. \"Perhaps I am, but\nI have a--almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do.\nMaybe you don't believe that, but science----\"\n\nHe paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back from\nthe edge of the theoretical abyss.\n\n\"I've made a small investigation of this fellow,\" he continued. \"I could\nhave gone deeper if I'd known----\"\n\n\"Do you mean you've been to a medium?\" inquired Jordan humorously.\n\n\"What?\" Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. \"A medium?\"\n\n\"About Gatsby.\"\n\n\"About Gatsby! No, I haven't. I said I'd been making a small\ninvestigation of his past.\"\n\n\"And you found he was an Oxford man,\" said Jordan helpfully.\n\n\"An Oxford man!\" He was incredulous. \"Like hell he is! He wears a\npink suit.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless he's an Oxford man.\"\n\n\"Oxford, New Mexico,\" snorted Tom contemptuously, \"or something like\nthat.\"\n\n\"Listen, Tom. If you're such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?\"\ndemanded Jordan crossly.\n\n\"Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married--God knows\nwhere!\"\n\nWe were all irritable now with the fading ale and, aware of it,\nwe drove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg's faded\neyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby's caution about\ngasoline.\n\n\"We've got enough to get us to town,\" said Tom.\n\n\"But there's a garage right here,\" objected Jordan. \"I don't want to get\nstalled in this baking heat.\"\n\nTom threw on both brakes impatiently and we slid to an abrupt\ndusty stop under Wilson's sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged\nfrom the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.\n\n\"Let's have some gas!\" cried Tom roughly. \"What do you think we stopped\nfor--to admire the view?\"\n\n\"I'm sick,\" said Wilson without moving. \"I been sick all day.\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"I'm all run down.\"\n\n\"Well, shall I help myself?\" Tom demanded. \"You sounded well enough\non the phone.\"\n\nWith an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and,\nbreathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his face\nwas green.\n\n\"I didn't mean to interrupt your lunch,\" he said. \"But I need money\npretty bad and I was wondering what you were going to do with your\nold car.\"\n\n\"How do you like this one?\" inquired Tom. \"I bought it last week.\"\n\n\"It's a nice yellow one,\" said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.\n\n\"Like to buy it?\"\n\n\"Big chance,\" Wilson smiled faintly. \"No, but I could make some money\non the other.\"\n\n\"What do you want money for, all of a sudden?\"\n\n\"I've been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to\ngo west.\"\n\n\"Your wife does!\" exclaimed Tom, startled.\n\n\"She's been talking about it for ten years.\" He rested for a moment\nagainst the pump, shading his eyes. \"And now she's going whether she wants\nto or not. I'm going to get her away.\"\n\nThe coup\u00e9 flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a\nwaving hand.\n\n\"What do I owe you?\" demanded Tom harshly.\n\n\"I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,\" remarked\nWilson. \"That's why I want to get away. That's why I been bothering you\nabout the car.\"\n\n\"What do I owe you?\"\n\n\"Dollar twenty.\"\n\nThe relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had\na bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions\nhadn't alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some\nsort of life apart from him in another world and the shock had\nmade him physically sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made\na parallel discovery less than an hour before--and it occurred to me\nthat there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so\nprofound as the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so\nsick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty--as if he had just got\nsome poor girl with child.\n\n\"I'll let you have that car,\" said Tom. \"I'll send it over tomorrow\nafternoon.\"\n\nThat locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad\nglare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been\nwarned of something behind. Over the ashheaps the giant eyes of\nDoctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil but I perceived, after\na moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity\nfrom less than twenty feet away.\n\nIn one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside\na little and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So engrossed\nwas she that she had no consciousness of being observed and one\nemotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly\ndeveloping picture. Her expression was curiously familiar--it was an\nexpression I had often seen on women's faces but on Myrtle Wilson's\nface it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her\neyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan\nBaker, whom she took to be his wife.\n\n\nThere is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we\ndrove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his\nmistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping\nprecipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the\naccelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving\nWilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour,\nuntil, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of\nthe easygoing blue coup\u00e9.\n\n\"Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,\" suggested Jordan.\n\"I love New York on summer afternoons when every one's away. There's\nsomething very sensuous about it--overripe, as if all sorts of funny\nfruits were going to fall into your hands.\"\n\nThe word \"sensuous\" had the effect of further disquieting Tom but before\nhe could invent a protest the coup\u00e9 came to a stop and Daisy signalled us\nto draw up alongside.\n\n\"Where are we going?\" she cried.\n\n\"How about the movies?\"\n\n\"It's so hot,\" she complained. \"You go. We'll ride around and meet you\nafter.\" With an effort her wit rose faintly, \"We'll meet you on some\ncorner. I'll be the man smoking two cigarettes.\"\n\n\"We can't argue about it here,\" Tom said impatiently as a truck gave\nout a cursing whistle behind us. \"You follow me to the south side of\nCentral Park, in front of the Plaza.\"\n\nSeveral times he turned his head and looked back for their car,\nand if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into\nsight. I think he was afraid they would dart down a side street and out\nof his life forever.\n\nBut they didn't. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging\nthe parlor of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.\n\nThe prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into\nthat room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the\ncourse of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my\nlegs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back. The\nnotion originated with Daisy's suggestion that we hire five bathrooms\nand take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as \"a place to\nhave a mint julep.\" Each of us said over and over that it was a \"crazy\nidea\"--we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or\npretended to think, that we were being very funny. . . .\n\nThe room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four\no'clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from\nthe Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us,\nfixing her hair.\n\n\"It's a swell suite,\" whispered Jordan respectfully and every one\nlaughed.\n\n\"Open another window,\" commanded Daisy, without turning around.\n\n\"There aren't any more.\"\n\n\"Well, we'd better telephone for an axe----\"\n\n\"The thing to do is to forget about the heat,\" said Tom impatiently.\n\"You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.\"\n\nHe unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the towel and put it on the table.\n\n\"Why not let her alone, old sport?\" remarked Gatsby. \"You're the one that\nwanted to come to town.\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its nail\nand splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered \"Excuse me\"--but\nthis time no one laughed.\n\n\"I'll pick it up,\" I offered.\n\n\"I've got it.\" Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered \"Hum!\" in an\ninterested way, and tossed the book on a chair.\n\n\"That's a great expression of yours, isn't it?\" said Tom sharply.\n\n\"What is?\"\n\n\"All this 'old sport' business. Where'd you pick that up?\"\n\n\"Now see here, Tom,\" said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, \"if\nyou're going to make personal remarks I won't stay here a minute. Call\nup and order some ice for the mint julep.\"\n\nAs Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and\nwe were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn's Wedding March\nfrom the ballroom below.\n\n\"Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!\" cried Jordan dismally.\n\n\"Still--I was married in the middle of June,\" Daisy remembered,\n\"Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?\"\n\n\"Biloxi,\" he answered shortly.\n\n\"A man named Biloxi. 'Blocks' Biloxi, and he made boxes--that's a\nfact--and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.\"\n\n\"They carried him into my house,\" appended Jordan, \"because we lived\njust two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy\ntold him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died.\" After a\nmoment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, \"There\nwasn't any connection.\"\n\n\"I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,\" I remarked.\n\n\"That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left.\nHe gave me an aluminum putter that I use today.\"\n\nThe music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated\nin at the window, followed by intermittent cries of \"Yea--ea--ea!\"\nand finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.\n\n\"We're getting old,\" said Daisy. \"If we were young we'd rise and dance.\"\n\n\"Remember Biloxi,\" Jordan warned her. \"Where'd you know him, Tom?\"\n\n\"Biloxi?\" He concentrated with an effort. \"I didn't know him. He was a\nfriend of Daisy's.\"\n\n\"He was not,\" she denied. \"I'd never seen him before. He came down in\nthe private car.\"\n\n\"Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville.\nAsa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room\nfor him.\"\n\nJordan smiled.\n\n\"He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of\nyour class at Yale.\"\n\nTom and I looked at each other blankly.\n\n\"BilOxi?\"\n\n\"First place, we didn't have any president----\"\n\nGatsby's foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.\n\n\"By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you're an Oxford man.\"\n\n\"Not exactly.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.\"\n\n\"Yes--I went there.\"\n\nA pause. Then Tom's voice, incredulous and insulting:\n\n\"You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.\"\n\nAnother pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but\nthe silence was unbroken by his \"Thank you\" and the soft closing of the\ndoor. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.\n\n\"I told you I went there,\" said Gatsby.\n\n\"I heard you, but I'd like to know when.\"\n\n\"It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That's why I\ncan't really call myself an Oxford man.\"\n\nTom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all\nlooking at Gatsby.\n\n\"It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the\nArmistice,\" he continued. \"We could go to any of the universities in\nEngland or France.\"\n\nI wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those renewals\nof complete faith in him that I'd experienced before.\n\nDaisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.\n\n\"Open the whiskey, Tom,\" she ordered. \"And I'll make you a mint julep.\nThen you won't seem so stupid to yourself. . . . Look at the mint!\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" snapped Tom, \"I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more\nquestion.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" Gatsby said politely.\n\n\"What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?\"\n\nThey were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.\n\n\"He isn't causing a row.\" Daisy looked desperately from one to the\nother. \"You're causing a row. Please have a little self control.\"\n\n\"Self control!\" repeated Tom incredulously. \"I suppose the latest thing\nis to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife.\nWell, if that's the idea you can count me out. . . . Nowadays people begin\nby sneering at family life and family institutions and next they'll\nthrow everything overboard and have intermarriage between black\nand white.\"\n\nFlushed with his impassioned gibberish he saw himself standing alone on\nthe last barrier of civilization.\n\n\"We're all white here,\" murmured Jordan.\n\n\"I know I'm not very popular. I don't give big parties. I suppose\nyou've got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any\nfriends--in the modern world.\"\n\nAngry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened\nhis mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so complete.\n\n\"I've got something to tell YOU, old sport,----\" began Gatsby. But Daisy\nguessed at his intention.\n\n\"Please don't!\" she interrupted helplessly. \"Please let's all go home.\nWhy don't we all go home?\"\n\n\"That's a good idea.\" I got up. \"Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.\"\n\n\"I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.\"\n\n\"Your wife doesn't love you,\" said Gatsby. \"She's never loved you.\nShe loves me.\"\n\n\"You must be crazy!\" exclaimed Tom automatically.\n\nGatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.\n\n\"She never loved you, do you hear?\" he cried. \"She only married you\nbecause I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible\nmistake, but in her heart she never loved any one except me!\"\n\nAt this point Jordan and I tried to go but Tom and Gatsby insisted with\ncompetitive firmness that we remain--as though neither of them had\nanything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously\nof their emotions.\n\n\"Sit down Daisy.\" Tom's voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal\nnote. \"What's been going on? I want to hear all about it.\"\n\n\"I told you what's been going on,\" said Gatsby. \"Going on for five\nyears--and you didn't know.\"\n\nTom turned to Daisy sharply.\n\n\"You've been seeing this fellow for five years?\"\n\n\"Not seeing,\" said Gatsby. \"No, we couldn't meet. But both of us loved\neach other all that time, old sport, and you didn't know. I used to laugh\nsometimes--\"but there was no laughter in his eyes, \"to think that you\ndidn't know.\"\n\n\"Oh--that's all.\" Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman\nand leaned back in his chair.\n\n\"You're crazy!\" he exploded. \"I can't speak about what happened five years\nago, because I didn't know Daisy then--and I'll be damned if I see how you\ngot within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back\ndoor. But all the rest of that's a God Damned lie. Daisy loved me when\nshe married me and she loves me now.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Gatsby, shaking his head.\n\n\"She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas\nin her head and doesn't know what she's doing.\" He nodded sagely. \"And\nwhat's more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree\nand make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I\nlove her all the time.\"\n\n\"You're revolting,\" said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice,\ndropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: \"Do you\nknow why we left Chicago? I'm surprised that they didn't treat you to\nthe story of that little spree.\"\n\nGatsby walked over and stood beside her.\n\n\"Daisy, that's all over now,\" he said earnestly. \"It doesn't matter any\nmore. Just tell him the truth--that you never loved him--and it's all\nwiped out forever.\"\n\nShe looked at him blindly. \"Why,--how could I love him--possibly?\"\n\n\"You never loved him.\"\n\nShe hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal,\nas though she realized at last what she was doing--and as though she had\nnever, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done now.\nIt was too late.\n\n\"I never loved him,\" she said, with perceptible reluctance.\n\n\"Not at Kapiolani?\" demanded Tom suddenly.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nFrom the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up\non hot waves of air.\n\n\"Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes\ndry?\" There was a husky tenderness in his tone. \". . . Daisy?\"\n\n\"Please don't.\" Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it.\nShe looked at Gatsby. \"There, Jay,\" she said--but her hand as she tried\nto light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette and\nthe burning match on the carpet.\n\n\"Oh, you want too much!\" she cried to Gatsby. \"I love you now--isn't that\nenough? I can't help what's past.\" She began to sob helplessly.\n\"I did love him once--but I loved you too.\"\n\nGatsby's eyes opened and closed.\n\n\"You loved me TOO?\" he repeated.\n\n\"Even that's a lie,\" said Tom savagely. \"She didn't know you were alive.\nWhy,--there're things between Daisy and me that you'll never know,\nthings that neither of us can ever forget.\"\n\nThe words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.\n\n\"I want to speak to Daisy alone,\" he insisted. \"She's all excited now----\"\n\n\"Even alone I can't say I never loved Tom,\" she admitted in a pitiful\nvoice. \"It wouldn't be true.\"\n\n\"Of course it wouldn't,\" agreed Tom.\n\nShe turned to her husband.\n\n\"As if it mattered to you,\" she said.\n\n\"Of course it matters. I'm going to take better care of you from now on.\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. \"You're not\ngoing to take care of her any more.\"\n\n\"I'm not?\" Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to\ncontrol himself now. \"Why's that?\"\n\n\"Daisy's leaving you.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\n\"I am, though,\" she said with a visible effort.\n\n\"She's not leaving me!\" Tom's words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby.\n\"Certainly not for a common swindler who'd have to steal the ring he\nput on her finger.\"\n\n\"I won't stand this!\" cried Daisy. \"Oh, please let's get out.\"\n\n\"Who are you, anyhow?\" broke out Tom. \"You're one of that bunch that\nhangs around with Meyer Wolfsheim--that much I happen to know. I've made\na little investigation into your affairs--and I'll carry it further\ntomorrow.\"\n\n\"You can suit yourself about that, old sport.\" said Gatsby steadily.\n\n\"I found out what your 'drug stores' were.\" He turned to us and spoke\nrapidly. \"He and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of side-street drug stores\nhere and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. That's one of\nhis little stunts. I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw\nhim and I wasn't far wrong.\"\n\n\"What about it?\" said Gatsby politely. \"I guess your friend Walter Chase\nwasn't too proud to come in on it.\"\n\n\"And you left him in the lurch, didn't you? You let him go to jail for\na month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the subject\nof YOU.\"\n\n\"He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old\nsport.\"\n\n\"Don't you call me 'old sport'!\" cried Tom. Gatsby said nothing.\n\"Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfsheim scared\nhim into shutting his mouth.\"\n\nThat unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby's face.\n\n\"That drug store business was just small change,\" continued Tom slowly,\n\"but you've got something on now that Walter's afraid to tell me\nabout.\"\n\nI glanced at Daisy who was staring terrified between Gatsby\nand her husband and at Jordan who had begun to balance an invisible\nbut absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to\nGatsby--and was startled at his expression. He looked--and this is said\nin all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden--as if he had\n\"killed a man.\" For a moment the set of his face could be described in\njust that fantastic way.\n\nIt passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything,\ndefending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with\nevery word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave\nthat up and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped\naway, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling\nunhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.\n\nThe voice begged again to go.\n\n\"PLEASE, Tom! I can't stand this any more.\"\n\nHer frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage\nshe had had, were definitely gone.\n\n\"You two start on home, Daisy,\" said Tom. \"In Mr. Gatsby's car.\"\n\nShe looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous scorn.\n\n\"Go on. He won't annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous\nlittle flirtation is over.\"\n\nThey were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental, isolated,\nlike ghosts even from our pity.\n\nAfter a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of\nwhiskey in the towel.\n\n\"Want any of this stuff? Jordan? . . . Nick?\"\n\nI didn't answer.\n\n\"Nick?\" He asked again.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Want any?\"\n\n\"No . . . I just remembered that today's my birthday.\"\n\nI was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous menacing road of a\nnew decade.\n\nIt was seven o'clock when we got into the coup\u00e9 with him and started\nfor Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but his\nvoice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamor on the\nsidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead. Human sympathy\nhas its limits and we were content to let all their tragic arguments\nfade with the city lights behind. Thirty--the promise of a decade\nof loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning\nbrief-case of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside\nme who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten\ndreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face\nfell lazily against my coat's shoulder and the formidable stroke of\nthirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.\n\nSo we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.\n\n\nThe young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the\nashheaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had slept through\nthe heat until after five, when he strolled over to the garage and\nfound George Wilson sick in his office--really sick, pale as his own\npale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go to bed but\nWilson refused, saying that he'd miss a lot of business if he did.\nWhile his neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke\nout overhead.\n\n\"I've got my wife locked in up there,\" explained Wilson calmly.\n\"She's going to stay there till the day after tomorrow and then we're\ngoing to move away.\"\n\nMichaelis was astonished; they had been neighbors for four years and\nWilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement. Generally\nhe was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn't working he sat on a\nchair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed\nalong the road. When any one spoke to him he invariably laughed in an\nagreeable, colorless way. He was his wife's man and not his own.\n\nSo naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson\nwouldn't say a word--instead he began to throw curious, suspicious\nglances at his visitor and ask him what he'd been doing at certain\ntimes on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy some\nworkmen came past the door bound for his restaurant and Michaelis took\nthe opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he didn't.\nHe supposed he forgot to, that's all. When he came outside again\na little after seven he was reminded of the conversation because he\nheard Mrs. Wilson's voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in the garage.\n\n\"Beat me!\" he heard her cry. \"Throw me down and beat me, you dirty\nlittle coward!\"\n\nA moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and\nshouting; before he could move from his door the business was over.\n\nThe \"death car\" as the newspapers called it, didn't stop; it came out\nof the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment and then\ndisappeared around the next bend. Michaelis wasn't even sure of its\ncolor--he told the first policeman that it was light green. The other\ncar, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards\nbeyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life\nviolently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick, dark\nblood with the dust.\n\nMichaelis and this man reached her first but when they had torn open\nher shirtwaist still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left\nbreast was swinging loose like a flap and there was no need to listen\nfor the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped at the\ncorners as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous\nvitality she had stored so long.\n\n\nWe saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still\nsome distance away.\n\n\"Wreck!\" said Tom. \"That's good. Wilson'll have a little business\nat last.\"\n\nHe slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping until,\nas we came nearer, the hushed intent faces of the people at the garage\ndoor made him automatically put on the brakes.\n\n\"We'll take a look,\" he said doubtfully, \"just a look.\"\n\nI became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly\nfrom the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coup\u00e9 and walked\ntoward the door resolved itself into the words \"Oh, my God!\" uttered over\nand over in a gasping moan.\n\n\"There's some bad trouble here,\" said Tom excitedly.\n\nHe reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the\ngarage which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging wire basket\noverhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat and with a violent\nthrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through.\n\nThe circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it\nwas a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals\ndisarranged the line and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.\n\nMyrtle Wilson's body wrapped in a blanket and then in another\nblanket as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night lay on a\nwork table by the wall and Tom, with his back to us, was bending over\nit, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down\nnames with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I\ncouldn't find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed\nclamorously through the bare garage--then I saw Wilson standing on the\nraised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to\nthe doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low\nvoice and attempting from time to time to lay a hand on his shoulder,\nbut Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly from the\nswinging light to the laden table by the wall and then jerk back to\nthe light again and he gave out incessantly his high horrible call.\n\n\"O, my Ga-od! O, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!\"\n\nPresently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and after staring around the\ngarage with glazed eyes addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the\npoliceman.\n\n\"M-a-v--\" the policeman was saying, \"--o----\"\n\n\"No,--r--\" corrected the man, \"M-a-v-r-o----\"\n\n\"Listen to me!\" muttered Tom fiercely.\n\n\"r--\" said the policeman, \"o----\"\n\n\"g----\"\n\n\"g--\" He looked up as Tom's broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder.\n\"What you want, fella?\"\n\n\"What happened--that's what I want to know!\"\n\n\"Auto hit her. Ins'antly killed.\"\n\n\"Instantly killed,\" repeated Tom, staring.\n\n\"She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn't even stopus car.\"\n\n\"There was two cars,\" said Michaelis, \"one comin', one goin', see?\"\n\n\"Going where?\" asked the policeman keenly.\n\n\"One goin' each way. Well, she--\" His hand rose toward the blankets but\nstopped half way and fell to his side, \"--she ran out there an' the one\ncomin' from N'York knock right into her goin' thirty or forty miles an\nhour.\"\n\n\"What's the name of this place here?\" demanded the officer.\n\n\"Hasn't got any name.\"\n\nA pale, well-dressed Negro stepped near.\n\n\"It was a yellow car,\" he said, \"big yellow car. New.\"\n\n\"See the accident?\" asked the policeman.\n\n\"No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster'n forty. Going\nfifty, sixty.\"\n\n\"Come here and let's have your name. Look out now. I want to get his\nname.\"\n\nSome words of this conversation must have reached Wilson swaying\nin the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among\nhis gasping cries.\n\n\"You don't have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of\ncar it was!\"\n\nWatching Tom I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten\nunder his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and standing\nin front of him seized him firmly by the upper arms.\n\n\"You've got to pull yourself together,\" he said with soothing\ngruffness.\n\nWilson's eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then\nwould have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.\n\n\"Listen,\" said Tom, shaking him a little. \"I just got here a minute ago,\nfrom New York. I was bringing you that coup\u00e9 we've been talking about.\nThat yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn't mine, do you hear? I\nhaven't seen it all afternoon.\"\n\nOnly the Negro and I were near enough to hear what he said but the\npoliceman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent\neyes.\n\n\"What's all that?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I'm a friend of his.\" Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on\nWilson's body. \"He says he knows the car that did it. . . . It was a yellow\ncar.\"\n\nSome dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.\n\n\"And what color's your car?\"\n\n\"It's a blue car, a coup\u00e9.\"\n\n\"We've come straight from New York,\" I said.\n\nSome one who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this and\nthe policeman turned away.\n\n\"Now, if you'll let me have that name again correct----\"\n\nPicking up Wilson like a doll Tom carried him into the office,\nset him down in a chair and came back.\n\n\"If somebody'll come here and sit with him!\" he snapped\nauthoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced\nat each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the\ndoor on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the\ntable. As he passed close to me he whispered \"Let's get out.\"\n\nSelf consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we\npushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor,\ncase in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.\n\nTom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend--then his foot came down\nhard and the coup\u00e9 raced along through the night. In a little while I\nheard a low husky sob and saw that the tears were overflowing down his\nface.\n\n\"The God Damn coward!\" he whimpered. \"He didn't even stop his car.\"\n\n\nThe Buchanans' house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling\ntrees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor\nwhere two windows bloomed with light among the vines.\n\n\"Daisy's home,\" he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and\nfrowned slightly.\n\n\"I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There's nothing we can\ndo tonight.\"\n\nA change had come over him and he spoke gravely, and with decision.\nAs we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of\nthe situation in a few brisk phrases.\n\n\"I'll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you're waiting\nyou and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some\nsupper--if you want any.\" He opened the door. \"Come in.\"\n\n\"No thanks. But I'd be glad if you'd order me the taxi. I'll wait\noutside.\"\n\nJordan put her hand on my arm.\n\n\"Won't you come in, Nick?\"\n\n\"No thanks.\"\n\nI was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan lingered\nfor a moment more.\n\n\"It's only half past nine,\" she said.\n\nI'd be damned if I'd go in; I'd had enough of all of them for one day\nand suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of\nthis in my expression for she turned abruptly away and ran up the\nporch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head\nin my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler's\nvoice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the\nhouse intending to wait by the gate.\n\nI hadn't gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from\nbetween two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird by that\ntime because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his\npink suit under the moon.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Just standing here, old sport.\"\n\nSomehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was going\nto rob the house in a moment; I wouldn't have been surprised to see\nsinister faces, the faces of \"Wolfsheim's people,\" behind him in the\ndark shrubbery.\n\n\"Did you see any trouble on the road?\" he asked after a minute.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe hesitated.\n\n\"Was she killed?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It's better that the shock\nshould all come at once. She stood it pretty well.\"\n\nHe spoke as if Daisy's reaction was the only thing that mattered.\n\n\"I got to West Egg by a side road,\" he went on, \"and left the car in my\ngarage. I don't think anybody saw us but of course I can't be sure.\"\n\nI disliked him so much by this time that I didn't find it necessary to\ntell him he was wrong.\n\n\"Who was the woman?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it\nhappen?\"\n\n\"Well, I tried to swing the wheel----\" He broke off, and suddenly I\nguessed at the truth.\n\n\"Was Daisy driving?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said after a moment, \"but of course I'll say I was. You see,\nwhen we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would\nsteady her to drive--and this woman rushed out at us just as we were\npassing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute but it\nseemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody\nshe knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other\ncar, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second my hand\nreached the wheel I felt the shock--it must have killed her instantly.\"\n\n\"It ripped her open----\"\n\n\"Don't tell me, old sport.\" He winced. \"Anyhow--Daisy stepped on it.\nI tried to make her stop, but she couldn't so I pulled on the emergency\nbrake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.\n\n\"She'll be all right tomorrow,\" he said presently. \"I'm just going to\nwait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness\nthis afternoon. She's locked herself into her room and if he tries any\nbrutality she's going to turn the light out and on again.\"\n\n\"He won't touch her,\" I said. \"He's not thinking about her.\"\n\n\"I don't trust him, old sport.\"\n\n\"How long are you going to wait?\"\n\n\"All night if necessary. Anyhow till they all go to bed.\"\n\nA new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had\nbeen driving. He might think he saw a connection in it--he might think\nanything. I looked at the house: there were two or three bright windows\ndownstairs and the pink glow from Daisy's room on the second floor.\n\n\"You wait here,\" I said. \"I'll see if there's any sign of a commotion.\"\n\nI walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly\nand tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains were open,\nand I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where we had dined\nthat June night three months before I came to a small rectangle of light\nwhich I guessed was the pantry window. The blind was drawn but I found\na rift at the sill.\n\nDaisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table\nwith a plate of cold fried chicken between them and two bottles of\nale. He was talking intently across the table at her and in his\nearnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a\nwhile she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.\n\nThey weren't happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the\nale--and yet they weren't unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air\nof natural intimacy about the picture and anybody would have said that\nthey were conspiring together.\n\nAs I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the\ndark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in\nthe drive.\n\n\"Is it all quiet up there?\" he asked anxiously.\n\n\"Yes, it's all quiet.\" I hesitated. \"You'd better come home and get\nsome sleep.\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.\"\n\nHe put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his\nscrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of\nthe vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the\nmoonlight--watching over nothing.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\n\n\nI couldn't sleep all night; a fog-horn was groaning incessantly on the\nSound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage\nfrightening dreams. Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby's drive\nand immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress--I felt that I\nhad something to tell him, something to warn him about and morning\nwould be too late.\n\nCrossing his lawn I saw that his front door was still open and he was\nleaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.\n\n\"Nothing happened,\" he said wanly. \"I waited, and about four o'clock she\ncame to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out\nthe light.\"\n\nHis house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we\nhunted through the great rooms for cigarettes. We pushed aside curtains\nthat were like pavilions and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for\nelectric light switches--once I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the\nkeys of a ghostly piano. There was an inexplicable amount of dust\neverywhere and the rooms were musty as though they hadn't been aired for\nmany days. I found the humidor on an unfamiliar table with two stale dry\ncigarettes inside. Throwing open the French windows of the\ndrawing-room we sat smoking out into the darkness.\n\n\"You ought to go away,\" I said. \"It's pretty certain they'll trace\nyour car.\"\n\n\"Go away NOW, old sport?\"\n\n\"Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal.\"\n\nHe wouldn't consider it. He couldn't possibly leave Daisy until he knew\nwhat she was going to do. He was clutching at some last hope and I\ncouldn't bear to shake him free.\n\nIt was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with\nDan Cody--told it to me because \"Jay Gatsby\" had broken up like glass\nagainst Tom's hard malice and the long secret extravaganza was played\nout. I think that he would have acknowledged anything, now, without\nreserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.\n\nShe was the first \"nice\" girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed\ncapacities he had come in contact with such people but always\nwith indiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly\ndesirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers\nfrom Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him--he had never been\nin such a beautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless\nintensity was that Daisy lived there--it was as casual a thing to her\nas his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it,\na hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other\nbedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its\ncorridors and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in\nlavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year's shining\nmotor cars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered. It\nexcited him too that many men had already loved Daisy--it increased\nher value in his eyes. He felt their presence all about the house,\npervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.\n\nBut he knew that he was in Daisy's house by a colossal accident.\nHowever glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a\npenniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible\ncloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he made\nthe most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and\nunscrupulously--eventually he took Daisy one still October night,\ntook her because he had no real right to touch her hand.\n\nHe might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under\nfalse pretenses. I don't mean that he had traded on his phantom\nmillions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he\nlet her believe that he was a person from much the same stratum as\nherself--that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of\nfact he had no such facilities--he had no comfortable family standing\nbehind him and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government\nto be blown anywhere about the world.\n\nBut he didn't despise himself and it didn't turn out as he had\nimagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go--but\nnow he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail.\nHe knew that Daisy was extraordinary but he didn't realize just how\nextraordinary a \"nice\" girl could be. She vanished into her rich\nhouse, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby--nothing. He felt\nmarried to her, that was all.\n\nWhen they met again two days later it was Gatsby who was breathless,\nwho was somehow betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought\nluxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably\nas she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth.\nShe had caught a cold and it made her voice huskier and more charming\nthan ever and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery\nthat wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes\nand of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot\nstruggles of the poor.\n\n\n\"I can't describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her,\nold sport. I even hoped for a while that she'd throw me over, but she\ndidn't, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot\nbecause I knew different things from her. . . . Well, there I was,\nway off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and\nall of a sudden I didn't care. What was the use of doing great\nthings if I could have a better time telling her what I was going\nto do?\"\n\nOn the last afternoon before he went abroad he sat with Daisy in\nhis arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day with fire\nin the room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he\nchanged his arm a little and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The\nafternoon had made them tranquil for a while as if to give them a deep\nmemory for the long parting the next day promised. They had never been\ncloser in their month of love nor communicated more profoundly one\nwith another than when she brushed silent lips against his coat's\nshoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though\nshe were asleep.\n\n\nHe did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before he went\nto the front and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and\nthe command of the divisional machine guns. After the Armistice\nhe tried frantically to get home but some complication or\nmisunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now--there\nwas a quality of nervous despair in Daisy's letters. She didn't see why\nhe couldn't come. She was feeling the pressure of the world outside\nand she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be\nreassured that she was doing the right thing after all.\n\nFor Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids\nand pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of\nthe year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new\ntunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the\n\"Beale Street Blues\" while a hundred pairs of golden and silver\nslippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were\nalways rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low sweet fever,\nwhile fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the\nsad horns around the floor.\n\nThrough this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the\nseason; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with\nhalf a dozen men and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and\nchiffon of an evening dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor\nbeside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a\ndecision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately--and the decision\nmust be made by some force--of love, of money, of unquestionable\npracticality--that was close at hand.\n\nThat force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom\nBuchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his\nposition and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certain\nstruggle and a certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby while he was\nstill at Oxford.\n\n\nIt was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of\nthe windows downstairs, filling the house with grey turning,\ngold turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew\nand ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a\nslow pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool\nlovely day.\n\n\"I don't think she ever loved him.\" Gatsby turned around from a window\nand looked at me challengingly. \"You must remember, old sport, she was\nvery excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that\nfrightened her--that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper.\nAnd the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.\"\n\nHe sat down gloomily.\n\n\"Of course she might have loved him, just for a minute, when they were\nfirst married--and loved me more even then, do you see?\"\n\nSuddenly he came out with a curious remark:\n\n\"In any case,\" he said, \"it was just personal.\"\n\nWhat could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in\nhis conception of the affair that couldn't be measured?\n\nHe came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding\ntrip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville\non the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week, walking the\nstreets where their footsteps had clicked together through the\nNovember night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which\nthey had driven in her white car. Just as Daisy's house had always\nseemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses so his\nidea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded\nwith a melancholy beauty.\n\nHe left feeling that if he had searched harder he might have found\nher--that he was leaving her behind. The day-coach--he was penniless\nnow--was hot. He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a\nfolding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar\nbuildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow\ntrolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have\nseen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.\n\nThe track curved and now it was going away from the sun which, as it\nsank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing\ncity where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand\ndesperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of\nthe spot that she had made lovely for him. But it was all going by too\nfast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of\nit, the freshest and the best, forever.\n\n\nIt was nine o'clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the\nporch. The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there\nwas an autumn flavor in the air. The gardener, the last one of Gatsby's\nformer servants, came to the foot of the steps.\n\n\"I'm going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. Leaves'll start falling\npretty soon and then there's always trouble with the pipes.\"\n\n\"Don't do it today,\" Gatsby answered. He turned to me apologetically.\n\"You know, old sport, I've never used that pool all summer?\"\n\nI looked at my watch and stood up.\n\n\"Twelve minutes to my train.\"\n\nI didn't want to go to the city. I wasn't worth a decent stroke of work\nbut it was more than that--I didn't want to leave Gatsby. I missed that\ntrain, and then another, before I could get myself away.\n\n\"I'll call you up,\" I said finally.\n\n\"Do, old sport.\"\n\n\"I'll call you about noon.\"\n\nWe walked slowly down the steps.\n\n\"I suppose Daisy'll call too.\" He looked at me anxiously as if he\nhoped I'd corroborate this.\n\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\n\"Well--goodbye.\"\n\nWe shook hands and I started away. Just before I reached the hedge I\nremembered something and turned around.\n\n\"They're a rotten crowd,\" I shouted across the lawn. \"You're worth the\nwhole damn bunch put together.\"\n\nI've always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever gave\nhim, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end. First he nodded\npolitely, and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding\nsmile, as if we'd been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time.\nHis gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of color against the\nwhite steps and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral\nhome three months before. The lawn and drive had been crowded with the\nfaces of those who guessed at his corruption--and he had stood on those\nsteps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye.\n\nI thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thanking him for\nthat--I and the others.\n\n\"Goodbye,\" I called. \"I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.\"\n\n\nUp in the city I tried for a while to list the quotations on an\ninterminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair.\nJust before noon the phone woke me and I started up with sweat\nbreaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker; she often called\nme up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements\nbetween hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find\nin any other way. Usually her voice came over the wire as something\nfresh and cool as if a divot from a green golf links had come\nsailing in at the office window but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.\n\n\"I've left Daisy's house,\" she said. \"I'm at Hempstead and I'm going down\nto Southampton this afternoon.\"\n\nProbably it had been tactful to leave Daisy's house, but the act\nannoyed me and her next remark made me rigid.\n\n\"You weren't so nice to me last night.\"\n\n\"How could it have mattered then?\"\n\nSilence for a moment. Then--\n\n\"However--I want to see you.\"\n\n\"I want to see you too.\"\n\n\"Suppose I don't go to Southampton, and come into town this afternoon?\"\n\n\"No--I don't think this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\"It's impossible this afternoon. Various----\"\n\nWe talked like that for a while and then abruptly we weren't talking any\nlonger. I don't know which of us hung up with a sharp click but I know I\ndidn't care. I couldn't have talked to her across a tea-table that day if\nI never talked to her again in this world.\n\nI called Gatsby's house a few minutes later, but the line was busy. I\ntried four times; finally an exasperated central told me the wire was\nbeing kept open for long distance from Detroit. Taking out my\ntime-table I drew a small circle around the three-fifty train. Then I\nleaned back in my chair and tried to think. It was just noon.\n\n\nWhen I passed the ashheaps on the train that morning I had crossed\ndeliberately to the other side of the car. I suppose there'd be a\ncurious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark\nspots in the dust and some garrulous man telling over and over what\nhad happened until it became less and less real even to him and he\ncould tell it no longer and Myrtle Wilson's tragic achievement was\nforgotten. Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at the\ngarage after we left there the night before.\n\nThey had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine. She must\nhave broken her rule against drinking that night for when she\narrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the\nambulance had already gone to Flushing. When they convinced her of\nthis she immediately fainted as if that was the intolerable part of\nthe affair. Someone kind or curious took her in his car and drove\nher in the wake of her sister's body.\n\nUntil long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front\nof the garage while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the\ncouch inside. For a while the door of the office was open and\neveryone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it.\nFinally someone said it was a shame and closed the door. Michaelis and\nseveral other men were with him--first four or five men, later two or\nthree men. Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger to wait\nthere fifteen minutes longer while he went back to his own place and made\na pot of coffee. After that he stayed there alone with Wilson until dawn.\n\nAbout three o'clock the quality of Wilson's incoherent muttering\nchanged--he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car. He\nannounced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged\nto, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had\ncome from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen.\n\nBut when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry \"Oh,\nmy God!\" again in his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt\nto distract him.\n\n\"How long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sit\nstill a minute and answer my question. How long have you been married?\"\n\n\"Twelve years.\"\n\n\"Ever had any children? Come on, George, sit still--I asked you a\nquestion. Did you ever have any children?\"\n\nThe hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light and whenever\nMichaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him\nlike the car that hadn't stopped a few hours before. He didn't like to go\ninto the garage because the work bench was stained where the body had\nbeen lying so he moved uncomfortably around the office--he knew every\nobject in it before morning--and from time to time sat down beside Wilson\ntrying to keep him more quiet.\n\n\"Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if you\nhaven't been there for a long time? Maybe I could call up the church\nand get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?\"\n\n\"Don't belong to any.\"\n\n\"You ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must have\ngone to church once. Didn't you get married in a church? Listen, George,\nlisten to me. Didn't you get married in a church?\"\n\n\"That was a long time ago.\"\n\nThe effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking--for a moment he\nwas silent. Then the same half knowing, half bewildered look came back\ninto his faded eyes.\n\n\"Look in the drawer there,\" he said, pointing at the desk.\n\n\"Which drawer?\"\n\n\"That drawer--that one.\"\n\nMichaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it but\na small expensive dog leash made of leather and braided silver. It was\napparently new.\n\n\"This?\" he inquired, holding it up.\n\nWilson stared and nodded.\n\n\"I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it but I\nknew it was something funny.\"\n\n\"You mean your wife bought it?\"\n\n\"She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.\"\n\nMichaelis didn't see anything odd in that and he gave Wilson a dozen\nreasons why his wife might have bought the dog leash. But conceivably\nWilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle,\nbecause he began saying \"Oh, my God!\" again in a whisper--his comforter\nleft several explanations in the air.\n\n\"Then he killed her,\" said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly.\n\n\"Who did?\"\n\n\"I have a way of finding out.\"\n\n\"You're morbid, George,\" said his friend. \"This has been a strain to you\nand you don't know what you're saying. You'd better try and sit quiet\ntill morning.\"\n\n\"He murdered her.\"\n\n\"It was an accident, George.\"\n\nWilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly\nwith the ghost of a superior \"Hm!\"\n\n\"I know,\" he said definitely, \"I'm one of these trusting fellas and I\ndon't think any harm to NObody, but when I get to know a thing I know\nit. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he\nwouldn't stop.\"\n\nMichaelis had seen this too but it hadn't occurred to him that there was\nany special significance in it. He believed that Mrs. Wilson had been\nrunning away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any\nparticular car.\n\n\"How could she of been like that?\"\n\n\"She's a deep one,\" said Wilson, as if that answered the question.\n\"Ah-h-h----\"\n\nHe began to rock again and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in\nhis hand.\n\n\"Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?\"\n\nThis was a forlorn hope--he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend:\nthere was not enough of him for his wife. He was glad a little later when\nhe noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and\nrealized that dawn wasn't far off. About five o'clock it was blue enough\noutside to snap off the light.\n\nWilson's glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps, where small grey\nclouds took on fantastic shape and scurried here and there in the faint\ndawn wind.\n\n\"I spoke to her,\" he muttered, after a long silence. \"I told her she might\nfool me but she couldn't fool God. I took her to the window--\" With an\neffort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face\npressed against it, \"--and I said 'God knows what you've been doing,\neverything you've been doing. You may fool me but you can't fool God!' \"\n\nStanding behind him Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the\neyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg which had just emerged pale and enormous\nfrom the dissolving night.\n\n\"God sees everything,\" repeated Wilson.\n\n\"That's an advertisement,\" Michaelis assured him. Something made him turn\naway from the window and look back into the room. But Wilson stood there a\nlong time, his face close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight.\n\n\nBy six o'clock Michaelis was worn out and grateful for the sound of a\ncar stopping outside. It was one of the watchers of the night before\nwho had promised to come back so he cooked breakfast for three which\nhe and the other man ate together. Wilson was quieter now and Michaelis\nwent home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the\ngarage Wilson was gone.\n\nHis movements--he was on foot all the time--were afterward traced to Port\nRoosevelt and then to Gad's Hill where he bought a sandwich that he\ndidn't eat and a cup of coffee. He must have been tired and walking\nslowly for he didn't reach Gad's Hill until noon. Thus far there was\nno difficulty in accounting for his time--there were boys who had seen a\nman \"acting sort of crazy\" and motorists at whom he stared oddly from\nthe side of the road. Then for three hours he disappeared from view.\nThe police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he \"had\na way of finding out,\" supposed that he spent that time going from\ngarage to garage thereabouts inquiring for a yellow car. On the other\nhand no garage man who had seen him ever came forward--and perhaps he\nhad an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to know. By\nhalf past two he was in West Egg where he asked someone the way to\nGatsby's house. So by that time he knew Gatsby's name.\n\n\nAt two o'clock Gatsby put on his bathing suit and left word with the\nbutler that if any one phoned word was to be brought to him at the\npool. He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused\nhis guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him pump it up.\nThen he gave instructions that the open car wasn't to be taken out\nunder any circumstances--and this was strange because the front right\nfender needed repair.\n\nGatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once he\nstopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he\nneeded help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among\nthe yellowing trees.\n\nNo telephone message arrived but the butler went without his sleep and\nwaited for it until four o'clock--until long after there was any one to\ngive it to if it came. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn't\nbelieve it would come and perhaps he no longer cared. If that was true\nhe must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high\nprice for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up\nat an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he\nfound what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was\nupon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being\nreal, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted\nfortuitously about . . . like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward\nhim through the amorphous trees.\n\nThe chauffeur--he was one of Wolfsheim's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s--heard the\nshots--afterward he could only say that he hadn't thought anything much\nabout them. I drove from the station directly to Gatsby's house and my\nrushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed any\none. But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a word said, four\nof us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener and I, hurried down to the pool.\n\nThere was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the\nfresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other.\nWith little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden\nmattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that\nscarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental\ncourse with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves\nrevolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of compass, a thin red circle\nin the water.\n\nIt was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener\nsaw Wilson's body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was\ncomplete.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\n\n\nAfter two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the\nnext day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and\nnewspaper men in and out of Gatsby's front door. A rope stretched\nacross the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but\nlittle boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard and\nthere were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the pool.\nSomeone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the\nexpression \"mad man\" as he bent over Wilson's body that afternoon, and\nthe adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper\nreports next morning.\n\nMost of those reports were a nightmare--grotesque, circumstantial,\neager and untrue. When Michaelis's testimony at the inquest brought to\nlight Wilson's suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would\nshortly be served up in racy pasquinade--but Catherine, who might have\nsaid anything, didn't say a word. She showed a surprising amount of\ncharacter about it too--looked at the coroner with determined eyes under\nthat corrected brow of hers and swore that her sister had never seen\nGatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her\nsister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced herself of it\nand cried into her handkerchief as if the very suggestion was more\nthan she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a man \"deranged by\ngrief\" in order that the case might remain in its simplest form. And\nit rested there.\n\nBut all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself on\nGatsby's side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of\nthe catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and\nevery practical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and\nconfused; then, as he lay in his house and didn't move or breathe or\nspeak hour upon hour it grew upon me that I was responsible, because no\none else was interested--interested, I mean, with that intense personal\ninterest to which every one has some vague right at the end.\n\nI called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her\ninstinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away\nearly that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.\n\n\"Left no address?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Say when they'd be back?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Any idea where they are? How I could reach them?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Can't say.\"\n\nI wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where he\nlay and reassure him: \"I'll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don't worry.\nJust trust me and I'll get somebody for you----\"\n\nMeyer Wolfsheim's name wasn't in the phone book. The butler gave me his\noffice address on Broadway and I called Information, but by the time I\nhad the number it was long after five and no one answered the phone.\n\n\"Will you ring again?\"\n\n\"I've rung them three times.\"\n\n\"It's very important.\"\n\n\"Sorry. I'm afraid no one's there.\"\n\nI went back to the drawing room and thought for an instant that they were\nchance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it. But\nas they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with unmoved eyes,\nhis protest continued in my brain.\n\n\"Look here, old sport, you've got to get somebody for me. You've got\nto try hard. I can't go through this alone.\"\n\nSome one started to ask me questions but I broke away and going upstairs\nlooked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk--he'd never told me\ndefinitely that his parents were dead. But there was nothing--only the\npicture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence staring down from\nthe wall.\n\nNext morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfsheim\nwhich asked for information and urged him to come out on the next\ntrain. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure he'd\nstart when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there'd be a wire\nfrom Daisy before noon--but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfsheim arrived, no\none arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men.\nWhen the butler brought back Wolfsheim's answer I began to have a\nfeeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me\nagainst them all.\n\n\n_Dear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my\nlife to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a mad\nact as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down now as\nI am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in\nthis thing now. If there is anything I can do a little later let me\nknow in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when I hear about a\nthing like this and am completely knocked down and out.\n\n                                        Yours truly\n                                                      MEYER Wolfsheim_\n\nand then hasty addenda beneath:\n\n_Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all._\n\n\nWhen the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was\ncalling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came\nthrough as a man's voice, very thin and far away.\n\n\"This is Slagle speaking. . . .\"\n\n\"Yes?\" The name was unfamiliar.\n\n\"Hell of a note, isn't it? Get my wire?\"\n\n\"There haven't been any wires.\"\n\n\"Young Parke's in trouble,\" he said rapidly. \"They picked him up when he\nhanded the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New York\ngiving 'em the numbers just five minutes before. What d'you know about\nthat, hey? You never can tell in these hick towns----\"\n\n\"Hello!\" I interrupted breathlessly. \"Look here--this isn't Mr. Gatsby.\nMr. Gatsby's dead.\"\n\nThere was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an\nexclamation . . . then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.\n\n\nI think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz\narrived from a town in Minnesota. It said only that the sender was\nleaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.\n\nIt was Gatsby's father, a solemn old man very helpless and dismayed,\nbundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day. His\neyes leaked continuously with excitement and when I took the bag and\numbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse\ngrey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was on the\npoint of collapse so I took him into the music room and made him sit\ndown while I sent for something to eat. But he wouldn't eat and the\nglass of milk spilled from his trembling hand.\n\n\"I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,\" he said. \"It was all in the Chicago\nnewspaper. I started right away.\"\n\n\"I didn't know how to reach you.\"\n\nHis eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room.\n\n\"It was a mad man,\" he said. \"He must have been mad.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you like some coffee?\" I urged him.\n\n\"I don't want anything. I'm all right now, Mr.----\"\n\n\"Carraway.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?\"\n\nI took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him there.\nSome little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall;\nwhen I told them who had arrived they went reluctantly away.\n\nAfter a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth\najar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and\nunpunctual tears. He had reached an age where death no longer has the\nquality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the\nfirst time and saw the height and splendor of the hall and the great\nrooms opening out from it into other rooms his grief began to be mixed\nwith an awed pride. I helped him to a bedroom upstairs; while he took\noff his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been\ndeferred until he came.\n\n\"I didn't know what you'd want, Mr. Gatsby----\"\n\n\"Gatz is my name.\"\n\n\"--Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body west.\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position in\nthe East. Were you a friend of my boy's, Mr.--?\"\n\n\"We were close friends.\"\n\n\"He had a big future before him, you know. He was only a young man but\nhe had a lot of brain power here.\"\n\nHe touched his head impressively and I nodded.\n\n\"If he'd of lived he'd of been a great man. A man like James J. Hill.\nHe'd of helped build up the country.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" I said, uncomfortably.\n\nHe fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the bed,\nand lay down stiffly--was instantly asleep.\n\nThat night an obviously frightened person called up and demanded to know\nwho I was before he would give his name.\n\n\"This is Mr. Carraway,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh--\" He sounded relieved. \"This is Klipspringer.\"\n\nI was relieved too for that seemed to promise another friend\nat Gatsby's grave. I didn't want it to be in the papers and draw\na sightseeing crowd so I'd been calling up a few people myself.\nThey were hard to find.\n\n\"The funeral's tomorrow,\" I said. \"Three o'clock, here at the house.\nI wish you'd tell anybody who'd be interested.\"\n\n\"Oh, I will,\" he broke out hastily. \"Of course I'm not likely to see\nanybody, but if I do.\"\n\nHis tone made me suspicious.\n\n\"Of course you'll be there yourself.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll certainly try. What I called up about is----\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" I interrupted. \"How about saying you'll come?\"\n\n\"Well, the fact is--the truth of the matter is that I'm staying with\nsome people up here in Greenwich and they rather expect me to be with\nthem tomorrow. In fact there's a sort of picnic or something.\nOf course I'll do my very best to get away.\"\n\nI ejaculated an unrestrained \"Huh!\" and he must have heard me for he went\non nervously:\n\n\"What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. I wonder if\nit'd be too much trouble to have the butler send them on. You\nsee they're tennis shoes and I'm sort of helpless without them. My\naddress is care of B. F.----\"\n\nI didn't hear the rest of the name because I hung up the receiver.\n\nAfter that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby--one gentleman to whom I\ntelephoned implied that he had got what he deserved. However, that was\nmy fault, for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at\nGatsby on the courage of Gatsby's liquor and I should have known\nbetter than to call him.\n\nThe morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer\nWolfsheim; I couldn't seem to reach him any other way. The door that I\npushed open on the advice of an elevator boy was marked \"The Swastika\nHolding Company\" and at first there didn't seem to be any one inside.\nBut when I'd shouted \"Hello\" several times in vain an argument broke\nout behind a partition and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an\ninterior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes.\n\n\"Nobody's in,\" she said. \"Mr. Wolfsheim's gone to Chicago.\"\n\nThe first part of this was obviously untrue for someone had begun to\nwhistle \"The Rosary,\" tunelessly, inside.\n\n\"Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.\"\n\n\"I can't get him back from Chicago, can I?\"\n\nAt this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfsheim's called \"Stella!\"\nfrom the other side of the door.\n\n\"Leave your name on the desk,\" she said quickly. \"I'll give it to him\nwhen he gets back.\"\n\n\"But I know he's there.\"\n\nShe took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up\nand down her hips.\n\n\"You young men think you can force your way in here any time,\" she\nscolded. \"We're getting sickantired of it. When I say he's in Chicago,\nhe's in ChiCAgo.\"\n\nI mentioned Gatsby.\n\n\"Oh--h!\" She looked at me over again. \"Will you just--what was your name?\"\n\nShe vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfsheim stood solemnly in the doorway,\nholding out both hands. He drew me into his office, remarking in a\nreverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered me\na cigar.\n\n\"My memory goes back to when I first met him,\" he said. \"A young\nmajor just out of the army and covered over with medals he got\nin the war. He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform\nbecause he couldn't buy some regular clothes. First time I saw him was\nwhen he come into Winebrenner's poolroom at Forty-third Street and\nasked for a job. He hadn't eat anything for a couple of days. 'Come on\nhave some lunch with me,' I sid. He ate more than four dollars' worth of\nfood in half an hour.\"\n\n\"Did you start him in business?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Start him! I made him.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right\naway he was a fine appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told\nme he was an Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join up\nin the American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he\ndid some work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like\nthat in everything--\" He held up two bulbous fingers \"--always\ntogether.\"\n\nI wondered if this partnership had included the World's Series transaction\nin 1919.\n\n\"Now he's dead,\" I said after a moment. \"You were his closest friend,\nso I know you'll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.\"\n\n\"I'd like to come.\"\n\n\"Well, come then.\"\n\nThe hair in his nostrils quivered slightly and as he shook his head his\neyes filled with tears.\n\n\"I can't do it--I can't get mixed up in it,\" he said.\n\n\"There's nothing to get mixed up in. It's all over now.\"\n\n\"When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way.\nI keep out. When I was a young man it was different--if a friend of mine\ndied, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You may think that's\nsentimental but I mean it--to the bitter end.\"\n\nI saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come,\nso I stood up.\n\n\"Are you a college man?\" he inquired suddenly.\n\nFor a moment I thought he was going to suggest a \"gonnegtion\" but he\nonly nodded and shook my hand.\n\n\"Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not\nafter he is dead,\" he suggested. \"After that my own rule is to let\neverything alone.\"\n\nWhen I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West Egg\nin a drizzle. After changing my clothes I went next door and found\nMr. Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall. His pride in his\nson and in his son's possessions was continually increasing and now he\nhad something to show me.\n\n\"Jimmy sent me this picture.\" He took out his wallet with trembling\nfingers. \"Look there.\"\n\nIt was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirty with\nmany hands. He pointed out every detail to me eagerly. \"Look there!\" and\nthen sought admiration from my eyes. He had shown it so often that I think\nit was more real to him now than the house itself.\n\n\"Jimmy sent it to me. I think it's a very pretty picture. It shows up\nwell.\"\n\n\"Very well. Had you seen him lately?\"\n\n\"He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in\nnow. Of course we was broke up when he run off from home but I see now\nthere was a reason for it. He knew he had a big future in front of him.\nAnd ever since he made a success he was very generous with me.\"\n\nHe seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another minute,\nlingeringly, before my eyes. Then he returned the wallet and pulled from\nhis pocket a ragged old copy of a book called \"Hopalong Cassidy.\"\n\n\"Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows\nyou.\"\n\nHe opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see.\nOn the last fly-leaf was printed the word SCHEDULE, and the date\nSeptember 12th, 1906. And underneath:\n\n\nRise from bed . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  6.00       A.M.\nDumbbell exercise and wall-scaling . . . . . . 6.15-6.30   \"\nStudy electricity, etc . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.15-8.15   \"\nWork . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8.30-4.30  P.M.\nBaseball and sports . . . . . . . . . . . . .  4.30-5.00   \"\nPractice elocution, poise and how to attain it 5.00-6.00   \"\nStudy needed inventions . . . . . . . . . . .  7.00-9.00   \"\n\n                GENERAL RESOLVES\n\nNo wasting time at Shafters or [a name, indecipherable]\nNo more smokeing or chewing\nBath every other day\nRead one improving book or magazine per week\nSave $5.00 [crossed out] $3.00 per week\nBe better to parents\n\n\n\"I come across this book by accident,\" said the old man. \"It just shows\nyou, don't it?\"\n\n\"It just shows you.\"\n\n\"Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this or\nsomething. Do you notice what he's got about improving his mind? He was\nalways great for that. He told me I et like a hog once and I beat him\nfor it.\"\n\nHe was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then\nlooking eagerly at me. I think he rather expected me to copy down the\nlist for my own use.\n\nA little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing and\nI began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars. So did\nGatsby's father. And as the time passed and the servants came in and\nstood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously and he\nspoke of the rain in a worried uncertain way. The minister glanced\nseveral times at his watch so I took him aside and asked him to wait\nfor half an hour. But it wasn't any use. Nobody came.\n\n\nAbout five o'clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery\nand stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate--first a motor hearse,\nhorribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and I in the\nlimousine, and, a little later, four or five servants and the postman\nfrom West Egg in Gatsby's station wagon, all wet to the skin. As we\nstarted through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then\nthe sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. I looked\naround. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found\nmarvelling over Gatsby's books in the library one night three months\nbefore.\n\nI'd never seen him since then. I don't know how he knew about the\nfuneral or even his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses and\nhe took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled\nfrom Gatsby's grave.\n\nI tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment but he was already too\nfar away and I could only remember, without resentment, that Daisy\nhadn't sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur\n\"Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,\" and then the owl-eyed\nman said \"Amen to that,\" in a brave voice.\n\nWe straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-Eyes spoke\nto me by the gate.\n\n\"I couldn't get to the house,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Neither could anybody else.\"\n\n\"Go on!\" He started. \"Why, my God! they used to go there by the\nhundreds.\"\n\nHe took off his glasses and wiped them again outside and in.\n\n\"The poor son-of-a-bitch,\" he said.\n\n\nOne of my most vivid memories is of coming back west from prep school\nand later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than\nChicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o'clock of a\nDecember evening with a few Chicago friends already caught up into\ntheir own holiday gayeties to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember\nthe fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This or That's and\nthe chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as\nwe caught sight of old acquaintances and the matchings of invitations:\n\"Are you going to the Ordways'? the Herseys'? the Schultzes'?\"\nand the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands.\nAnd last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul\nRailroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside\nthe gate.\n\nWhen we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow,\nbegan to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the\ndim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace\ncame suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked\nback from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our\nidentity with this country for one strange hour before we melted\nindistinguishably into it again.\n\nThat's my middle west--not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede\ntowns but the thrilling, returning trains of my youth and the street\nlamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly\nwreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a\nlittle solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent\nfrom growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are\nstill called through decades by a family's name. I see now that this\nhas been a story of the West, after all--Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and\nJordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some\ndeficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.\n\nEven when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware\nof its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the\nOhio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the\nchildren and the very old--even then it had always for me a quality of\ndistortion. West Egg especially still figures in my more fantastic\ndreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at\nonce conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging\nsky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress\nsuits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a\ndrunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over\nthe side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a\nhouse--the wrong house. But no one knows the woman's name, and no one\ncares.\n\nAfter Gatsby's death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted\nbeyond my eyes' power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle\nleaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the\nline I decided to come back home.\n\nThere was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant\nthing that perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted to\nleave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent\nsea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and\naround what had happened to us together and what had happened\nafterward to me, and she lay perfectly still listening in a big\nchair.\n\nShe was dressed to play golf and I remember thinking she looked like a\ngood illustration, her chin raised a little, jauntily, her hair the\ncolor of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless\nglove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without comment that\nshe was engaged to another man. I doubted that though there were\nseveral she could have married at a nod of her head but I pretended to\nbe surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn't making a\nmistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say\ngoodbye.\n\n\"Nevertheless you did throw me over,\" said Jordan suddenly. \"You threw me\nover on the telephone. I don't give a damn about you now but it was a\nnew experience for me and I felt a little dizzy for a while.\"\n\nWe shook hands.\n\n\"Oh, and do you remember--\" she added, \"----a conversation we had once\nabout driving a car?\"\n\n\"Why--not exactly.\"\n\n\"You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver?\nWell, I met another bad driver, didn't I? I mean it was careless of me\nto make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest,\nstraightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.\"\n\n\"I'm thirty,\" I said. \"I'm five years too old to lie to myself and call\nit honor.\"\n\nShe didn't answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously\nsorry, I turned away.\n\n\nOne afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead\nof me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a\nlittle from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving\nsharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as I\nslowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into\nthe windows of a jewelry store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back\nholding out his hand.\n\n\"What's the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?\"\n\n\"Yes. You know what I think of you.\"\n\n\"You're crazy, Nick,\" he said quickly. \"Crazy as hell. I don't know\nwhat's the matter with you.\"\n\n\"Tom,\" I inquired, \"what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?\"\n\nHe stared at me without a word and I knew I had guessed right about\nthose missing hours. I started to turn away but he took a step after me\nand grabbed my arm.\n\n\"I told him the truth,\" he said. \"He came to the door while we were\ngetting ready to leave and when I sent down word that we weren't in he\ntried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if I\nhadn't told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his\npocket every minute he was in the house----\" He broke off defiantly.\n\"What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw\ndust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy's but he was a tough\none. He ran over Myrtle like you'd run over a dog and never even stopped\nhis car.\"\n\nThere was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact\nthat it wasn't true.\n\n\"And if you think I didn't have my share of suffering--look here, when I\nwent to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting\nthere on the sideboard I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it\nwas awful----\"\n\nI couldn't forgive him or like him but I saw that what he had done was,\nto him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused.\nThey were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and\ncreatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast\ncarelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other\npeople clean up the mess they had made. . . .\n\nI shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as\nthough I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewelry store to\nbuy a pearl necklace--or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons--rid of my\nprovincial squeamishness forever.\n\n\nGatsby's house was still empty when I left--the grass on his lawn had\ngrown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village never\ntook a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and\npointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to\nEast Egg the night of the accident and perhaps he had made a story\nabout it all his own. I didn't want to hear it and I avoided him when I\ngot off the train.\n\nI spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling\nparties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the\nmusic and the laughter faint and incessant from his garden and the\ncars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a material car\nthere and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I didn't\ninvestigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the\nends of the earth and didn't know that the party was over.\n\nOn the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer,\nI went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once\nmore. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a\npiece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight and I erased it,\ndrawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the\nbeach and sprawled out on the sand.\n\nMost of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any\nlights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound.\nAnd as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away\nuntil gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered\nonce for Dutch sailors' eyes--a fresh, green breast of the new world.\nIts vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby's house, had\nonce pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams;\nfor a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the\npresence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation\nhe neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in\nhistory with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.\n\nAnd as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of\nGatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of\nDaisy's dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must\nhave seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not\nknow that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity\nbeyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under\nthe night.\n\nGatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by\nyear recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow\nwe will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine\nmorning----\n\nSo we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into\nthe past.\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nProject Gutenberg Australia",
        "summary": "**Summary of \"The Great Gatsby\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald**\n\n\"The Great Gatsby\" revolves around the mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his obsession with the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. The story is narrated by Nick Carraway, who moves to West Egg, Long Island, where he becomes Gatsby's neighbor.\n\nGatsby throws extravagant parties in hopes of attracting Daisy, his former lover. As their relationship rekindles, tensions arise due to Tom Buchanan, Daisy's wealthy husband, and his suspicions of Gatsby\u2019s past and wealth. Tom represents old money, while Gatsby symbolizes new money and the American Dream gone awry.\n\nAmidst the novel, themes of love, wealth, class, and the pursuit of the American Dream are explored. Gatsby's lavish lifestyle is contrasted with the grim realities in the valley of ashes, portrayed by the character George Wilson, who suffers from the consequences of aspirations that lead to tragedy.\n\nThe story culminates in a series of tragic events following a hit-and-run accident involving Gatsby's car, which leads to the death of Myrtle Wilson, George Wilson's wife. Tom manipulates George into believing Gatsby was responsible, leading to Gatsby\u2019s demise as George seeks revenge.\n\nIn the end, Gatsby's dream collapses as he is left alone, abandoned by Daisy and ultimately killed by George. The novel concludes with Nick reflecting on Gatsby\u2019s idealism and the elusive nature of the American Dream, indicating that no matter how hard one strives, the past is inescapable and can never be reclaimed.\n\nThe themes of aspiration, love, and the moral decay of society resonate throughout the story, showcasing Fitzgerald's critique of the American Dream and its unattainable nature.",
