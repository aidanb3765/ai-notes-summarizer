Scott Fitzgerald\n\n\n\nThen wear the gold hat, if that will move her;\n  If you can bounce high, bounce for her too,\nTill she cry \"Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover,\n  I must have you!\"\n\n                    --THOMAS PARKE D'INVILLIERS\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\n\n\nIn my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice\nthat I've been turning over in my mind ever since.\n\n\"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,\" he told me, \"just\nremember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages\nthat you've had.\"\n\nHe didn't say any more but we've always been unusually communicative\nin a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more\nthan that. In consequence I'm inclined to reserve all judgments,\na habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also\nmade me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind\nis quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it\nappears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I\nwas unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the\nsecret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were\nunsought--frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile\nlevity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate\nrevelation was quivering on the horizon--for the intimate revelations\nof young men or at least the terms in which they express them are\nusually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving\njudgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of\nmissing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested,\nand I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is\nparcelled out unequally at birth.\n\nAnd, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission\nthat it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet\nmarshes but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on.\nWhen I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the\nworld to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I\nwanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the\nhuman heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was\nexempt from my reaction--Gatsby who represented everything for which I\nhave an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of\nsuccessful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some\nheightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related\nto one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten\nthousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that\nflabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the\n\"creative temperament\"--it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic\nreadiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it\nis not likely I shall ever find again. No--Gatsby turned out all right\nat the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the\nwake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the\nabortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.\n\n\nMy family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle-western\ncity for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan and we\nhave a tradition that we're descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the\nactual founder of my line was my grandfather's brother who came here in\nfifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War and started the wholesale\nhardware business that my father carries on today.\n\nI never saw this great-uncle but I'm supposed to look like him--with\nspecial reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in\nFather's office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a\ncentury after my father, and a little later I participated in that\ndelayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the\ncounter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being\nthe warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like the\nragged edge of the universe--so I decided to go east and learn the bond\nbusiness. Everybody I knew was in the bond business so I supposed it\ncould support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it\nover as if they were choosing a prep-school for me and finally said,\n\"Why--ye-es\" with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance\nme for a year and after various delays I came east, permanently, I\nthought, in the spring of twenty-two.\n\nThe practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was a warm\nseason and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees,\nso when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house\ntogether in a commuting town it sounded like a great idea. He found\nthe house, a weather beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but\nat the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went out\nto the country alone. I had a dog, at least I had him for a few days\nuntil he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman who made my bed\nand cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the\nelectric stove.\n\nIt was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently\narrived than I, stopped me on the road.\n\n\"How do you get to West Egg village?\" he asked helplessly.\n\nI told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a\npathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the\nfreedom of the neighborhood.\n\nAnd so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the\ntrees--just as things grow in fast movies--I had that familiar\nconviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.\n\nThere was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health to be\npulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen\nvolumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood\non my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to\nunfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas\nknew. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides.\nI was rather literary in college--one year I wrote a series of very\nsolemn and obvious editorials for the \"Yale News\"--and now I was going\nto bring back all such things into my life and become again that most\nlimited of all specialists, the \"well-rounded man.\" This isn't just an\nepigram--life is much more successfully looked at from a single window,\nafter all.\n\nIt was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of\nthe strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender\nriotous island which extends itself due east of New York and where\nthere are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of\nland. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in\ncontour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most\ndomesticated body of salt water in the Western Hemisphere, the great\nwet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals--like the\negg in the Columbus story they are both crushed flat at the contact\nend--but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual\nconfusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more\narresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except\nshape and size.\n\nI lived at West Egg, the--well, the less fashionable of the two, though\nthis is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little\nsinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the\negg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge\nplaces that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on\nmy right was a colossal affair by any standard--it was a factual\nimitation of some H\u00f4tel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side,\nspanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool\nand more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby's mansion.\nOr rather, as I didn't know Mr. Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by\na gentleman of that name. My own house was an eye-sore, but it was a\nsmall eye-sore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the\nwater, a partial view of my neighbor's lawn, and the consoling\nproximity of millionaires--all for eighty dollars a month.\n\nAcross the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg\nglittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins\non the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom\nBuchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed and I'd known Tom\nin college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in\nChicago.\n\nHer husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of\nthe most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven--a\nnational figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute\nlimited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of\nanti-climax. His family were enormously wealthy--even in college his\nfreedom with money was a matter for reproach--but now he'd left Chicago\nand come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for\ninstance he'd brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest.\nIt was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy\nenough to do that.\n\nWhy they came east I don't know. They had spent a year in France, for no\nparticular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever\npeople played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move,\nsaid Daisy over the telephone, but I didn't believe it--I had no sight\ninto Daisy's heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking\na little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable\nfootball game.\n\nAnd so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East\nEgg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was\neven more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red and white Georgian\nColonial mansion overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach\nand ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over\nsun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens--finally when it reached\nthe house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the\nmomentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows,\nglowing now with reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy\nafternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his\nlegs apart on the front porch.\n\nHe had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy, straw haired\nman of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner.\nTwo shining, arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and\ngave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not\neven the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous\npower of that body--he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he\nstrained the top lacing and you could see a great pack of muscle\nshifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body\ncapable of enormous leverage--a cruel body.\n\nHis speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of\nfractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in\nit, even toward people he liked--and there were men at New Haven who had\nhated his guts.\n\n\"Now, don't think my opinion on these matters is final,\" he seemed to\nsay, \"just because I'm stronger and more of a man than you are.\" We\nwere in the same Senior Society, and while we were never intimate I\nalways had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like\nhim with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.\n\nWe talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.\n\n\"I've got a nice place here,\" he said, his eyes flashing about\nrestlessly.\n\nTurning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat hand along the\nfront vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half\nacre of deep pungent roses and a snub-nosed motor boat that bumped\nthe tide off shore.\n\n\"It belonged to Demaine the oil man.\" He turned me around again,\npolitely and abruptly. \"We'll go inside.\"\n\nWe walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space,\nfragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end.\nThe windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass\noutside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze\nblew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other\nlike pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of\nthe ceiling--and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a\nshadow on it as wind does on the sea.\n\nThe only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch\non which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored\nballoon. They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and\nfluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight\naround the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the\nwhip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall.\nThen there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught\nwind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two\nyoung women ballooned slowly to the floor.\n\nThe younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length\nat her end of the divan, completely motionless and with her chin raised\na little as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely\nto fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of\nit--indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having\ndisturbed her by coming in.\n\nThe other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise--she leaned slightly\nforward with a conscientious expression--then she laughed, an absurd,\ncharming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the\nroom.\n\n\"I'm p-paralyzed with happiness.\"\n\nShe laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand\nfor a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one\nin the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had.\nShe hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker.\n(I've heard it said that Daisy's murmur was only to make people\nlean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)\n\nAt any rate Miss Baker's lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost\nimperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back again--the object\nshe was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something\nof a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any\nexhibition of complete self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.\n\nI looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low,\nthrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and\ndown as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be\nplayed again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,\nbright eyes and a bright passionate mouth--but there was an excitement\nin her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget:\na singing compulsion, a whispered \"Listen,\" a promise that she had done\ngay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,\nexciting things hovering in the next hour.\n\nI told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way east\nand how a dozen people had sent their love through me.\n\n\"Do they miss me?\" she cried ecstatically.\n\n\"The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel\npainted black as a mourning wreath and there's a persistent wail all\nnight along the North Shore.\"\n\n\"How gorgeous! Let's go back, Tom. Tomorrow!\" Then she added\nirrelevantly, \"You ought to see the baby.\"\n\n\"I'd like to.\"\n\n\"She's asleep. She's two years old. Haven't you ever seen her?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Well, you ought to see her. She's----\"\n\nTom Buchanan who had been hovering restlessly about the room stopped\nand rested his hand on my shoulder.\n\n\"What you doing, Nick?\"\n\n\"I'm a bond man.\"\n\n\"Who with?\"\n\nI told him.\n\n\"Never heard of them,\" he remarked decisively.\n\nThis annoyed me.\n\n\"You will,\" I answered shortly. \"You will if you stay in the East.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll stay in the East, don't you worry,\" he said, glancing at\nDaisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more.\n\"I'd be a God Damned fool to live anywhere else.\"\n\nAt this point Miss Baker said \"Absolutely!\" with such suddenness that I\nstarted--it was the first word she uttered since I came into the room.\nEvidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and\nwith a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.\n\n\"I'm stiff,\" she complained, \"I've been lying on that sofa for as long\nas I can remember.\"\n\n\"Don't look at me,\" Daisy retorted. \"I've been trying to get you to New\nYork all afternoon.\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the\npantry, \"I'm absolutely in training.\"\n\nHer host looked at her incredulously.\n\n\"You are!\" He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of\na glass. \"How you ever get anything done is beyond me.\"\n\nI looked at Miss Baker wondering what it was she \"got done.\" I enjoyed\nlooking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect\ncarriage which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the\nshoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at\nme with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming discontented\nface. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her,\nsomewhere before.\n\n\"You live in West Egg,\" she remarked contemptuously. \"I know somebody\nthere.\"\n\n\"I don't know a single----\"\n\n\"You must know Gatsby.\"\n\n\"Gatsby?\" demanded Daisy. \"What Gatsby?\"\n\nBefore I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced;\nwedging his tense arm imperatively under mine Tom Buchanan compelled\nme from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.\n\nSlenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips the two\nyoung women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch open toward the\nsunset where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished\nwind.\n\n\"Why CANDLES?\" objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her\nfingers. \"In two weeks it'll be the longest day in the year.\"\nShe looked at us all radiantly. \"Do you always watch for the longest day\nof the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the\nyear and then miss it.\"\n\n\"We ought to plan something,\" yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the\ntable as if she were getting into bed.\n\n\"All right,\" said Daisy. \"What'll we plan?\" She turned to me helplessly.\n\"What do people plan?\"\n\nBefore I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her\nlittle finger.\n\n\"Look!\" she complained. \"I hurt it.\"\n\nWe all looked--the knuckle was black and blue.\n\n\"You did it, Tom,\" she said accusingly. \"I know you didn't mean to\nbut you DID do it. That's what I get for marrying a brute of a man,\na great big hulking physical specimen of a----\"\n\n\"I hate that word hulking,\" objected Tom crossly, \"even in kidding.\"\n\n\"Hulking,\" insisted Daisy.\n\nSometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a\nbantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool\nas their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all\ndesire. They were here--and they accepted Tom and me, making only a\npolite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew\nthat presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too\nwould be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the\nWest where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its\nclose in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer\nnervous dread of the moment itself.\n\n\"You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,\" I confessed on my second glass\nof corky but rather impressive claret. \"Can't you talk about crops or\nsomething?\"\n\nI meant nothing in particular by this remark but it was taken up in an\nunexpected way.\n\n\"Civilization's going to pieces,\" broke out Tom violently.\n\"I've gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read\n'The Rise of the Coloured Empires' by this man Goddard?\"\n\n\"Why, no,\" I answered, rather surprised by his tone.\n\n\"Well, it's a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if\nwe don't look out the white race will be--will be utterly submerged.\nIt's all scientific stuff; it's been proved.\"\n\n\"Tom's getting very profound,\" said Daisy with an expression of\nunthoughtful sadness. \"He reads deep books with long words in them.\nWhat was that word we----\"\n\n\"Well, these books are all scientific,\" insisted Tom, glancing at her\nimpatiently. \"This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up to us\nwho are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have\ncontrol of things.\"\n\n\"We've got to beat them down,\" whispered Daisy, winking ferociously\ntoward the fervent sun.\n\n\"You ought to live in California--\" began Miss Baker but Tom\ninterrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.\n\n\"This idea is that we're Nordics. I am, and you are and you are\nand----\" After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a\nslight nod and she winked at me again. \"--and we've produced all the\nthings that go to make civilization--oh, science and art and all that.\nDo you see?\"\n\nThere was something pathetic in his concentration as if his complacency,\nmore acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. When, almost\nimmediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy\nseized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.\n\n\"I'll tell you a family secret,\" she whispered enthusiastically. \"It's\nabout the butler's nose. Do you want to hear about the butler's nose?\"\n\n\"That's why I came over tonight.\"\n\n\"Well, he wasn't always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for\nsome people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people.\nHe had to polish it from morning till night until finally it began to\naffect his nose----\"\n\n\"Things went from bad to worse,\" suggested Miss Baker.\n\n\"Yes. Things went from bad to worse until finally he had to give up\nhis position.\"\n\nFor a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon\nher glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as\nI listened--then the glow faded, each light deserting her with\nlingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.\n\nThe butler came back and murmured something close to Tom's ear\nwhereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair and without a word went\ninside. As if his absence quickened something within her Daisy leaned\nforward again, her voice glowing and singing.\n\n\"I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a--of a rose, an\nabsolute rose. Doesn't he?\" She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation.\n\"An absolute rose?\"\n\nThis was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only\nextemporizing but a stirring warmth flowed from her as if her\nheart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those\nbreathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the\ntable and excused herself and went into the house.\n\nMiss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of\nmeaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said \"Sh!\" in\na warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room\nbeyond and Miss Baker leaned forward, unashamed, trying to hear. The\nmurmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted\nexcitedly, and then ceased altogether.\n\n\"This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor----\" I said.\n\n\"Don't talk. I want to hear what happens.\"\n\n\"Is something happening?\" I inquired innocently.\n\n\"You mean to say you don't know?\" said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.\n\"I thought everybody knew.\"\n\n\"I don't.\"\n\n\"Why----\" she said hesitantly, \"Tom's got some woman in New York.\"\n\n\"Got some woman?\" I repeated blankly.\n\nMiss Baker nodded.\n\n\"She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner-time. Don't\nyou think?\"\n\nAlmost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of\na dress and the crunch of leather boots and Tom and Daisy were back\nat the table.\n\n\"It couldn't be helped!\" cried Daisy with tense gayety.\n\nShe sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me and\ncontinued: \"I looked outdoors for a minute and it's very romantic\noutdoors. There's a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale\ncome over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He's singing away----\" her\nvoice sang \"----It's romantic, isn't it, Tom?\"\n\n\"Very romantic,\" he said, and then miserably to me: \"If it's light enough\nafter dinner I want to take you down to the stables.\"\n\nThe telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her\nhead decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all\nsubjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the\nlast five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again,\npointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every\none and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn't guess what Daisy and Tom\nwere thinking but I doubt if even Miss Baker who seemed to have\nmastered a certain hardy skepticism was able utterly to put this fifth\nguest's shrill metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament\nthe situation might have seemed intriguing--my own instinct was to\ntelephone immediately for the police.\n\nThe horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss\nBaker, with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into\nthe library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while\ntrying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf I followed\nDaisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In\nits deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.\n\nDaisy took her face in her hands, as if feeling its lovely shape, and\nher eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent\nemotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some\nsedative questions about her little girl.\n\n\"We don't know each other very well, Nick,\" she said suddenly.\n\"Even if we are cousins. You didn't come to my wedding.\"\n\n\"I wasn't back from the war.\"\n\n\"That's true.\" She hesitated. \"Well, I've had a very bad time, Nick,\nand I'm pretty cynical about everything.\"\n\nEvidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn't say any more,\nand after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her\ndaughter.\n\n\"I suppose she talks, and--eats, and everything.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\" She looked at me absently. \"Listen, Nick; let me tell you what\nI said when she was born. Would you like to hear?\"\n\n\"Very much.\"\n\n\"It'll show you how I've gotten to feel about--things. Well, she was less\nthan an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether\nwith an utterly abandoned feeling and asked the nurse right away if it\nwas a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head\naway and wept. 'All right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope\nshe'll be a fool--that's the best thing a girl can be in this world,\na beautiful little fool.\"\n\n\"You see I think everything's terrible anyhow,\" she went on in a\nconvinced way. \"Everybody thinks so--the most advanced people. And I KNOW.\nI've been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.\"\nHer eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom's, and she\nlaughed with thrilling scorn. \"Sophisticated--God, I'm sophisticated!\"\n\nThe instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention,\nmy belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said.\nIt made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick\nof some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited,\nand sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk\non her lovely face as if she had asserted her membership in a rather\ndistinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.\n\n\nInside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker\nsat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from\nthe \"Saturday Evening Post\"--the words, murmurous and\nuninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamp-light,\nbright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair,\nglinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender\nmuscles in her arms.\n\nWhen we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.\n\n\"To be continued,\" she said, tossing the magazine on the table, \"in our\nvery next issue.\"\n\nHer body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she\nstood up.\n\n\"Ten o'clock,\" she remarked, apparently finding the time on the\nceiling. \"Time for this good girl to go to bed.\"\n\n\"Jordan's going to play in the tournament tomorrow,\" explained Daisy,\n\"over at Westchester.\"\n\n\"Oh,--you're JORdan Baker.\"\n\nI knew now why her face was familiar--its pleasing contemptuous\nexpression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of\nthe sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I\nhad heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story,\nbut what it was I had forgotten long ago.\n\n\"Good night,\" she said softly. \"Wake me at eight, won't you.\"\n\n\"If you'll get up.\"\n\n\"I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.\"\n\n\"Of course you will,\" confirmed Daisy. \"In fact I think I'll arrange\na marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I'll sort of--oh--fling you\ntogether. You know--lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push\nyou out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing----\"\n\n\"Good night,\" called Miss Baker from the stairs. \"I haven't heard a word.\"\n\n\"She's a nice girl,\" said Tom after a moment. \"They oughtn't to let her\nrun around the country this way.\"\n\n\"Who oughtn't to?\" inquired Daisy coldly.\n\n\"Her family.\"\n\n\"Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick's\ngoing to look after her, aren't you, Nick? She's going to spend lots of\nweek-ends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very\ngood for her.\"\n\nDaisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.\n\n\"Is she from New York?\" I asked quickly.\n\n\"From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our\nbeautiful white----\"\n\n\"Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?\"\ndemanded Tom suddenly.\n\n\"Did I?\" She looked at me. \"I can't seem to remember, but I think\nwe talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I'm sure we did. It sort of\ncrept up on us and first thing you know----\"\n\n\"Don't believe everything you hear, Nick,\" he advised me.\n\nI said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later\nI got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood side by\nside in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor Daisy\nperemptorily called \"Wait!\n\n\"I forgot to ask you something, and it's important. We heard you were\nengaged to a girl out West.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" corroborated Tom kindly. \"We heard that you were\nengaged.\"\n\n\"It's libel. I'm too poor.\"\n\n\"But we heard it,\" insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in\na flower-like way. \"We heard it from three people so it must be true.\"\n\nOf course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn't even vaguely\nengaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the\nreasons I had come east. You can't stop going with an old friend on\naccount of rumors and on the other hand I had no intention of being\nrumored into marriage.\n\nTheir interest rather touched me and made them less remotely\nrich--nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove\naway. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of\nthe house, child in arms--but apparently there were no such intentions\nin her head. As for Tom, the fact that he \"had some woman in New York\"\nwas really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book.\nSomething was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his\nsturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.\n\nAlready it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside\ngarages, where new red gas-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I\nreached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for\na while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown\noff, leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees and\na persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the\nfrogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the\nmoonlight and turning my head to watch it I saw that I was not\nalone--fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my\nneighbor's mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets\nregarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely\nmovements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested\nthat it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was\nhis of our local heavens.\n\nI decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and\nthat would do for an introduction. But I didn't call to him for he gave\na sudden intimation that he was content to be alone--he stretched out his\narms toward the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him\nI could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward--and\ndistinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away,\nthat might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby\nhe had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n\n\nAbout half way between West Egg and New York the motor-road hastily\njoins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to\nshrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of\nashes--a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and\nhills and grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and\nchimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcendent effort, of\nmen who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.\nOccasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives\nout a ghastly creak and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey\nmen swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud\nwhich screens their obscure operations from your sight.\n\nBut above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift\nendlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T.\nJ. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and\ngigantic--their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face but,\ninstead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a\nnonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to\nfatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself\ninto eternal blindness or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes,\ndimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain, brood on over\nthe solemn dumping ground.\n\nThe valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and\nwhen the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on\nwaiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an\nhour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute and it was\nbecause of this that I first met Tom Buchanan's mistress.\n\nThe fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. His\nacquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular\nrestaurants with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about,\nchatting with whomsoever he knew. Though I was curious to see her I\nhad no desire to meet her--but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on\nthe train one afternoon and when we stopped by the ashheaps he jumped\nto his feet and taking hold of my elbow literally forced me from the\ncar.\n\n\"We're getting off!\" he insisted. \"I want you to meet my girl.\"\n\nI think he'd tanked up a good deal at luncheon and his determination to\nhave my company bordered on violence. The supercilious assumption was that\non Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.\n\nI followed him over a low white-washed railroad fence and we walked\nback a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg's persistent\nstare. The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick\nsitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street\nministering to it and contiguous to absolutely nothing. One of the\nthree shops it contained was for rent and another was an all-night\nrestaurant approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a\ngarage--Repairs. GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars Bought and Sold--and I followed\nTom inside.\n\nThe interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the\ndust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had\noccurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind and that\nsumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead when the\nproprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands\non a piece of waste. He was a blonde, spiritless man, anaemic, and\nfaintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his\nlight blue eyes.\n\n\"Hello, Wilson, old man,\" said Tom, slapping him jovially on the\nshoulder. \"How's business?\"\n\n\"I can't complain,\" answered Wilson unconvincingly. \"When are you going\nto sell me that car?\"\n\n\"Next week; I've got my man working on it now.\"\n\n\"Works pretty slow, don't he?\"\n\n\"No, he doesn't,\" said Tom coldly. \"And if you feel that way about it,\nmaybe I'd better sell it somewhere else after all.\"\n\n\"I don't mean that,\" explained Wilson quickly. \"I just meant----\"\n\nHis voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage. Then\nI heard footsteps on a stairs and in a moment the thickish figure of a\nwoman blocked out the light from the office door. She was in the middle\nthirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously\nas some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue\ncrepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty but there was an\nimmediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body\nwere continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and walking through her\nhusband as if he were a ghost shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in\nthe eye. Then she wet her lips and without turning around spoke to her\nhusband in a soft, coarse voice:\n\n\"Get some chairs, why don't you, so somebody can sit down.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" agreed Wilson hurriedly and went toward the little office,\nmingling immediately with the cement color of the walls. A white ashen\ndust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in\nthe vicinity--except his wife, who moved close to Tom.\n\n\"I want to see you,\" said Tom intently. \"Get on the next train.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\n\"I'll meet you by the news-stand on the lower level.\"\n\nShe nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson\nemerged with two chairs from his office door.\n\nWe waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days before\nthe Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting\ntorpedoes in a row along the railroad track.\n\n\"Terrible place, isn't it,\" said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor\nEckleburg.\n\n\"Awful.\"\n\n\"It does her good to get away.\"\n\n\"Doesn't her husband object?\"\n\n\"Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He's so dumb\nhe doesn't know he's alive.\"\n\nSo Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York--or not\nquite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom\ndeferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be\non the train.\n\nShe had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin which stretched\ntight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in\nNew York. At the news-stand she bought a copy of \"Town Tattle\" and a\nmoving-picture magazine and, in the station drug store, some cold cream\nand a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive\nshe let four taxi cabs drive away before she selected a new one,\nlavender-colored with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the\nmass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she\nturned sharply from the window and leaning forward tapped on the\nfront glass.\n\n\"I want to get one of those dogs,\" she said earnestly. \"I want to get one\nfor the apartment. They're nice to have--a dog.\"\n\nWe backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John\nD. Rockefeller. In a basket, swung from his neck, cowered a dozen very\nrecent puppies of an indeterminate breed.\n\n\"What kind are they?\" asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly as he came to the\ntaxi-window.\n\n\"All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?\"\n\n\"I'd like to get one of those police dogs; I don't suppose you got that\nkind?\"\n\nThe man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew\none up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.\n\n\"That's no police dog,\" said Tom.\n\n\"No, it's not exactly a polICE dog,\" said the man with disappointment\nin his voice. \"It's more of an airedale.\" He passed his hand over the\nbrown wash-rag of a back. \"Look at that coat. Some coat. That's a dog\nthat'll never bother you with catching cold.\"\n\n\"I think it's cute,\" said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. \"How much is it?\"\n\n\"That dog?\" He looked at it admiringly. \"That dog will cost you ten\ndollars.\"\n\nThe airedale--undoubtedly there was an airedale concerned in it somewhere\nthough its feet were startlingly white--changed hands and settled down\ninto Mrs. Wilson's lap, where she fondled the weather-proof coat with\nrapture.\n\n\"Is it a boy or a girl?\" she asked delicately.\n\n\"That dog? That dog's a boy.\"\n\n\"It's a bitch,\" said Tom decisively. \"Here's your money. Go and buy ten\nmore dogs with it.\"\n\nWe drove over to Fifth Avenue, so warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the\nsummer Sunday afternoon that I wouldn't have been surprised to see a great\nflock of white sheep turn the corner.\n\n\"Hold on,\" I said, \"I have to leave you here.\"\n\n\"No, you don't,\" interposed Tom quickly. \"Myrtle'll be hurt if you don't \ncome up to the apartment. Won't you,\nMyrtle?\"\n\n\"Come on,\" she urged. \"I'll telephone my sister Catherine. She's said to\nbe very beautiful by people who ought to know.\"\n\n\"Well, I'd like to, but----\"\n\nWe went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds.\nAt 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of\napartment houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the\nneighborhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases\nand went haughtily in.\n\n\"I'm going to have the McKees come up,\" she announced as we rose in the\nelevator. \"And of course I got to call up my sister, too.\"\n\nThe apartment was on the top floor--a small living room, a small\ndining room, a small bedroom and a bath. The living room was crowded to\nthe doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it\nso that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of\nladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was\nan over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred\nrock. Looked at from a distance however the hen resolved itself\ninto a bonnet and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down\ninto the room. Several old copies of \"Town Tattle \"lay on the table\ntogether with a copy of \"Simon Called Peter\" and some of the small\nscandal magazines of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with\nthe dog. A reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and\nsome milk to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large\nhard dog biscuits--one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer\nof milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whiskey\nfrom a locked bureau door.\n\nI have been drunk just twice in my life and the second time was that\nafternoon so everything that happened has a dim hazy cast over it\nalthough until after eight o'clock the apartment was full of cheerful\nsun. Sitting on Tom's lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the\ntelephone; then there were no cigarettes and I went out to buy some at\nthe drug store on the corner. When I came back they had disappeared so\nI sat down discreetly in the living room and read a chapter of \"Simon\nCalled Peter\"--either it was terrible stuff or the whiskey distorted\nthings because it didn't make any sense to me.\n\nJust as Tom and Myrtle--after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called\neach other by our first names--reappeared, company commenced to arrive\nat the apartment door.\n\nThe sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty\nwith a solid sticky bob of red hair and a complexion powdered milky\nwhite. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more\nrakish angle but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the\nold alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about\nthere was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets\njingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary\nhaste and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered\nif she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated\nmy question aloud and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel.\n\nMr. McKee was a pale feminine man from the flat below. He had just\nshaved for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone and he\nwas most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He\ninformed me that he was in the \"artistic game\" and I gathered later\nthat he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs.\nWilson's mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His wife\nwas shrill, languid, handsome and horrible. She told me with pride\nthat her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven times\nsince they had been married.\n\nMrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before and was now\nattired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream colored chiffon, which\ngave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room.\nWith the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a\nchange. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage\nwas converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her\nassertions became more violently affected moment by moment and as she\nexpanded the room grew smaller around her until she seemed to be\nrevolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.\n\n\"My dear,\" she told her sister in a high mincing shout, \"most of these\nfellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I had a\nwoman up here last week to look at my feet and when she gave me the\nbill you'd of thought she had my appendicitus out.\"\n\n\"What was the name of the woman?\" asked Mrs. McKee.\n\n\"Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people's feet in their own\nhomes.\"\n\n\"I like your dress,\" remarked Mrs. McKee, \"I think it's adorable.\"\n\nMrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.\n\n\"It's just a crazy old thing,\" she said. \"I just slip it on sometimes when\nI don't care what I look like.\"\n\n\"But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,\" pursued\nMrs. McKee. \"If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could\nmake something of it.\"\n\nWe all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson who removed a strand of hair from\nover her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee\nregarded her intently with his head on one side and then moved his hand\nback and forth slowly in front of his face.\n\n\"I should change the light,\" he said after a moment. \"I'd like to bring\nout the modelling of the features. And I'd try to get hold of all the\nback hair.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't think of changing the light,\" cried Mrs. McKee. \"I think\nit's----\"\n\nHer husband said \"SH!\" and we all looked at the subject again whereupon\nTom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.\n\n\"You McKees have something to drink,\" he said. \"Get some more ice and\nmineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.\"\n\n\"I told that boy about the ice.\" Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair\nat the shiftlessness of the lower orders. \"These people! You have to keep\nafter them all the time.\"\n\nShe looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the\ndog, kissed it with ecstasy and swept into the kitchen, implying that\na dozen chefs awaited her orders there.\n\n\"I've done some nice things out on Long Island,\" asserted Mr. McKee.\n\nTom looked at him blankly.\n\n\"Two of them we have framed downstairs.\"\n\n\"Two what?\" demanded Tom.\n\n\"Two studies. One of them I call 'Montauk Point--the Gulls,' and the\nother I call 'Montauk Point--the Sea.' \"\n\nThe sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.\n\n\"Do you live down on Long Island, too?\" she inquired.\n\n\"I live at West Egg.\"\n\n\"Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named\nGatsby's. Do you know him?\"\n\n\"I live next door to him.\"\n\n\"Well, they say he's a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm's. That's\nwhere all his money comes from.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"I'm scared of him. I'd hate to have him get anything on me.\"\n\nThis absorbing information about my neighbor was interrupted by\nMrs. McKee's pointing suddenly at Catherine:\n\n\"Chester, I think you could do something with HER,\" she broke out,\nbut Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way and turned his attention\nto Tom.\n\n\"I'd like to do more work on Long Island if I could get the entry. All\nI ask is that they should give me a start.\"\n\n\"Ask Myrtle,\" said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as\nMrs. Wilson entered with a tray. \"She'll give you a letter of\nintroduction, won't you, Myrtle?\"\n\n\"Do what?\" she asked, startled.\n\n\"You'll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can\ndo some studies of him.\" His lips moved silently for a moment as he\ninvented. \" 'George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,' or something like\nthat.\"\n\n\nCatherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear: \"Neither of them\ncan stand the person they're married to.\"\n\n\"Can't they?\"\n\n\"Can't STAND them.\" She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. \"What I say is,\nwhy go on living with them if they can't stand them? If I was them I'd get\na divorce and get married to each other right away.\"\n\n\"Doesn't she like Wilson either?\"\n\nThe answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle who had overheard\nthe question and it was violent and obscene.\n\n\"You see?\" cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again.\n\"It's really his wife that's keeping them apart. She's a Catholic and\nthey don't believe in divorce.\"\n\nDaisy was not a Catholic and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness\nof the lie.\n\n\"When they do get married,\" continued Catherine, \"they're going west to\nlive for a while until it blows over.\"\n\n\"It'd be more discreet to go to Europe.\"\n\n\"Oh, do you like Europe?\" she exclaimed surprisingly. \"I just got back\nfrom Monte Carlo.\"\n\n\"Really.\"\n\n\"Just last year. I went over there with another girl.\"\n\n\"Stay long?\"\n\n\"No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way of Marseilles.\nWe had over twelve hundred dollars when we started but we got gypped\nout of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had an awful time\ngetting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town!\"\n\nThe late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue\nhoney of the Mediterranean--then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me\nback into the room.\n\n\"I almost made a mistake, too,\" she declared vigorously. \"I almost\nmarried a little kyke who'd been after me for years. I knew he was\nbelow me. Everybody kept saying to me: 'Lucille, that man's way below\nyou!' But if I hadn't met Chester, he'd of got me sure.\"\n\n\"Yes, but listen,\" said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down,\n\"at least you didn't marry him.\"\n\n\"I know I didn't.\"\n\n\"Well, I married him,\" said Myrtle, ambiguously. \"And that's the\ndifference between your case and mine.\"\n\n\"Why did you, Myrtle?\" demanded Catherine. \"Nobody forced you to.\"\n\nMyrtle considered.\n\n\"I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,\" she said finally.\n\"I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn't fit to lick\nmy shoe.\"\n\n\"You were crazy about him for a while,\" said Catherine.\n\n\"Crazy about him!\" cried Myrtle incredulously. \"Who said I was crazy about\nhim? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man\nthere.\"\n\nShe pointed suddenly at me, and every one looked at me accusingly.\nI tried to show by my expression that I had played no part in her past.\n\n\"The only CRAZY I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made a\nmistake. He borrowed somebody's best suit to get married in and never\neven told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he was out.\nShe looked around to see who was listening: \" 'Oh, is that your suit?' I \nsaid.\n'This is the first I ever heard about it.' But I gave it to him and then I \nlay down\nand cried to beat the band all afternoon.\"\n\n\"She really ought to get away from him,\" resumed Catherine to me.\n\"They've been living over that garage for eleven years. And Tom's the\nfirst sweetie she ever had.\"\n\nThe bottle of whiskey--a second one--was now in constant demand by all\npresent, excepting Catherine who \"felt just as good on nothing at all.\"\nTom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches,\nwhich were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted to get out and walk\neastward toward the park through the soft twilight but each time I tried\nto go I became entangled in some wild strident argument which pulled me\nback, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city our line of\nyellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the\ncasual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and\nwondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled\nby the inexhaustible variety of life.\n\nMyrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath\npoured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.\n\n\"It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the\nlast ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my\nsister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather\nshoes and I couldn't keep my eyes off him but every time he looked at\nme I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head.\nWhen we came into the station he was next to me and his white\nshirt-front pressed against my arm--and so I told him I'd have to call\na policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into\na taxi with him I didn't hardly know I wasn't getting into a subway\ntrain. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was 'You can't live\nforever, you can't live forever.' \"\n\nShe turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial\nlaughter.\n\n\"My dear,\" she cried, \"I'm going to give you this dress as soon as I'm\nthrough with it. I've got to get another one tomorrow. I'm going to\nmake a list of all the things I've got to get. A massage and a wave\nand a collar for the dog and one of those cute little ash-trays where\nyou touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother's\ngrave that'll last all summer. I got to write down a list so I won't\nforget all the things I got to do.\"\n\nIt was nine o'clock--almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch\nand found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists\nclenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out my\nhandkerchief I wiped from his cheek the remains of the spot of dried\nlather that had worried me all the afternoon.\n\nThe little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through\nthe smoke and from time to time groaning faintly. People disappeared,\nreappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other,\nsearched for each other, found each other a few feet away. Some time\ntoward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face\ndiscussing in impassioned voices whether Mrs. Wilson had any right to\nmention Daisy's name.\n\n\"Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!\" shouted Mrs. Wilson. \"I'll say it whenever I want\nto! Daisy! Dai----\"\n\nMaking a short deft movement Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his\nopen hand.\n\nThen there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women's\nvoices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of\npain. Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the door.\nWhen he had gone half way he turned around and stared at the scene--his\nwife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and\nthere among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and the\ndespairing figure on the couch bleeding fluently and trying to spread\na copy of \"Town Tattle\" over the tapestry scenes of Versailles.\nThen Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the door. Taking my hat from\nthe chandelier I followed.\n\n\"Come to lunch some day,\" he suggested, as we groaned down in the\nelevator.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Anywhere.\"\n\n\"Keep your hands off the lever,\" snapped the elevator boy.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. McKee with dignity, \"I didn't know I was\ntouching it.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I agreed, \"I'll be glad to.\"\n\n. . . I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the\nsheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.\n\n\"Beauty and the Beast . . . Loneliness . . . Old Grocery Horse . . .\nBrook'n Bridge . . . .\"\n\nThen I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the Pennsylvania\nStation, staring at the morning \"Tribune\" and waiting for the four\no'clock train.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n\n\nThere was music from my neighbor's house through the summer nights. In\nhis blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the\nwhisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the\nafternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft or\ntaking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats\nslit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of\nfoam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties\nto and from the city, between nine in the morning and long past\nmidnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to\nmeet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants including an extra\ngardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers\nand garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.\n\nEvery Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer\nin New York--every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back\ndoor in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the\nkitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an\nhour, if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler's\nthumb.\n\nAt least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several\nhundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas\ntree of Gatsby's enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with\nglistening hors-d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of\nharlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold.\nIn the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked\nwith gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of\nhis female guests were too young to know one from another.\n\nBy seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived--no thin five-piece affair\nbut a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and\ncornets and piccolos and low and high drums. The last swimmers have\ncome in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from\nNew York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and\nsalons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors and hair shorn in\nstrange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The\nbar is in full swing and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the\ngarden outside until the air is alive with chatter and laughter and\ncasual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and\nenthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names.\n\nThe lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and\nnow the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music and the opera of\nvoices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier, minute by minute,\nspilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups\nchange more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the\nsame breath--already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave\nhere and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp,\njoyous moment the center of a group and then excited with triumph\nglide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the\nconstantly changing light.\n\nSuddenly one of these gypsies in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out\nof the air, dumps it down for courage and moving her hands like\nFrisco dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; the\norchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her and there is a\nburst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda\nGray's understudy from the \"Follies.\" The party has begun.\n\nI believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby's house I was one of\nthe few guests who had actually been invited. People were not\ninvited--they went there. They got into automobiles which bore them out\nto Long Island and somehow they ended up at Gatsby's door. Once there\nthey were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby and after that they\nconducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with\namusement parks. Sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby\nat all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own\nticket of admission.\n\nI had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of robin's egg\nblue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly\nformal note from his employer--the honor would be entirely Gatsby's, it\nsaid, if I would attend his \"little party\" that night. He had\nseen me several times and had intended to call on me long before\nbut a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it--signed\nJay Gatsby in a majestic hand.\n\nDressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after\nseven and wandered around rather ill-at-ease among swirls and eddies\nof people I didn't know--though here and there was a face I had noticed\non the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number of young\nEnglishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry\nand all talking in low earnest voices to solid and prosperous\nAmericans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or\ninsurance or automobiles. They were, at least, agonizingly aware of the\neasy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few\nwords in the right key.\n\nAs soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host but the two or\nthree people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an\namazed way and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements\nthat I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table--the only place\nin the garden where a single man could linger without looking\npurposeless and alone.\n\nI was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when\nJordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble\nsteps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest\ndown into the garden.\n\nWelcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone\nbefore I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passers-by.\n\n\"Hello!\" I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturally\nloud across the garden.\n\n\"I thought you might be here,\" she responded absently as I came up.\n\"I remembered you lived next door to----\"\n\nShe held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she'd take care\nof me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses\nwho stopped at the foot of the steps.\n\n\"Hello!\" they cried together. \"Sorry you didn't win.\"\n\nThat was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week\nbefore.\n\n\"You don't know who we are,\" said one of the girls in yellow, \"but we\nmet you here about a month ago.\"\n\n\"You've dyed your hair since then,\" remarked Jordan, and I started\nbut the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the\npremature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer's\nbasket. With Jordan's slender golden arm resting in mine we descended\nthe steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated at\nus through the twilight and we sat down at a table with the two girls in\nyellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble.\n\n\"Do you come to these parties often?\" inquired Jordan of the girl\nbeside her.\n\n\"The last one was the one I met you at,\" answered the girl, in an alert,\nconfident voice. She turned to her companion: \"Wasn't it for you,\nLucille?\"\n\nIt was for Lucille, too.\n\n\"I like to come,\" Lucille said. \"I never care what I do, so I always have\na good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked\nme my name and address--inside of a week I got a package from Croirier's\nwith a new evening gown in it.\"\n\n\"Did you keep it?\" asked Jordan.\n\n\"Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the\nbust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two\nhundred and sixty-five dollars.\"\n\n\"There's something funny about a fellow that'll do a thing like that,\"\nsaid the other girl eagerly. \"He doesn't want any trouble with ANYbody.\"\n\n\"Who doesn't?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Gatsby. Somebody told me----\"\n\nThe two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.\n\n\"Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.\"\n\nA thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and\nlistened eagerly.\n\n\"I don't think it's so much THAT,\" argued Lucille skeptically; \"it's\nmore that he was a German spy during the war.\"\n\nOne of the men nodded in confirmation.\n\n\"I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in\nGermany,\" he assured us positively.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said the first girl, \"it couldn't be that, because he was in\nthe American army during the war.\" As our credulity switched back to\nher she leaned forward with enthusiasm. \"You look at him sometimes when\nhe thinks nobody's looking at him. I'll bet he killed a man.\"\n\nShe narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned and\nlooked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic speculation he\ninspired that there were whispers about him from those who found little\nthat it was necessary to whisper about in this world.\n\nThe first supper--there would be another one after midnight--was now\nbeing served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party who were\nspread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were\nthree married couples and Jordan's escort, a persistent undergraduate\ngiven to violent innuendo and obviously under the impression\nthat sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person\nto a greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling this party\nhad preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the\nfunction of representing the staid nobility of the countryside--East\nEgg condescending to West Egg, and carefully on guard against its\nspectroscopic gayety.\n\n\"Let's get out,\" whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and\ninappropriate half hour. \"This is much too polite for me.\"\n\nWe got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host--I\nhad never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The\nundergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.\n\nThe bar, where we glanced first, was crowded but Gatsby was not there.\nShe couldn't find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn't on the\nveranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked\ninto a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and\nprobably transported complete from some ruin overseas.\n\nA stout, middle-aged man with enormous owl-eyed spectacles was\nsitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with\nunsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he\nwheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.\n\n\"What do you think?\" he demanded impetuously.\n\n\"About what?\"\n\nHe waved his hand toward the book-shelves.\n\n\"About that. As a matter of fact you needn't bother to ascertain. I\nascertained. They're real.\"\n\n\"The books?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Absolutely real--have pages and everything. I thought they'd be a nice\ndurable cardboard. Matter of fact, they're absolutely real. Pages\nand--Here! Lemme show you.\"\n\nTaking our skepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and\nreturned with Volume One of the \"Stoddard Lectures.\"\n\n\"See!\" he cried triumphantly. \"It's a bona fide piece of printed matter.\nIt fooled me. This fella's a regular Belasco. It's a triumph. What\nthoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop too--didn't cut the pages.\nBut what do you want? What do you expect?\"\n\nHe snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf\nmuttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable\nto collapse.\n\n\"Who brought you?\" he demanded. \"Or did you just come? I was brought.\nMost people were brought.\"\n\nJordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully without answering.\n\n\"I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,\" he continued. \"Mrs. Claud\nRoosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I've\nbeen drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me\nup to sit in a library.\"\n\n\"Has it?\"\n\n\"A little bit, I think. I can't tell yet. I've only been here\nan hour. Did I tell you about the books? They're real. They're----\"\n\n\"You told us.\"\n\nWe shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.\n\nThere was dancing now on the canvas in the garden, old men pushing\nyoung girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples\nholding each other tortuously, fashionably and keeping in the\ncorners--and a great number of single girls dancing individualistically\nor relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or\nthe traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had\nsung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz and between\nthe numbers people were doing \"stunts\" all over the garden, while happy\nvacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage\n\"twins\"--who turned out to be the girls in yellow--did a baby act in\ncostume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger bowls.\nThe moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of\nsilver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the\nbanjoes on the lawn.\n\nI was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of\nabout my age and a rowdy little girl who gave way upon the slightest\nprovocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now. I\nhad taken two finger bowls of champagne and the scene had changed\nbefore my eyes into something significant, elemental and profound.\n\nAt a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.\n\n\"Your face is familiar,\" he said, politely. \"Weren't you in the Third\nDivision during the war?\"\n\n\"Why, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-Gun Battalion.\"\n\n\"I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I'd\nseen you somewhere before.\"\n\nWe talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France.\nEvidently he lived in this vicinity for he told me that he had just\nbought a hydroplane and was going to try it out in the morning.\n\n\"Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.\"\n\n\"What time?\"\n\n\"Any time that suits you best.\"\n\nIt was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around\nand smiled.\n\n\"Having a gay time now?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Much better.\" I turned again to my new acquaintance. \"This is an unusual\nparty for me. I haven't even seen the host. I live over there----\" I waved\nmy hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, \"and this man Gatsby sent\nover his chauffeur with an invitation.\"\n\nFor a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.\n\n\"I'm Gatsby,\" he said suddenly.\n\n\"What!\" I exclaimed. \"Oh, I beg your pardon.\"\n\n\"I thought you knew, old sport. I'm afraid I'm not a very good host.\"\n\nHe smiled understandingly--much more than understandingly. It was\none of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance\nin it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or\nseemed to face--the whole external world for an instant, and then\nconcentrated on YOU with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It\nunderstood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in\nyou as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it\nhad precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to\nconvey. Precisely at that point it vanished--and I was looking at an\nelegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate\nformality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he\nintroduced himself I'd got a strong impression that he was picking his\nwords with care.\n\nAlmost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler\nhurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on\nthe wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us\nin turn.\n\n\"If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,\" he urged me.\n\"Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.\"\n\nWhen he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan--constrained to assure her\nof my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and\ncorpulent person in his middle years.\n\n\"Who is he?\" I demanded. \"Do you know?\"\n\n\"He's just a man named Gatsby.\"\n\n\"Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?\"\n\n\"Now YOU're started on the subject,\" she answered with a wan smile.\n\"Well,--he told me once he was an Oxford man.\"\n\nA dim background started to take shape behind him but at her\nnext remark it faded away.\n\n\"However, I don't believe it.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she insisted, \"I just don't think he went there.\"\n\nSomething in her tone reminded me of the other girl's \"I think\nhe killed a man,\" and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I\nwould have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang\nfrom the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York.\nThat was comprehensible. But young men didn't--at least in my provincial\ninexperience I believed they didn't--drift coolly out of nowhere and buy\na palace on Long Island Sound.\n\n\"Anyhow he gives large parties,\" said Jordan, changing the subject\nwith an urbane distaste for the concrete. \"And I like large parties.\nThey're so intimate. At small parties there isn't any privacy.\"\n\nThere was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader\nrang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he cried. \"At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are\ngoing to play for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff's latest work which attracted\nso much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers\nyou know there was a big sensation.\" He smiled with jovial condescension\nand added \"Some sensation!\" whereupon everybody laughed.\n\n\"The piece is known,\" he concluded lustily, \"as 'Vladimir Tostoff's\nJazz History of the World.' \"\n\nThe nature of Mr. Tostoff's composition eluded me, because just as\nit began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps\nand looking from one group to another with approving eyes.\nHis tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and\nhis short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day. I could\nsee nothing sinister about him. I wondered if the fact that he was\nnot drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed\nto me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased.\nWhen the \"Jazz History of the World\" was over girls were putting\ntheir heads on men's shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were\nswooning backward playfully into men's arms, even into groups knowing\nthat some one would arrest their falls--but no one swooned backward on\nGatsby and no French bob touched Gatsby's shoulder and no singing\nquartets were formed with Gatsby's head for one link.\n\n\"I beg your pardon.\"\n\nGatsby's butler was suddenly standing beside us.\n\n\"Miss Baker?\" he inquired. \"I beg your pardon but Mr. Gatsby would like\nto speak to you alone.\"\n\n\"With me?\" she exclaimed in surprise.\n\n\"Yes, madame.\"\n\nShe got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment,\nand followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore\nher evening dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes--there\nwas a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to\nwalk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.\n\nI was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and\nintriguing sounds had issued from a long many-windowed room which\noverhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan's undergraduate who was now\nengaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who\nimplored me to join him, I went inside.\n\nThe large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was\nplaying the piano and beside her stood a tall, red haired young lady\nfrom a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of\nchampagne and during the course of her song she had decided ineptly\nthat everything was very very sad--she was not only singing, she was\nweeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with\ngasping broken sobs and then took up the lyric again in a quavering\nsoprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks--not freely, however, for when\nthey came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an\ninky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. A\nhumorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face\nwhereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair and went off into\na deep vinous sleep.\n\n\"She had a fight with a man who says he's her husband,\" explained a\ngirl at my elbow.\n\nI looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights\nwith men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan's party, the quartet\nfrom East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was\ntalking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife after\nattempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent\nway broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks--at intervals she\nappeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed \"You\npromised!\" into his ear.\n\nThe reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall was at\npresent occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant\nwives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised\nvoices.\n\n\"Whenever he sees I'm having a good time he wants to go home.\"\n\n\"Never heard anything so selfish in my life.\"\n\n\"We're always the first ones to leave.\"\n\n\"So are we.\"\n\n\"Well, we're almost the last tonight,\" said one of the men sheepishly.\n\"The orchestra left half an hour ago.\"\n\nIn spite of the wives' agreement that such malevolence was beyond\ncredibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were\nlifted kicking into the night.\n\nAs I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and\nJordan Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last word\nto her but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into\nformality as several people approached him to say goodbye.\n\nJordan's party were calling impatiently to her from the porch but she\nlingered for a moment to shake hands.\n\n\"I've just heard the most amazing thing,\" she whispered. \"How long were\nwe in there?\"\n\n\"Why,--about an hour.\"\n\n\"It was--simply amazing,\" she repeated abstractedly. \"But I swore\nI wouldn't tell it and here I am tantalizing you.\" She yawned\ngracefully in my face. \"Please come and see me. . . . Phone book.\n. . . Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard. . . . My aunt. . . .\"\nShe was hurrying off as she talked--her brown hand waved a\njaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door.\n\nRather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I\njoined the last of Gatsby's guests who were clustered around him. I\nwanted to explain that I'd hunted for him early in the evening and to\napologize for not having known him in the garden.\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" he enjoined me eagerly. \"Don't give it another\nthought, old sport.\" The familiar expression held no more familiarity\nthan the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. \"And don't forget\nwe're going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning at nine o'clock.\"\n\nThen the butler, behind his shoulder:\n\n\"Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.\"\n\n\"All right, in a minute. Tell them I'll be right there. . . . good\nnight.\"\n\n\"Good night.\"\n\n\"Good night.\" He smiled--and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant\nsignificance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired\nit all the time. \"Good night, old sport. . . . Good night.\"\n\nBut as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over.\nFifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and\ntumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side up but\nviolently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coup\u00e9 which had left Gatsby's\ndrive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the\ndetachment of the wheel which was now getting considerable attention from\nhalf a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as they had left their cars\nblocking the road a harsh discordant din from those in the rear had been\naudible for some time and added to the already violent confusion of\nthe scene.\n\nA man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in\nthe middle of the road, looking from the car to the tire and from the\ntire to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.\n\n\"See!\" he explained. \"It went in the ditch.\"\n\nThe fact was infinitely astonishing to him--and I recognized first the\nunusual quality of wonder and then the man--it was the late patron of\nGatsby's library.\n\n\"How'd it happen?\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I know nothing whatever about mechanics,\" he said decisively.\n\n\"But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?\"\n\n\"Don't ask me,\" said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter.\n\"I know very little about driving--next to nothing. It happened,\nand that's all I know.\"\n\n\"Well, if you're a poor driver you oughtn't to try driving at night.\"\n\n\"But I wasn't even trying,\" he explained indignantly, \"I wasn't even\ntrying.\"\n\nAn awed hush fell upon the bystanders.\n\n\"Do you want to commit suicide?\"\n\n\"You're lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even TRYing!\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" explained the criminal. \"I wasn't driving. There's\nanother man in the car.\"\n\nThe shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained\n\"Ah-h-h!\" as the door of the coup\u00e9 swung slowly open. The crowd--it was\nnow a crowd--stepped back involuntarily and when the door had opened wide\nthere was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale\ndangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the\nground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.\n\nBlinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant\ngroaning of the horns the apparition stood swaying for a moment before\nhe perceived the man in the duster.\n\n\"Wha's matter?\" he inquired calmly. \"Did we run outa gas?\"\n\n\"Look!\"\n\nHalf a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel--he stared\nat it for a moment and then looked upward as though he suspected that\nit had dropped from the sky.\n\n\"It came off,\" some one explained.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"At first I din' notice we'd stopped.\"\n\nA pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders\nhe remarked in a determined voice:\n\n\"Wonder'ff tell me where there's a gas'line station?\"\n\nAt least a dozen men, some of them little better off than he was,\nexplained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical\nbond.\n\n\"Back out,\" he suggested after a moment. \"Put her in reverse.\"\n\n\"But the WHEEL'S off!\"\n\nHe hesitated.\n\n\"No harm in trying,\" he said.\n\nThe caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and\ncut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a moon\nwas shining over Gatsby's house, making the night fine as before and\nsurviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. A\nsudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great\ndoors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host who\nstood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.\n\n\nReading over what I have written so far I see I have given the\nimpression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all\nthat absorbed me. On the contrary they were merely casual events in a\ncrowded summer and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less\nthan my personal affairs.\n\nMost of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my shadow\nwestward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the\nProbity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their\nfirst names and lunched with them in dark crowded restaurants on\nlittle pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I even had a short\naffair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the\naccounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my\ndirection so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow\nquietly away.\n\nI took dinner usually at the Yale Club--for some reason it was the\ngloomiest event of my day--and then I went upstairs to the library and\nstudied investments and securities for a conscientious hour.\nThere were generally a few rioters around but they never came into the\nlibrary so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was\nmellow I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel\nand over Thirty-third Street to the Pennsylvania Station.\n\nI began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night\nand the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and\nmachines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and\npick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few\nminutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever\nknow or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their\napartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled\nback at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the\nenchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes,\nand felt it in others--poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows\nwaiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner--young clerks\nin the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.\n\nAgain at eight o'clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were five\ndeep with throbbing taxi cabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a\nsinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited,\nand voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted\ncigarettes outlined unintelligible gestures inside. Imagining that\nI, too, was hurrying toward gayety and sharing their intimate\nexcitement, I wished them well.\n\nFor a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found\nher again. At first I was flattered to go places with her because she\nwas a golf champion and every one knew her name. Then it was\nsomething more. I wasn't actually in love, but I felt a sort of\ntender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the\nworld concealed something--most affectations conceal something\neventually, even though they don't in the beginning--and one day I found\nwhat it was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she\nleft a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied\nabout it--and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded\nme that night at Daisy's. At her first big golf tournament there was a\nrow that nearly reached the newspapers--a suggestion that she had moved\nher ball from a bad lie in the semi-final round. The thing approached\nthe proportions of a scandal--then died away. A caddy retracted his\nstatement and the only other witness admitted that he might have been\nmistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.\n\nJordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw\nthat this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence\nfrom a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest.\nShe wasn't able to endure being at a disadvantage, and given this\nunwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she\nwas very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the\nworld and yet satisfy the demands of her hard jaunty body.\n\nIt made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never\nblame deeply--I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that\nsame house party that we had a curious conversation about driving a\ncar. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our\nfender flicked a button on one man's coat.\n\n\"You're a rotten driver,\" I protested. \"Either you ought to be more\ncareful or you oughtn't to drive at all.\"\n\n\"I am careful.\"\n\n\"No, you're not.\"\n\n\"Well, other people are,\" she said lightly.\n\n\"What's that got to do with it?\"\n\n\"They'll keep out of my way,\" she insisted. \"It takes two to make an\naccident.\"\n\n\"Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.\"\n\n\"I hope I never will,\" she answered. \"I hate careless people. That's why\nI like you.\"\n\nHer grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had\ndeliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved\nher. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes\non my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of\nthat tangle back home. I'd been writing letters once a week and signing\nthem: \"Love, Nick,\" and all I could think of was how, when that certain\ngirl played tennis, a faint mustache of perspiration appeared on her\nupper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be\ntactfully broken off before I was free.\n\nEvery one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and\nthis is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n\n\nOn Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages along shore\nthe world and its mistress returned to Gatsby's house and twinkled\nhilariously on his lawn.\n\n\"He's a bootlegger,\" said the young ladies, moving somewhere between\nhis cocktails and his flowers. \"One time he killed a man who had found out\nthat he was nephew to von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil.\nReach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there crystal\nglass.\"\n\nOnce I wrote down on the empty spaces of a time-table the names\nof those who came to Gatsby's house that summer. It is an old time-table\nnow, disintegrating at its folds and headed \"This schedule in effect\nJuly 5th, 1922.\" But I can still read the grey names and they will give\nyou a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted\nGatsby's hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing\nwhatever about him.\n\nFrom East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches and a\nman named Bunsen whom I knew at Yale and Doctor Webster Civet who\nwas drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie\nVoltaires and a whole clan named Blackbuck who always gathered in a\ncorner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near.\nAnd the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr.\nChrystie's wife) and Edgar Beaver, whose hair they say turned\ncotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.\n\nClarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only\nonce, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named\nEtty in the garden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles\nand the O. R. P. Schraeders and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of\nGeorgia and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there\nthree days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the\ngravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett's automobile ran over his right\nhand. The Dancies came too and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over\nsixty, and Maurice A. Flink and the Hammerheads and Beluga the\ntobacco importer and Beluga's girls.\n\nFrom West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and\nCecil Schoen and Gulick the state senator and Newton Orchid who\ncontrolled Films Par Excellence and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don\nS. Schwartze (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the\nmovies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G.\nEarl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife.\nDa Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B.\n(\"Rot-Gut\") Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly--they came to\ngamble and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was\ncleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably\nnext day.\n\nA man named Klipspringer was there so often and so long that he became\nknown as \"the boarder\"--I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical\npeople there were Gus Waize and Horace O'Donavan and Lester Meyer and\nGeorge Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes\nand the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the\nCorrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W.\nBelcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry\nL. Palmetto who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train\nin Times Square.\n\nBenny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite\nthe same ones in physical person but they were so identical one with\nanother that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have\nforgotten their names--Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela or Gloria\nor Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names\nof flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American\ncapitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves to\nbe.\n\nIn addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O'Brien came\nthere at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer who had\nhis nose shot off in the war and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his\nfianc\u00e9e, and Ardita Fitz-Peters, and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of the\nAmerican Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip with a man reputed to be her\nchauffeur, and a prince of something whom we called Duke and whose name,\nif I ever knew it, I have forgotten.\n\nAll these people came to Gatsby's house in the summer.\n\n\nAt nine o'clock, one morning late in July Gatsby's gorgeous car\nlurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody\nfrom its three noted horn. It was the first time he had called on me\nthough I had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane,\nand, at his urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach.\n\n\"Good morning, old sport. You're having lunch with me today and I\nthought we'd ride up together.\"\n\nHe was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that\nresourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American--that comes,\nI suppose, with the absence of lifting work or rigid sitting in youth\nand, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games.\nThis quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in\nthe shape of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a\ntapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.\n\nHe saw me looking with admiration at his car.\n\n\"It's pretty, isn't it, old sport.\" He jumped off to give me a better\nview. \"Haven't you ever seen it before?\"\n\nI'd seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream color, bright\nwith nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with\ntriumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a\nlabyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind\nmany layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory we started\nto town.\n\nI had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and\nfound, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first\nimpression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had\ngradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate\nroadhouse next door.\n\nAnd then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn't reached West Egg\nvillage before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished\nand slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-colored\nsuit.\n\n\"Look here, old sport,\" he broke out surprisingly. \"What's your opinion\nof me, anyhow?\"\n\nA little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which\nthat question deserves.\n\n\"Well, I'm going to tell you something about my life,\" he interrupted.\n\"I don't want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you\nhear.\"\n\nSo he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavored conversation in\nhis halls.\n\n\"I'll tell you God's truth.\" His right hand suddenly ordered divine\nretribution to stand by. \"I am the son of some wealthy people in the\nmiddle-west--all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at\nOxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years.\nIt is a family tradition.\"\n\nHe looked at me sideways--and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was\nlying. He hurried the phrase \"educated at Oxford,\" or swallowed it or\nchoked on it as though it had bothered him before. And with this doubt\nhis whole statement fell to pieces and I wondered if there wasn't\nsomething a little sinister about him after all.\n\n\"What part of the middle-west?\" I inquired casually.\n\n\"San Francisco.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\n\"My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.\"\n\nHis voice was solemn as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan\nstill haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg\nbut a glance at him convinced me otherwise.\n\n\"After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of\nEurope--Paris, Venice, Rome--collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting\nbig game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to\nforget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.\"\n\nWith an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very\nphrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a\nturbaned \"character\" leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a\ntiger through the Bois de Boulogne.\n\n\"Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief and I tried very\nhard to die but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a\ncommission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I\ntook two machine-gun detachments so far forward that there was a half\nmile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn't advance. We\nstayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty men with\nsixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last they found\nthe insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead. I was\npromoted to be a major and every Allied government gave me a\ndecoration--even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic\nSea!\"\n\nLittle Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them--with\nhis smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro's troubled history and\nsympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It\nappreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had\nelicited this tribute from Montenegro's warm little heart. My\nincredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming\nhastily through a dozen magazines.\n\nHe reached in his pocket and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon, fell\ninto my palm.\n\n\"That's the one from Montenegro.\"\n\nTo my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look.\n\n_Orderi di Danilo_, ran the circular legend, _Montenegro, Nicolas Rex_.\n\n\"Turn it.\"\n\n_Major Jay Gatsby_, I read, _For Valour Extraordinary_.\n\n\"Here's another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It was\ntaken in Trinity Quad--the man on my left is now the Earl of Dorcaster.\"\n\nIt was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an\narchway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby,\nlooking a little, not much, younger--with a cricket bat in his hand.\n\nThen it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace\non the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with\ntheir crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.\n\n\"I'm going to make a big request of you today,\" he said, pocketing his\nsouvenirs with satisfaction, \"so I thought you ought to know something\nabout me. I didn't want you to think I was just some nobody. You see,\nI usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there\ntrying to forget the sad thing that happened to me.\" He hesitated.\n\"You'll hear about it this afternoon.\"\n\n\"At lunch?\"\n\n\"No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you're taking Miss Baker\nto tea.\"\n\n\"Do you mean you're in love with Miss Baker?\"\n\n\"No, old sport, I'm not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak\nto you about this matter.\"\n\nI hadn't the faintest idea what \"this matter\" was, but I was more\nannoyed than interested. I hadn't asked Jordan to tea in order to discuss\nMr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something utterly\nfantastic and for a moment I was sorry I'd ever set foot upon his\noverpopulated lawn.\n\nHe wouldn't say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared\nthe city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of\nred-belted ocean-going ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with\nthe dark, undeserted saloons of the faded gilt nineteen-hundreds. Then\nthe valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a glimpse\nof Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we\nwent by.\n\nWith fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half\nAstoria--only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the\nelevated I heard the familiar \"jug--jug--SPAT!\" of a motor cycle, and a\nfrantic policeman rode alongside.\n\n\"All right, old sport,\" called Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a white\ncard from his wallet he waved it before the man's eyes.\n\n\"Right you are,\" agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. \"Know you next\ntime, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse ME!\"\n\n\"What was that?\" I inquired.  \"The picture of Oxford?\"\n\n\"I was able to do the commissioner a favor once, and he sends me a\nChristmas card every year.\"\n\nOver the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a\nconstant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the\nriver in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of\nnon-olfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always\nthe city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the\nmystery and the beauty in the world.\n\nA dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two\ncarriages with drawn blinds and by more cheerful carriages for\nfriends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short\nupper lips of south-eastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of\nGatsby's splendid car was included in their somber holiday. As we\ncrossed Blackwell's Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white\nchauffeur, in which sat three modish Negroes, two bucks and a girl. I\nlaughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in\nhaughty rivalry.\n\n\"Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge,\" I thought;\n\"anything at all. . . .\"\n\nEven Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.\n\n\nRoaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby\nfor lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside my eyes\npicked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.\n\n\"Mr. Carraway this is my friend Mr. Wolfsheim.\"\n\nA small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two\nfine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I\ndiscovered his tiny eyes in the half darkness.\n\n\"--so I took one look at him--\" said Mr. Wolfsheim, shaking my hand\nearnestly, \"--and what do you think I did?\"\n\n\"What?\" I inquired politely.\n\nBut evidently he was not addressing me for he dropped my hand and\ncovered Gatsby with his expressive nose.\n\n\"I handed the money to Katspaugh and I sid, 'All right, Katspaugh,\ndon't pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.' He shut it then and\nthere.\"\n\nGatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the\nrestaurant whereupon Mr. Wolfsheim swallowed a new sentence he was\nstarting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.\n\n\"Highballs?\" asked the head waiter.\n\n\"This is a nice restaurant here,\" said Mr. Wolfsheim looking at the\nPresbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. \"But I like across the street better!\"\n\n\"Yes, highballs,\" agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfsheim: \"It's too hot\nover there.\"\n\n\"Hot and small--yes,\" said Mr. Wolfsheim, \"but full of memories.\"\n\n\"What place is that?\" I asked.\n\n\"The old Metropole.\n\n\"The old Metropole,\" brooded Mr. Wolfsheim gloomily. \"Filled with faces\ndead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can't forget so\nlong as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It was six of us\nat the table and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening. When it was\nalmost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says\nsomebody wants to speak to him outside. 'All right,' says Rosy and begins\nto get up and I pulled him down in his chair.\n\n\" 'Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don't you,\nso help me, move outside this room.'\n\n\"It was four o'clock in the morning then, and if we'd of raised the blinds\nwe'd of seen daylight.\"\n\n\"Did he go?\" I asked innocently.\n\n\"Sure he went,\"--Mr. Wolfsheim's nose flashed at me indignantly--\"He\nturned around in the door and says, 'Don't let that waiter take away\nmy coffee!' Then he went out on the sidewalk and they shot him\nthree times in his full belly and drove away.\"\n\n\"Four of them were electrocuted,\" I said, remembering.\n\n\"Five with Becker.\" His nostrils turned to me in an interested way.\n\"I understand you're looking for a business gonnegtion.\"\n\nThe juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered\nfor me:\n\n\"Oh, no,\" he exclaimed, \"this isn't the man!\"\n\n\"No?\" Mr. Wolfsheim seemed disappointed.\n\n\"This is just a friend. I told you we'd talk about that some other\ntime.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. Wolfsheim, \"I had a wrong man.\"\n\nA succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfsheim, forgetting the more\nsentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with\nferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the\nroom--he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly\nbehind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have taken one\nshort glance beneath our own table.\n\n\"Look here, old sport,\" said Gatsby, leaning toward me, \"I'm afraid I\nmade you a little angry this morning in the car.\"\n\nThere was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.\n\n\"I don't like mysteries,\" I answered. \"And I don't understand why you\nwon't come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got to\ncome through Miss Baker?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing underhand,\" he assured me. \"Miss Baker's a great\nsportswoman, you know, and she'd never do anything that wasn't all right.\"\n\nSuddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up and hurried from the room\nleaving me with Mr. Wolfsheim at the table.\n\n\"He has to telephone,\" said Mr. Wolfsheim, following him with his eyes.\n\"Fine fellow, isn't he? Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"He's an Oggsford man.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?\"\n\n\"I've heard of it.\"\n\n\"It's one of the most famous colleges in the world.\"\n\n\"Have you known Gatsby for a long time?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Several years,\" he answered in a gratified way. \"I made the pleasure of\nhis acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a man of\nfine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to myself: 'There's\nthe kind of man you'd like to take home and introduce to your mother and\nsister.' \" He paused. \"I see you're looking at my cuff buttons.\"\n\nI hadn't been looking at them, but I did now.  They were composed of\noddly familiar pieces of ivory.\n\n\"Finest specimens of human molars,\" he informed me.\n\n\"Well!\" I inspected them. \"That's a very interesting idea.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. \"Yeah, Gatsby's very\ncareful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend's wife.\"\n\nWhen the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat\ndown Mr. Wolfsheim drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet.\n\n\"I have enjoyed my lunch,\" he said, \"and I'm going to run off from you\ntwo young men before I outstay my welcome.\"\n\n\"Don't hurry, Meyer,\" said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfsheim\nraised his hand in a sort of benediction.\n\n\"You're very polite but I belong to another generation,\" he announced\nsolemnly. \"You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and\nyour----\" He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his\nhand--\"As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won't impose myself\non you any longer.\"\n\nAs he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling.\nI wondered if I had said anything to offend him.\n\n\"He becomes very sentimental sometimes,\" explained Gatsby. \"This is one of\nhis sentimental days. He's quite a character around New York--a denizen of\nBroadway.\"\n\n\"Who is he anyhow--an actor?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"A dentist?\"\n\n\"Meyer Wolfsheim? No, he's a gambler.\" Gatsby hesitated, then added\ncoolly: \"He's the man who fixed the World's Series back in 1919.\"\n\n\"Fixed the World's Series?\" I repeated.\n\nThe idea staggered me. I remembered of course that the World's Series\nhad been fixed in 1919 but if I had thought of it at all I would have\nthought of it as a thing that merely HAPPENED, the end of some\ninevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could start to\nplay with the faith of fifty million people--with the single-mindedness\nof a burglar blowing a safe.\n\n\"How did he happen to do that?\" I asked after a minute.\n\n\"He just saw the opportunity.\"\n\n\"Why isn't he in jail?\"\n\n\"They can't get him, old sport. He's a smart man.\"\n\nI insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I caught\nsight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.\n\n\"Come along with me for a minute,\" I said. \"I've got to say hello\nto someone.\"\n\nWhen he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our\ndirection.\n\n\"Where've you been?\" he demanded eagerly. \"Daisy's furious because you\nhaven't called up.\"\n\n\"This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.\"\n\nThey shook hands briefly and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment\ncame over Gatsby's face.\n\n\"How've you been, anyhow?\" demanded Tom of me. \"How'd you happen to come\nup this far to eat?\"\n\n\"I've been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.\"\n\nI turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.\n\n\nOne October day in nineteen-seventeen----\n(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight\nchair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)\n--I was walking along from one place to another half on the sidewalks and\nhalf on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from\nEngland with rubber nobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground.\nI had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind and\nwhenever this happened the red, white and blue banners in front of all\nthe houses stretched out stiff and said TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT in a disapproving\nway.\n\nThe largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to\nDaisy Fay's house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and\nby far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She\ndressed in white, and had a little white roadster and all day long\nthe telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp\nTaylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night, \"anyways,\nfor an hour!\"\n\nWhen I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside\nthe curb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen\nbefore. They were so engrossed in each other that she didn't see me until\nI was five feet away.\n\n\"Hello Jordan,\" she called unexpectedly. \"Please come here.\"\n\nI was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older\ngirls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and\nmake bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn't come\nthat day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way\nthat every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it\nseemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since. His name\nwas Jay Gatsby and I didn't lay eyes on him again for over four\nyears--even after I'd met him on Long Island I didn't realize it was the\nsame man.\n\nThat was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux myself,\nand I began to play in tournaments, so I didn't see Daisy very often.\nShe went with a slightly older crowd--when she went with anyone at all.\nWild rumors were circulating about her--how her mother had found her\npacking her bag one winter night to go to New York and say goodbye to a\nsoldier who was going overseas. She was effectually prevented, but she\nwasn't on speaking terms with her family for several weeks. After\nthat she didn't play around with the soldiers any more but only\nwith a few flat-footed, short-sighted young men in town who couldn't\nget into the army at all.\n\nBy the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a debut\nafter the Armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a\nman from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago with\nmore pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He came\ndown with a hundred people in four private cars and hired a whole\nfloor of the Seelbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave her\na string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\n\nI was bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the bridal\ndinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in\nher flowered dress--and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle of\nsauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.\n\n\" 'Gratulate me,\" she muttered. \"Never had a drink before but oh, how I do\nenjoy it.\"\n\n\"What's the matter, Daisy?\"\n\nI was scared, I can tell you; I'd never seen a girl like that before.\n\n\"Here, dearis.\" She groped around in a waste-basket she had with her\non the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. \"Take 'em downstairs and\ngive 'em back to whoever they belong to. Tell 'em all Daisy's change' her\nmine. Say 'Daisy's change' her mine!'.\"\n\nShe began to cry--she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her\nmother's maid and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath. She\nwouldn't let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her and\nsqueezed it up into a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the\nsoap dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.\n\nBut she didn't say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and put\nice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress and half an\nhour later when we walked out of the room the pearls were around her\nneck and the incident was over. Next day at five o'clock she married Tom\nBuchanan without so much as a shiver and started off on a three months'\ntrip to the South Seas.\n\nI saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back and I thought I'd\nnever seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he left the room for a\nminute she'd look around uneasily and say \"Where's Tom gone?\" and\nwear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the\ndoor. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour\nrubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable\ndelight. It was touching to see them together--it made you laugh in a\nhushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I left Santa\nBarbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night and ripped\na front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got into the\npapers too because her arm was broken--she was one of the chambermaids\nin the Santa Barbara Hotel.\n\nThe next April Daisy had her little girl and they went to France for a\nyear. I saw them one spring in Cannes and later in Deauville and then\nthey came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in Chicago,\nas you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich\nand wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation.\nPerhaps because she doesn't drink. It's a great advantage not to drink\namong hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and, moreover,\nyou can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else\nis so blind that they don't see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in\nfor amour at all--and yet there's something in that voice of hers. . . .\n\nWell, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time\nin years. It was when I asked you--do you remember?--if you knew Gatsby\nin West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me\nup, and said \"What Gatsby?\" and when I described him--I was half\nasleep--she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used\nto know. It wasn't until then that I connected this Gatsby with the\nofficer in her white car.\n\n\nWhen Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza\nfor half an hour and were driving in a Victoria through Central Park.\nThe sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in\nthe West Fifties and the clear voices of girls, already gathered like\ncrickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:\n\n\n    \"I'm the Sheik of Araby,\n    Your love belongs to me.\n    At night when you're asleep,\n    Into your tent I'll creep----\"\n\n\n\"It was a strange coincidence,\" I said.\n\n\"But it wasn't a coincidence at all.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.\"\n\nThen it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired\non that June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the\nwomb of his purposeless splendor.\n\n\"He wants to know--\" continued Jordan \"--if you'll invite Daisy to your\nhouse some afternoon and then let him come over.\"\n\nThe modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and bought a\nmansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths so that he could\n\"come over\" some afternoon to a stranger's garden.\n\n\"Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?\"\n\n\"He's afraid. He's waited so long. He thought you might be offended.\nYou see he's a regular tough underneath it all.\"\n\nSomething worried me.\n\n\"Why didn't he ask you to arrange a meeting?\"\n\n\"He wants her to see his house,\" she explained. \"And your house is right\nnext door.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties,\nsome night,\" went on Jordan, \"but she never did. Then he began asking\npeople casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found.\nIt was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have\nheard the elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately\nsuggested a luncheon in New York--and I thought he'd go mad:\n\n\" 'I don't want to do anything out of the way!' he kept saying. 'I want to\nsee her right next door.'\n\n\"When I said you were a particular friend of Tom's he started to abandon\nthe whole idea. He doesn't know very much about Tom, though he says he's\nread a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse\nof Daisy's name.\"\n\nIt was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm\naround Jordan's golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to\ndinner. Suddenly I wasn't thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more but of\nthis clean, hard, limited person who dealt in universal skepticism and\nwho leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm. A phrase began\nto beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: \"There are only the\npursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.\"\n\n\"And Daisy ought to have something in her life,\" murmured Jordan to me.\n\n\"Does she want to see Gatsby?\"\n\n\"She's not to know about it. Gatsby doesn't want her to know. You're\njust supposed to invite her to tea.\"\n\nWe passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the facade of Fifty-ninth\nStreet, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park.\nUnlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan I had no girl whose disembodied face\nfloated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so I drew up the\ngirl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth smiled and so\nI drew her up again, closer, this time to my face.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n\n\nWhen I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that\nmy house was on fire. Two o'clock and the whole corner of the peninsula\nwas blazing with light which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin\nelongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a corner I saw that it\nwas Gatsby's house, lit from tower to cellar.\n\nAt first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved\nitself into \"hide-and-go-seek\" or \"sardines-in-the-box\" with all the\nhouse thrown open to the game. But there wasn't a sound. Only wind in\nthe trees which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again\nas if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned away I\nsaw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.\n\n\"Your place looks like the world's fair,\" I said.\n\n\"Does it?\" He turned his eyes toward it absently. \"I have been glancing\ninto some of the rooms. Let's go to Coney Island, old sport. In my car.\"\n\n\"It's too late.\"\n\n\"Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven't made use\nof it all summer.\"\n\n\"I've got to go to bed.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nHe waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.\n\n\"I talked with Miss Baker,\" I said after a moment. \"I'm going to call up\nDaisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" he said carelessly. \"I don't want to put you to\nany trouble.\"\n\n\"What day would suit you?\"\n\n\"What day would suit YOU?\" he corrected me quickly. \"I don't want to put\nyou to any trouble, you see.\"\n\n\"How about the day after tomorrow?\" He considered for a moment. Then,\nwith reluctance:\n\n\"I want to get the grass cut,\" he said.\n\nWe both looked at the grass--there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn\nended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I suspected that\nhe meant my grass.\n\n\"There's another little thing,\" he said uncertainly, and hesitated.\n\n\"Would you rather put it off for a few days?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, it isn't about that. At least----\" He fumbled with a series of\nbeginnings. \"Why, I thought--why, look here, old sport, you don't make\nmuch money, do you?\"\n\n\"Not very much.\"\n\nThis seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.\n\n\"I thought you didn't, if you'll pardon my--you see, I carry on a\nlittle business on the side, a sort of sideline, you understand. And I\nthought that if you don't make very much--You're selling bonds, aren't\nyou, old sport?\"\n\n\"Trying to.\"\n\n\"Well, this would interest you. It wouldn't take up much of your\ntime and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be\na rather confidential sort of thing.\"\n\nI realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might\nhave been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer was\nobviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no choice\nexcept to cut him off there.\n\n\"I've got my hands full,\" I said. \"I'm much obliged but I couldn't take\non any more work.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't have to do any business with Wolfsheim.\" Evidently he\nthought that I was shying away from the \"gonnegtion\" mentioned at lunch,\nbut I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer, hoping I'd\nbegin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went\nunwillingly home.\n\nThe evening had made me light-headed and happy; I think I walked into a\ndeep sleep as I entered my front door. So I didn't know whether or not\nGatsby went to Coney Island or for how many hours he \"glanced into\nrooms\" while his house blazed gaudily on. I called up Daisy from the\noffice next morning and invited her to come to tea.\n\n\"Don't bring Tom,\" I warned her.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Don't bring Tom.\"\n\n\"Who is 'Tom'?\" she asked innocently.\n\nThe day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven o'clock a man in a\nraincoat dragging a lawn-mower tapped at my front door and said that\nMr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I\nhad forgotten to tell my Finn to come back so I drove into West Egg\nVillage to search for her among soggy white-washed alleys and to buy\nsome cups and lemons and flowers.\n\nThe flowers were unnecessary, for at two o'clock a greenhouse arrived\nfrom Gatsby's, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour\nlater the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel\nsuit, silver shirt and gold-colored tie hurried in. He was pale and\nthere were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.\n\n\"Is everything all right?\" he asked immediately.\n\n\"The grass looks fine, if that's what you mean.\"\n\n\"What grass?\" he inquired blankly. \"Oh, the grass in the yard.\" He looked\nout the window at it, but judging from his expression I don't believe\nhe saw a thing.\n\n\"Looks very good,\" he remarked vaguely. \"One of the papers said they\nthought the rain would stop about four. I think it was 'The Journal.' Have\nyou got everything you need in the shape of--of tea?\"\n\nI took him into the pantry where he looked a little reproachfully at the\nFinn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen\nshop.\n\n\"Will they do?\" I asked.\n\n\"Of course, of course! They're fine!\" and he added hollowly, \". . .old\nsport.\"\n\nThe rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist through which\noccasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes\nthrough a copy of Clay's \"Economics,\" starting at the Finnish tread that\nshook the kitchen floor and peering toward the bleared windows from time\nto time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking\nplace outside. Finally he got up and informed me in an uncertain voice\nthat he was going home.\n\n\"Why's that?\"\n\n\"Nobody's coming to tea. It's too late!\" He looked at his watch as if\nthere was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. \"I can't wait\nall day.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly; it's just two minutes to four.\"\n\nHe sat down, miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously there\nwas the sound of a motor turning into my lane. We both jumped up and,\na little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.\n\nUnder the dripping bare lilac trees a large open car was coming up the\ndrive. It stopped. Daisy's face, tipped sideways beneath a\nthree-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic\nsmile.\n\n\"Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?\"\n\nThe exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had\nto follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone\nbefore any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of\nblue paint across her cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as\nI took it to help her from the car.\n\n\"Are you in love with me,\" she said low in my ear. \"Or why did I have\nto come alone?\"\n\n\"That's the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far\naway and spend an hour.\"\n\n\"Come back in an hour, Ferdie.\" Then in a grave murmur, \"His name is\nFerdie.\"\n\n\"Does the gasoline affect his nose?\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" she said innocently. \"Why?\"\n\nWe went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living room was deserted.\n\n\"Well, that's funny!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"What's funny?\"\n\nShe turned her head as there was a light, dignified knocking at the front\ndoor. I went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands\nplunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of\nwater glaring tragically into my eyes.\n\nWith his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the\nhall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire and disappeared into the\nliving room. It wasn't a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of my own\nheart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.\n\nFor half a minute there wasn't a sound. Then from the living room I\nheard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh followed by Daisy's\nvoice on a clear artificial note.\n\n\"I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.\"\n\nA pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall so I went\ninto the room.\n\nGatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the\nmantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom.\nHis head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a\ndefunct mantelpiece clock and from this position his distraught eyes\nstared down at Daisy who was sitting frightened but graceful on the\nedge of a stiff chair.\n\n\"We've met before,\" muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily at\nme and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily\nthe clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his\nhead, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers and set\nit back in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the\nsofa and his chin in his hand.\n\n\"I'm sorry about the clock,\" he said.\n\nMy own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldn't muster up\na single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.\n\n\"It's an old clock,\" I told them idiotically.\n\nI think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on\nthe floor.\n\n\"We haven't met for many years,\" said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact\nas it could ever be.\n\n\"Five years next November.\"\n\nThe automatic quality of Gatsby's answer set us all back at least another\nminute. I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that\nthey help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in\non a tray.\n\nAmid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency\nestablished itself. Gatsby got himself into a shadow and while Daisy\nand I talked looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with\ntense unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn't an end in itself I\nmade an excuse at the first possible moment and got to my feet.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.\n\n\"I'll be back.\"\n\n\"I've got to speak to you about something before you go.\"\n\nHe followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door and whispered:\n\"Oh, God!\" in a miserable way.\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"This is a terrible mistake,\" he said, shaking his head from side to\nside, \"a terrible, terrible mistake.\"\n\n\"You're just embarrassed, that's all,\" and luckily I added: \"Daisy's\nembarrassed too.\"\n\n\"She's embarrassed?\" he repeated incredulously.\n\n\"Just as much as you are.\"\n\n\"Don't talk so loud.\"\n\n\"You're acting like a little boy,\" I broke out impatiently. \"Not only\nthat but you're rude. Daisy's sitting in there all alone.\"\n\n\nHe raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable\nreproach and opening the door cautiously went back into the other room.\n\nI walked out the back way--just as Gatsby had when he had made his\nnervous circuit of the house half an hour before--and ran for a huge\nblack knotted tree whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain.\nOnce more it was pouring and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by\nGatsby's gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric\nmarshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree except\nGatsby's enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church\nsteeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the \"period\"\ncraze, a decade before, and there was a story that he'd agreed to pay\nfive years' taxes on all the neighboring cottages if the owners would\nhave their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the\nheart out of his plan to Found a Family--he went into an immediate\ndecline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the\ndoor. Americans, while occasionally willing to be serfs, have always\nbeen obstinate about being peasantry.\n\nAfter half an hour the sun shone again and the grocer's automobile\nrounded Gatsby's drive with the raw material for his servants' dinner--I\nfelt sure he wouldn't eat a spoonful. A maid began opening the upper\nwindows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from a\nlarge central bay, spat meditatively into the garden. It was time I\nwent back. While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of\ntheir voices, rising and swelling a little, now and then, with gusts of\nemotion. But in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen within\nthe house too.\n\nI went in--after making every possible noise in the kitchen short of\npushing over the stove--but I don't believe they heard a sound. They\nwere sitting at either end of the couch looking at each other as if\nsome question had been asked or was in the air, and every vestige of\nembarrassment was gone. Daisy's face was smeared with tears and when I\ncame in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before\na mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding.\nHe literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new\nwell-being radiated from him and filled the little room.\n\n\"Oh, hello, old sport,\" he said, as if he hadn't seen me for years. I\nthought for a moment he was going to shake hands.\n\n\"It's stopped raining.\"\n\n\"Has it?\" When he realized what I was talking about, that there were\ntwinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man,\nlike an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to\nDaisy. \"What do you think of that? It's stopped raining.\"\n\n\"I'm glad, Jay.\" Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only\nof her unexpected joy.\n\n\"I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,\" he said, \"I'd like to\nshow her around.\"\n\n\"You're sure you want me to come?\"\n\n\"Absolutely, old sport.\"\n\nDaisy went upstairs to wash her face--too late I thought with humiliation\nof my towels--while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.\n\n\"My house looks well, doesn't it?\" he demanded. \"See how the whole\nfront of it catches the light.\"\n\nI agreed that it was splendid.\n\n\"Yes.\" His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. \"It took\nme just three years to earn the money that bought it.\"\n\n\"I thought you inherited your money.\"\n\n\"I did, old sport,\" he said automatically, \"but I lost most of it in\nthe big panic--the panic of the war.\"\n\nI think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what\nbusiness he was in he answered \"That's my affair,\" before he realized\nthat it wasn't the appropriate reply.\n\n\"Oh, I've been in several things,\" he corrected himself. \"I was in the\ndrug business and then I was in the oil business. But I'm not in either\none now.\" He looked at me with more attention. \"Do you mean you've been\nthinking over what I proposed the other night?\"\n\nBefore I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass\nbuttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.\n\n\"That huge place THERE?\" she cried pointing.\n\n\"Do you like it?\"\n\n\"I love it, but I don't see how you live there all alone.\"\n\n\"I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People who\ndo interesting things. Celebrated people.\"\n\nInstead of taking the short cut along the Sound we went down the road and\nentered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this\naspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the\ngardens, the sparkling odor of jonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn\nand plum blossoms and the pale gold odor of kiss-me-at-the-gate.\nIt was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright\ndresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the\ntrees.\n\nAnd inside as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music rooms and\nRestoration salons I felt that there were guests concealed behind\nevery couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we\nhad passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of \"the Merton College\nLibrary\" I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into\nghostly laughter.\n\nWe went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender\nsilk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing rooms and poolrooms,\nand bathrooms with sunken baths--intruding into one chamber where a\ndishevelled man in pajamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It\nwas Mr. Klipspringer, the \"boarder.\" I had seen him wandering hungrily\nabout the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby's own apartment,\na bedroom and a bath and an Adam study, where we sat down and drank a\nglass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall.\n\nHe hadn't once ceased looking at Daisy and I think he revalued\neverything in his house according to the measure of response it drew\nfrom her well-loved eyes. Sometimes, too, he stared around at his\npossessions in a dazed way as though in her actual and astounding\npresence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a\nflight of stairs.\n\nHis bedroom was the simplest room of all--except where the dresser was\ngarnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush\nwith delight and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and\nshaded his eyes and began to laugh.\n\n\"It's the funniest thing, old sport,\" he said hilariously. \"I can't--when\nI try to----\"\n\nHe had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third.\nAfter his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with\nwonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed it\nright through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak, at an\ninconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction, he was running\ndown like an overwound clock.\n\nRecovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent\ncabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and\nhis shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.\n\n\"I've got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection\nof things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.\"\n\nHe took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one\nbefore us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel\nwhich lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in\nmany-colored disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft\nrich heap mounted higher--shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in\ncoral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange with monograms of\nIndian blue. Suddenly with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into\nthe shirts and began to cry stormily.\n\n\"They're such beautiful shirts,\" she sobbed, her voice muffled in the\nthick folds. \"It makes me sad because I've never seen such--such beautiful\nshirts before.\"\n\n\nAfter the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and the\nhydroplane and the midsummer flowers--but outside Gatsby's window it\nbegan to rain again so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated\nsurface of the Sound.\n\n\"If it wasn't for the mist we could see your home across the bay,\" said\nGatsby. \"You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of\nyour dock.\"\n\nDaisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed\nin what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the\ncolossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared\nto the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed\nvery near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star\nto the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of\nenchanted objects had diminished by one.\n\nI began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in\nthe half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting\ncostume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.\n\n\"Who's this?\"\n\n\"That? That's Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.\"\n\nThe name sounded faintly familiar.\n\n\"He's dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.\"\n\nThere was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the\nbureau--Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly--taken apparently\nwhen he was about eighteen.\n\n\"I adore it!\" exclaimed Daisy. \"The pompadour! You never told me you had\na pompadour--or a yacht.\"\n\n\"Look at this,\" said Gatsby quickly. \"Here's a lot of clippings--about\nyou.\"\n\nThey stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the rubies\nwhen the phone rang and Gatsby took up the receiver.\n\n\"Yes. . . . Well, I can't talk now. . . . I can't talk now, old\nsport. . . . I said a SMALL town. . . . He must know what a small town\nis. . . . Well, he's no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small\ntown. . . .\"\n\nHe rang off.\n\n\"Come here QUICK!\" cried Daisy at the window.\n\nThe rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west,\nand there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.\n\n\"Look at that,\" she whispered, and then after a moment: \"I'd like to\njust get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you\naround.\"\n\nI tried to go then, but they wouldn't hear of it; perhaps my presence\nmade them feel more satisfactorily alone.\n\n\"I know what we'll do,\" said Gatsby, \"we'll have Klipspringer play the\npiano.\"\n\nHe went out of the room calling \"Ewing!\" and returned in a few\nminutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man with\nshell-rimmed glasses and scanty blonde hair. He was now decently clothed\nin a \"sport shirt\" open at the neck, sneakers and duck trousers of a\nnebulous hue.\n\n\"Did we interrupt your exercises?\" inquired Daisy politely.\n\n\"I was asleep,\" cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment.\n\"That is, I'd BEEN asleep. Then I got up. . . .\"\n\n\"Klipspringer plays the piano,\" said Gatsby, cutting him off. \"Don't you,\nEwing, old sport?\"\n\n\"I don't play well. I don't--I hardly play at all. I'm all out of\nprac----\"\n\n\"We'll go downstairs,\" interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The\ngrey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.\n\nIn the music room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano. He\nlit Daisy's cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on\na couch far across the room where there was no light save what the\ngleaming floor bounced in from the hall.\n\nWhen Klipspringer had played \"The Love Nest\" he turned around on the\nbench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.\n\n\"I'm all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn't play. I'm all\nout of prac----\"\n\n\"Don't talk so much, old sport,\" commanded Gatsby. \"Play!\"\n\n\n    IN THE MORNING,\n    IN THE EVENING,\n       AIN'T WE GOT FUN----\n\nOutside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the\nSound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains,\nmen-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York. It was\nthe hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating on\nthe air.\n\n\n    ONE THING'S SURE AND NOTHING'S SURER\n    THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET--CHILDREN.\n       IN THE MEANTIME,\n       IN BETWEEN TIME----\n\n\nAs I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of bewilderment\nhad come back into Gatsby's face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to\nhim as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost five\nyears! There must have been moments even that afternoon when\nDaisy tumbled short of his dreams--not through her own fault but\nbecause of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond\nher, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative\npassion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright\nfeather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can\nchallenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.\n\nAs I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took\nhold of hers and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward\nher with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most with its\nfluctuating, feverish warmth because it couldn't be over-dreamed--that\nvoice was a deathless song.\n\nThey had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand;\nGatsby didn't know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they\nlooked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I went out\nof the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there\ntogether.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n\n\nAbout this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one\nmorning at Gatsby's door and asked him if he had anything to say.\n\n\"Anything to say about what?\" inquired Gatsby politely.\n\n\"Why,--any statement to give out.\"\n\nIt transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard\nGatsby's name around his office in a connection which he either\nwouldn't reveal or didn't fully understand. This was his day off\nand with laudable initiative he had hurried out \"to see.\"\n\nIt was a random shot, and yet the reporter's instinct was right. Gatsby's\nnotoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his\nhospitality and so become authorities on his past, had increased\nall summer until he fell just short of being news. Contemporary\nlegends such as the \"underground pipe-line to Canada\" attached\nthemselves to him, and there was one persistent story that he\ndidn't live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house\nand was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore. Just why\nthese inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North\nDakota, isn't easy to say.\n\nJames Gatz--that was really, or at least legally, his name. He had\nchanged it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that\nwitnessed the beginning of his career--when he saw Dan Cody's yacht drop\nanchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior. It was James Gatz\nwho had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green\njersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby who\nborrowed a row-boat, pulled out to the TUOLOMEE and informed Cody that\na wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour.\n\nI suppose he'd had the name ready for a long time, even then. His\nparents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people--his imagination had\nnever really accepted them as his parents at all. The truth was that\nJay Gatsby, of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic\nconception of himself. He was a son of God--a phrase which, if it means\nanything, means just that--and he must be about His Father's Business,\nthe service of a vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty. So he invented\njust the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be\nlikely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.\n\nFor over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of\nLake Superior as a clam digger and a salmon fisher or in any other\ncapacity that brought him food and bed. His brown, hardening body lived\nnaturally through the half fierce, half lazy work of the bracing days.\nHe knew women early and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous\nof them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of the others\nbecause they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming\nself-absorption he took for granted.\n\nBut his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque\nand fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe\nof ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the\nclock ticked on the wash-stand and the moon soaked with wet\nlight his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the\npattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid\nscene with an oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an\noutlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the\nunreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded\nsecurely on a fairy's wing.\n\nAn instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to\nthe small Lutheran college of St. Olaf in southern Minnesota. He stayed\nthere two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of\nhis destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor's work with\nwhich he was to pay his way through. Then he drifted back to Lake\nSuperior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day\nthat Dan Cody's yacht dropped anchor in the shallows along shore.\n\nCody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields,\nof the Yukon, of every rush for metal since Seventy-five. The\ntransactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire\nfound him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and,\nsuspecting this an infinite number of women tried to separate him from\nhis money. The none too savory ramifications by which Ella Kaye, the\nnewspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him\nto sea in a yacht, were common knowledge to the turgid journalism\nof 1902. He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five\nyears when he turned up as James Gatz's destiny at Little Girl Bay.\n\nTo the young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed\ndeck, the yacht represented all the beauty and glamor in the world. I\nsuppose he smiled at Cody--he had probably discovered that people liked\nhim when he smiled. At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of\nthem elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick, and\nextravagantly ambitious. A few days later he took him to Duluth and\nbought him a blue coat, six pair of white duck trousers and a yachting\ncap. And when the TUOLOMEE left for the West Indies and the Barbary\nCoast Gatsby left too.\n\nHe was employed in a vague personal capacity--while he remained with\nCody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor,\nfor Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be\nabout and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more\ntrust in Gatsby. The arrangement lasted five years during which the\nboat went three times around the continent. It might have lasted\nindefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night\nin Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died.\n\nI remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby's bedroom, a grey, florid\nman with a hard empty face--the pioneer debauchee who during one phase\nof American life brought back to the eastern seaboard the savage\nviolence of the frontier brothel and saloon. It was indirectly due to\nCody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gay parties\nwomen used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the\nhabit of letting liquor alone.\n\nAnd it was from Cody that he inherited money--a legacy of twenty-five\nthousand dollars. He didn't get it. He never understood the legal\ndevice that was used against him but what remained of the millions\nwent intact to Ella Kaye. He was left with his singularly appropriate\neducation; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the\nsubstantiality of a man.\n\n\nHe told me all this very much later, but I've put it down here with the\nidea of exploding those first wild rumors about his antecedents, which\nweren't even faintly true. Moreover he told it to me at a time of\nconfusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and\nnothing about him. So I take advantage of this short halt, while\nGatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of\nmisconceptions away.\n\nIt was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. For\nseveral weeks I didn't see him or hear his voice on the phone--mostly\nI was in New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to\ningratiate myself with her senile aunt--but finally I went over to\nhis house one Sunday afternoon. I hadn't been there two minutes when\nsomebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink. I was startled,\nnaturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadn't happened\nbefore.\n\nThey were a party of three on horseback--Tom and a man named Sloane and\na pretty woman in a brown riding habit who had been there previously.\n\n\"I'm delighted to see you,\" said Gatsby standing on his porch.\n\"I'm delighted that you dropped in.\"\n\nAs though they cared!\n\n\"Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.\" He walked around the room\nquickly, ringing bells. \"I'll have something to drink for you in just\na minute.\"\n\nHe was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But he would be\nuneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in a vague\nway that that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted nothing. A\nlemonade? No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at all,\nthanks. . . . I'm sorry----\n\n\"Did you have a nice ride?\"\n\n\"Very good roads around here.\"\n\n\"I suppose the automobiles----\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nMoved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom who had accepted\nthe introduction as a stranger.\n\n\"I believe we've met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Tom, gruffly polite but obviously not remembering.\n\"So we did. I remember very well.\"\n\n\"About two weeks ago.\"\n\n\"That's right. You were with Nick here.\"\n\n\"I know your wife,\" continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.\n\n\"That so?\"\n\nTom turned to me.\n\n\"You live near here, Nick?\"\n\n\"Next door.\"\n\n\"That so?\"\n\nMr. Sloane didn't enter into the conversation but lounged back haughtily\nin his chair; the woman said nothing either--until unexpectedly, after\ntwo highballs, she became cordial.\n\n\"We'll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,\" she suggested.\n\"What do you say?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I'd be delighted to have you.\"\n\n\"Be ver' nice,\" said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. \"Well--think ought to\nbe starting home.\"\n\n\"Please don't hurry,\" Gatsby urged them. He had control of himself now\nand he wanted to see more of Tom. \"Why don't you--why don't you stay for\nsupper? I wouldn't be surprised if some other people dropped in from\nNew York.\"\n\n\"You come to supper with ME,\" said the lady enthusiastically.\n\"Both of you.\"\n\nThis included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.\n\n\"Come along,\" he said--but to her only.\n\n\"I mean it,\" she insisted. \"I'd love to have you. Lots of room.\"\n\nGatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn't see\nthat Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn't.\n\n\"I'm afraid I won't be able to,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you come,\" she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.\n\nMr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.\n\n\"We won't be late if we start now,\" she insisted aloud.\n\n\"I haven't got a horse,\" said Gatsby. \"I used to ride in the army but\nI've never bought a horse. I'll have to follow you in my car. Excuse me\nfor just a minute.\"\n\nThe rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began\nan impassioned conversation aside.\n\n\"My God, I believe the man's coming,\" said Tom. \"Doesn't he know she\ndoesn't want him?\"\n\n\"She says she does want him.\"\n\n\"She has a big dinner party and he won't know a soul there.\" He frowned.\n\"I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be\nold-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to\nsuit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.\"\n\nSuddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted\ntheir horses.\n\n\"Come on,\" said Mr. Sloane to Tom, \"we're late. We've got to go.\" And then\nto me: \"Tell him we couldn't wait, will you?\"\n\nTom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod and\nthey trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August\nfoliage just as Gatsby with hat and light overcoat in hand came out\nthe front door.\n\nTom was evidently perturbed at Daisy's running around alone, for on the\nfollowing Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby's party. Perhaps\nhis presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness--it\nstands out in my memory from Gatsby's other parties that summer. There\nwere the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same\nprofusion of champagne, the same many-colored, many-keyed commotion,\nbut I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that\nhadn't been there before. Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it,\ngrown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own\nstandards and its own great figures, second to nothing because it had\nno consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at it again,\nthrough Daisy's eyes. It is invariably saddening to look through new\neyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of\nadjustment.\n\nThey arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among the sparkling\nhundreds Daisy's voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.\n\n\"These things excite me SO,\" she whispered. \"If you want to kiss me\nany time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I'll be glad\nto arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card.\nI'm giving out green----\"\n\n\"Look around,\" suggested Gatsby.\n\n\"I'm looking around. I'm having a marvelous----\"\n\n\"You must see the faces of many people you've heard about.\"\n\nTom's arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.\n\n\"We don't go around very much,\" he said. \"In fact I was just thinking\nI don't know a soul here.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you know that lady.\" Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely human\norchid of a woman who sat in state under a white plum tree. Tom and Daisy\nstared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the\nrecognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.\n\n\"She's lovely,\" said Daisy.\n\n\"The man bending over her is her director.\"\n\nHe took them ceremoniously from group to group:\n\n\"Mrs. Buchanan . . . and Mr. Buchanan----\" After an instant's hesitation\nhe added: \"the polo player.\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" objected Tom quickly, \"Not me.\"\n\nBut evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained \"the polo\nplayer\" for the rest of the evening.\n\n\"I've never met so many celebrities!\" Daisy exclaimed. \"I liked that\nman--what was his name?--with the sort of blue nose.\"\n\nGatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.\n\n\"Well, I liked him anyhow.\"\n\n\"I'd a little rather not be the polo player,\" said Tom pleasantly, \"I'd\nrather look at all these famous people in--in oblivion.\"\n\nDaisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful,\nconservative fox-trot--I had never seen him dance before. Then they\nsauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour while\nat her request I remained watchfully in the garden: \"In case there's a\nfire or a flood,\" she explained, \"or any act of God.\"\n\nTom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together.\n\"Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?\" he said. \"A fellow's\ngetting off some funny stuff.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" answered Daisy genially, \"And if you want to take down any\naddresses here's my little gold pencil. . . .\" She looked around after\na moment and told me the girl was \"common but pretty,\" and I knew that\nexcept for the half hour she'd been alone with Gatsby she wasn't having\na good time.\n\nWe were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault--Gatsby had\nbeen called to the phone and I'd enjoyed these same people only two\nweeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now.\n\n\"How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?\"\n\nThe girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my\nshoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.\n\n\"Wha?\"\n\nA massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf\nwith her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker's defence:\n\n\"Oh, she's all right now. When she's had five or six cocktails she always\nstarts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it alone.\"\n\n\"I do leave it alone,\" affirmed the accused hollowly.\n\n\"We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: 'There's somebody\nthat needs your help, Doc.' \"\n\n\"She's much obliged, I'm sure,\" said another friend, without gratitude.\n\"But you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool.\"\n\n\"Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,\" mumbled Miss\nBaedeker. \"They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.\"\n\n\"Then you ought to leave it alone,\" countered Doctor Civet.\n\n\"Speak for yourself!\" cried Miss Baedeker violently. \"Your hand shakes.\nI wouldn't let you operate on me!\"\n\nIt was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with\nDaisy and watching the moving picture director and his Star. They were\nstill under the white plum tree and their faces were touching except\nfor a pale thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he\nhad been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this\nproximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate degree\nand kiss at her cheek.\n\n\"I like her,\" said Daisy, \"I think she's lovely.\"\n\nBut the rest offended her--and inarguably, because it wasn't a gesture but\nan emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented \"place\"\nthat Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village--appalled\nby its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too\nobtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short cut from nothing\nto nothing. She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed\nto understand.\n\nI sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car. It\nwas dark here in front: only the bright door sent ten square feet of\nlight volleying out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a shadow\nmoved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow,\nan indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an\ninvisible glass.\n\n\"Who is this Gatsby anyhow?\" demanded Tom suddenly. \"Some big bootlegger?\"\n\n\"Where'd you hear that?\" I inquired.\n\n\"I didn't hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are\njust big bootleggers, you know.\"\n\n\"Not Gatsby,\" I said shortly.\n\nHe was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under his\nfeet.\n\n\"Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie\ntogether.\"\n\nA breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy's fur collar.\n\n\"At least they're more interesting than the people we know,\" she said\nwith an effort.\n\n\"You didn't look so interested.\"\n\n\"Well, I was.\"\n\nTom laughed and turned to me.\n\n\"Did you notice Daisy's face when that girl asked her to put her under\na cold shower?\"\n\nDaisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper,\nbringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had\nbefore and would never have again. When the melody rose, her voice\nbroke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and\neach change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.\n\n\"Lots of people come who haven't been invited,\" she said suddenly.\n\"That girl hadn't been invited. They simply force their way in and he's\ntoo polite to object.\"\n\n\"I'd like to know who he is and what he does,\" insisted Tom. \"And I think\nI'll make a point of finding out.\"\n\n\"I can tell you right now,\" she answered. \"He owned some drug stores,\na lot of drug stores. He built them up himself.\"\n\nThe dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.\n\n\"Good night, Nick,\" said Daisy.\n\nHer glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps where\n\"Three o'Clock in the Morning,\" a neat, sad little waltz of that year,\nwas drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of\nGatsby's party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from\nher world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling\nher back inside? What would happen now in the dim incalculable hours?\nPerhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare\nand to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with\none fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would blot\nout those five years of unwavering devotion.\n\n\nI stayed late that night. Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free\nand I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run\nup, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights were\nextinguished in the guest rooms overhead. When he came down the steps at\nlast the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes\nwere bright and tired.\n\n\"She didn't like it,\" he said immediately.\n\n\"Of course she did.\"\n\n\"She didn't like it,\" he insisted. \"She didn't have a good time.\"\n\nHe was silent and I guessed at his unutterable depression.\n\n\"I feel far away from her,\" he said. \"It's hard to make her understand.\"\n\n\"You mean about the dance?\"\n\n\"The dance?\" He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of\nhis fingers. \"Old sport, the dance is unimportant.\"\n\nHe wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say:\n\"I never loved you.\" After she had obliterated three years with that\nsentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken.\nOne of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back to\nLouisville and be married from her house--just as if it were five\nyears ago.\n\n\"And she doesn't understand,\" he said. \"She used to be able to\nunderstand. We'd sit for hours----\"\n\nHe broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds\nand discarded favors and crushed flowers.\n\n\"I wouldn't ask too much of her,\" I ventured. \"You can't repeat the past.\"\n\n\"Can't repeat the past?\" he cried incredulously. \"Why of course you can!\"\n\nHe looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the\nshadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.\n\n\"I'm going to fix everything just the way it was before,\" he said,\nnodding determinedly. \"She'll see.\"\n\nHe talked a lot about the past and I gathered that he wanted to recover\nsomething, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy.\nHis life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could\nonce return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he\ncould find out what that thing was. . . .\n\n. . . One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down\nthe street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where\nthere were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight.\nThey stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night\nwith that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of\nthe year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the\ndarkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the\ncorner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalk really\nformed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees--he could\nclimb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the\npap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.\n\nHis heart beat faster and faster as Daisy's white face came up to his\nown. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his\nunutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp\nagain like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer\nto the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed\nher. At his lips' touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the\nincarnation was complete.\n\nThrough all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was\nreminded of something--an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that\nI had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to\ntake shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man's, as though\nthere was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But\nthey made no sound and what I had almost remembered was\nuncommunicable forever.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\n\n\nIt was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights\nin his house failed to go on one Saturday night--and, as obscurely as it\nhad begun, his career as Trimalchio was over.\n\nOnly gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned\nexpectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove\nsulkily away. Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out--an\nunfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously\nfrom the door.\n\n\"Is Mr. Gatsby sick?\"\n\n\"Nope.\" After a pause he added \"sir\" in a dilatory, grudging way.\n\n\"I hadn't seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr. Carraway\ncame over.\"\n\n\"Who?\" he demanded rudely.\n\n\"Carraway.\"\n\n\"Carraway. All right, I'll tell him.\" Abruptly he slammed the door.\n\nMy Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his\nhouse a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never\nwent into West Egg Village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered\nmoderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that the\nkitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village was\nthat the new people weren't servants at all.\n\nNext day Gatsby called me on the phone.\n\n\"Going away?\" I inquired.\n\n\"No, old sport.\"\n\n\"I hear you fired all your servants.\"\n\n\"I wanted somebody who wouldn't gossip. Daisy comes over quite often--in\nthe afternoons.\"\n\nSo the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the\ndisapproval in her eyes.\n\n\"They're some people Wolfsheim wanted to do something for. They're all\nbrothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nHe was calling up at Daisy's request--would I come to lunch at\nher house tomorrow? Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later\nDaisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was coming.\nSomething was up. And yet I couldn't believe that they would choose\nthis occasion for a scene--especially for the rather harrowing scene\nthat Gatsby had outlined in the garden.\n\nThe next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of\nthe summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the\nhot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush\nat noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion;\nthe woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white\nshirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers,\nlapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry. Her pocket-book\nslapped to the floor.\n\n\"Oh, my!\" she gasped.\n\nI picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it\nat arm's length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that\nI had no designs upon it--but every one near by, including the woman,\nsuspected me just the same.\n\n\"Hot!\" said the conductor to familiar faces. \"Some weather! Hot! Hot! Hot!\nIs it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it . . . ?\"\n\nMy commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand.\nThat any one should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed,\nwhose head made damp the pajama pocket over his heart!\n\n. . . Through the hall of the Buchanans' house blew a faint wind,\ncarrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we\nwaited at the door.\n\n\"The master's body!\" roared the butler into the mouthpiece. \"I'm sorry,\nmadame, but we can't furnish it--it's far too hot to touch this noon!\"\n\nWhat he really said was: \"Yes . . . yes . . . I'll see.\"\n\nHe set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to take\nour stiff straw hats.\n\n\"Madame expects you in the salon!\" he cried, needlessly indicating the\ndirection. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the\ncommon store of life.\n\nThe room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and\nJordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols, weighing down\ntheir own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.\n\n\"We can't move,\" they said together.\n\nJordan's fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in\nmine.\n\n\"And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?\" I inquired.\n\nSimultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall\ntelephone.\n\nGatsby stood in the center of the crimson carpet and gazed around with\nfascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting\nlaugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.\n\n\"The rumor is,\" whispered Jordan, \"that that's Tom's girl on the\ntelephone.\"\n\nWe were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance.\n\"Very well, then, I won't sell you the car at all. . . . I'm\nunder no obligations to you at all. . . . And as for your bothering me\nabout it at lunch time I won't stand that at all!\"\n\n\"Holding down the receiver,\" said Daisy cynically.\n\n\"No, he's not,\" I assured her. \"It's a bona fide deal. I happen to\nknow about it.\"\n\nTom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his\nthick body, and hurried into the room.\n\n\"Mr. Gatsby!\" He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed\ndislike. \"I'm glad to see you, sir. . . . Nick. . . .\"\n\n\"Make us a cold drink,\" cried Daisy.\n\nAs he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled\nhis face down kissing him on the mouth.\n\n\"You know I love you,\" she murmured.\n\n\"You forget there's a lady present,\" said Jordan.\n\nDaisy looked around doubtfully.\n\n\"You kiss Nick too.\"\n\n\"What a low, vulgar girl!\"\n\n\"I don't care!\" cried Daisy and began to clog on the brick fireplace.\nThen she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as\na freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.\n\n\"Bles-sed pre-cious,\" she crooned, holding out her arms. \"Come to your\nown mother that loves you.\"\n\nThe child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and rooted\nshyly into her mother's dress.\n\n\"The Bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy\nhair? Stand up now, and say How-de-do.\"\n\nGatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand.\nAfterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don't think he had\never really believed in its existence before.\n\n\"I got dressed before luncheon,\" said the child, turning eagerly to\nDaisy.\n\n\"That's because your mother wanted to show you off.\" Her face bent into\nthe single wrinkle of the small white neck. \"You dream, you. You absolute\nlittle dream.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" admitted the child calmly. \"Aunt Jordan's got on a white\ndress too.\"\n\n\"How do you like mother's friends?\" Daisy turned her around so that she\nfaced Gatsby. \"Do you think they're pretty?\"\n\n\"Where's Daddy?\"\n\n\"She doesn't look like her father,\" explained Daisy. \"She looks like me.\nShe's got my hair and shape of the face.\"\n\nDaisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held\nout her hand.\n\n\"Come, Pammy.\"\n\n\"Goodbye, sweetheart!\"\n\nWith a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her\nnurse's hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back,\npreceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.\n\nGatsby took up his drink.\n\n\"They certainly look cool,\" he said, with visible tension.\n\nWe drank in long greedy swallows.\n\n\"I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter every year,\" said Tom\ngenially. \"It seems that pretty soon the earth's going to fall into the\nsun--or wait a minute--it's just the opposite--the sun's getting colder\nevery year.\n\n\"Come outside,\" he suggested to Gatsby, \"I'd like you to have a look at\nthe place.\"\n\nI went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in the\nheat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea. Gatsby's eyes\nfollowed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay.\n\n\"I'm right across from you.\"\n\n\"So you are.\"\n\nOur eyes lifted over the rosebeds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse\nof the dog days along shore. Slowly the white wings of the boat moved\nagainst the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and\nthe abounding blessed isles.\n\n\"There's sport for you,\" said Tom, nodding. \"I'd like to be out there\nwith him for about an hour.\"\n\nWe had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened, too, against the heat,\nand drank down nervous gayety with the cold ale.\n\n\"What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon,\" cried Daisy, \"and the\nday after that, and the next thirty years?\"\n\n\"Don't be morbid,\" Jordan said. \"Life starts all over again when it gets\ncrisp in the fall.\"\n\n\"But it's so hot,\" insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, \"And\neverything's so confused. Let's all go to town!\"\n\nHer voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding its\nsenselessness into forms.\n\n\"I've heard of making a garage out of a stable,\" Tom was saying to\nGatsby, \"but I'm the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.\"\n\n\"Who wants to go to town?\" demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby's eyes\nfloated toward her. \"Ah,\" she cried, \"you look so cool.\"\n\nTheir eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space.\nWith an effort she glanced down at the table.\n\n\"You always look so cool,\" she repeated.\n\nShe had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was\nastounded. His mouth opened a little and he looked at Gatsby and then\nback at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as some one he knew a\nlong time ago.\n\n\"You resemble the advertisement of the man,\" she went on innocently.\n\"You know the advertisement of the man----\"\n\n\"All right,\" broke in Tom quickly, \"I'm perfectly willing to go to\ntown. Come on--we're all going to town.\"\n\nHe got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife.\nNo one moved.\n\n\"Come on!\" His temper cracked a little. \"What's the matter, anyhow?\nIf we're going to town let's start.\"\n\nHis hand, trembling with his effort at self control, bore to his lips the\nlast of his glass of ale. Daisy's voice got us to our feet and out on\nto the blazing gravel drive.\n\n\"Are we just going to go?\" she objected. \"Like this? Aren't we going to\nlet any one smoke a cigarette first?\"\n\n\"Everybody smoked all through lunch.\"\n\n\"Oh, let's have fun,\" she begged him. \"It's too hot to fuss.\"\n\nHe didn't answer.\n\n\"Have it your own way,\" she said. \"Come on, Jordan.\"\n\nThey went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling\nthe hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon hovered already\nin the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not\nbefore Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.\n\n\"Have you got your stables here?\" asked Gatsby with an effort.\n\n\"About a quarter of a mile down the road.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"I don't see the idea of going to town,\" broke out Tom savagely.\n\"Women get these notions in their heads----\"\n\n\"Shall we take anything to drink?\" called Daisy from an upper window.\n\n\"I'll get some whiskey,\" answered Tom. He went inside.\n\nGatsby turned to me rigidly:\n\n\"I can't say anything in his house, old sport.\"\n\n\"She's got an indiscreet voice,\" I remarked. \"It's full of----\"\n\nI hesitated.\n\n\"Her voice is full of money,\" he said suddenly.\n\nThat was it. I'd never understood before. It was full of money--that was\nthe inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the\ncymbals' song of it. . . . High in a white palace the king's daughter,\nthe golden girl. . . .\n\nTom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed\nby Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and\ncarrying light capes over their arms.\n\n\"Shall we all go in my car?\" suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green\nleather of the seat. \"I ought to have left it in the shade.\"\n\n\"Is it standard shift?\" demanded Tom.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, you take my coup\u00e9 and let me drive your car to town.\"\n\nThe suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.\n\n\"I don't think there's much gas,\" he objected.\n\n\"Plenty of gas,\" said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge.\n\"And if it runs out I can stop at a drug store. You can buy anything at a\ndrug store nowadays.\"\n\nA pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom\nfrowning and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar\nand vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in words,\npassed over Gatsby's face.\n\n\"Come on, Daisy,\" said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby's\ncar. \"I'll take you in this circus wagon.\"\n\nHe opened the door but she moved out from the circle of his arm.\n\n\"You take Nick and Jordan. We'll follow you in the coup\u00e9.\"\n\nShe walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan and\nTom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby's car, Tom pushed the\nunfamiliar gears tentatively and we shot off into the oppressive heat\nleaving them out of sight behind.\n\n\"Did you see that?\" demanded Tom.\n\n\"See what?\"\n\nHe looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known all\nalong.\n\n\"You think I'm pretty dumb, don't you?\" he suggested. \"Perhaps I am, but\nI have a--almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do.\nMaybe you don't believe that, but science----\"\n\nHe paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back from\nthe edge of the theoretical abyss.\n\n\"I've made a small investigation of this fellow,\" he continued. \"I could\nhave gone deeper if I'd known----\"\n\n\"Do you mean you've been to a medium?\" inquired Jordan humorously.\n\n\"What?\" Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. \"A medium?\"\n\n\"About Gatsby.\"\n\n\"About Gatsby! No, I haven't. I said I'd been making a small\ninvestigation of his past.\"\n\n\"And you found he was an Oxford man,\" said Jordan helpfully.\n\n\"An Oxford man!\" He was incredulous. \"Like hell he is! He wears a\npink suit.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless he's an Oxford man.\"\n\n\"Oxford, New Mexico,\" snorted Tom contemptuously, \"or something like\nthat.\"\n\n\"Listen, Tom. If you're such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?\"\ndemanded Jordan crossly.\n\n\"Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married--God knows\nwhere!\"\n\nWe were all irritable now with the fading ale and, aware of it,\nwe drove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg's faded\neyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby's caution about\ngasoline.\n\n\"We've got enough to get us to town,\" said Tom.\n\n\"But there's a garage right here,\" objected Jordan. \"I don't want to get\nstalled in this baking heat.\"\n\nTom threw on both brakes impatiently and we slid to an abrupt\ndusty stop under Wilson's sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged\nfrom the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.\n\n\"Let's have some gas!\" cried Tom roughly. \"What do you think we stopped\nfor--to admire the view?\"\n\n\"I'm sick,\" said Wilson without moving. \"I been sick all day.\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"I'm all run down.\"\n\n\"Well, shall I help myself?\" Tom demanded. \"You sounded well enough\non the phone.\"\n\nWith an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and,\nbreathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his face\nwas green.\n\n\"I didn't mean to interrupt your lunch,\" he said. \"But I need money\npretty bad and I was wondering what you were going to do with your\nold car.\"\n\n\"How do you like this one?\" inquired Tom. \"I bought it last week.\"\n\n\"It's a nice yellow one,\" said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.\n\n\"Like to buy it?\"\n\n\"Big chance,\" Wilson smiled faintly. \"No, but I could make some money\non the other.\"\n\n\"What do you want money for, all of a sudden?\"\n\n\"I've been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to\ngo west.\"\n\n\"Your wife does!\" exclaimed Tom, startled.\n\n\"She's been talking about it for ten years.\" He rested for a moment\nagainst the pump, shading his eyes. \"And now she's going whether she wants\nto or not. I'm going to get her away.\"\n\nThe coup\u00e9 flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a\nwaving hand.\n\n\"What do I owe you?\" demanded Tom harshly.\n\n\"I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,\" remarked\nWilson. \"That's why I want to get away. That's why I been bothering you\nabout the car.\"\n\n\"What do I owe you?\"\n\n\"Dollar twenty.\"\n\nThe relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had\na bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions\nhadn't alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some\nsort of life apart from him in another world and the shock had\nmade him physically sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made\na parallel discovery less than an hour before--and it occurred to me\nthat there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so\nprofound as the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so\nsick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty--as if he had just got\nsome poor girl with child.\n\n\"I'll let you have that car,\" said Tom. \"I'll send it over tomorrow\nafternoon.\"\n\nThat locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad\nglare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been\nwarned of something behind. Over the ashheaps the giant eyes of\nDoctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil but I perceived, after\na moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity\nfrom less than twenty feet away.\n\nIn one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside\na little and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So engrossed\nwas she that she had no consciousness of being observed and one\nemotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly\ndeveloping picture. Her expression was curiously familiar--it was an\nexpression I had often seen on women's faces but on Myrtle Wilson's\nface it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her\neyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan\nBaker, whom she took to be his wife.\n\n\nThere is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we\ndrove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his\nmistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping\nprecipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the\naccelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving\nWilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour,\nuntil, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of\nthe easygoing blue coup\u00e9.\n\n\"Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,\" suggested Jordan.\n\"I love New York on summer afternoons when every one's away. There's\nsomething very sensuous about it--overripe, as if all sorts of funny\nfruits were going to fall into your hands.\"\n\nThe word \"sensuous\" had the effect of further disquieting Tom but before\nhe could invent a protest the coup\u00e9 came to a stop and Daisy signalled us\nto draw up alongside.\n\n\"Where are we going?\" she cried.\n\n\"How about the movies?\"\n\n\"It's so hot,\" she complained. \"You go. We'll ride around and meet you\nafter.\" With an effort her wit rose faintly, \"We'll meet you on some\ncorner. I'll be the man smoking two cigarettes.\"\n\n\"We can't argue about it here,\" Tom said impatiently as a truck gave\nout a cursing whistle behind us. \"You follow me to the south side of\nCentral Park, in front of the Plaza.\"\n\nSeveral times he turned his head and looked back for their car,\nand if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into\nsight. I think he was afraid they would dart down a side street and out\nof his life forever.\n\nBut they didn't. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging\nthe parlor of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.\n\nThe prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into\nthat room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the\ncourse of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my\nlegs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back. The\nnotion originated with Daisy's suggestion that we hire five bathrooms\nand take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as \"a place to\nhave a mint julep.\" Each of us said over and over that it was a \"crazy\nidea\"--we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or\npretended to think, that we were being very funny. . . .\n\nThe room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four\no'clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from\nthe Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us,\nfixing her hair.\n\n\"It's a swell suite,\" whispered Jordan respectfully and every one\nlaughed.\n\n\"Open another window,\" commanded Daisy, without turning around.\n\n\"There aren't any more.\"\n\n\"Well, we'd better telephone for an axe----\"\n\n\"The thing to do is to forget about the heat,\" said Tom impatiently.\n\"You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.\"\n\nHe unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the towel and put it on the table.\n\n\"Why not let her alone, old sport?\" remarked Gatsby. \"You're the one that\nwanted to come to town.\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its nail\nand splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered \"Excuse me\"--but\nthis time no one laughed.\n\n\"I'll pick it up,\" I offered.\n\n\"I've got it.\" Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered \"Hum!\" in an\ninterested way, and tossed the book on a chair.\n\n\"That's a great expression of yours, isn't it?\" said Tom sharply.\n\n\"What is?\"\n\n\"All this 'old sport' business. Where'd you pick that up?\"\n\n\"Now see here, Tom,\" said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, \"if\nyou're going to make personal remarks I won't stay here a minute. Call\nup and order some ice for the mint julep.\"\n\nAs Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and\nwe were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn's Wedding March\nfrom the ballroom below.\n\n\"Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!\" cried Jordan dismally.\n\n\"Still--I was married in the middle of June,\" Daisy remembered,\n\"Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?\"\n\n\"Biloxi,\" he answered shortly.\n\n\"A man named Biloxi. 'Blocks' Biloxi, and he made boxes--that's a\nfact--and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.\"\n\n\"They carried him into my house,\" appended Jordan, \"because we lived\njust two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy\ntold him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died.\" After a\nmoment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, \"There\nwasn't any connection.\"\n\n\"I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,\" I remarked.\n\n\"That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left.\nHe gave me an aluminum putter that I use today.\"\n\nThe music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated\nin at the window, followed by intermittent cries of \"Yea--ea--ea!\"\nand finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.\n\n\"We're getting old,\" said Daisy. \"If we were young we'd rise and dance.\"\n\n\"Remember Biloxi,\" Jordan warned her. \"Where'd you know him, Tom?\"\n\n\"Biloxi?\" He concentrated with an effort. \"I didn't know him. He was a\nfriend of Daisy's.\"\n\n\"He was not,\" she denied. \"I'd never seen him before. He came down in\nthe private car.\"\n\n\"Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville.\nAsa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room\nfor him.\"\n\nJordan smiled.\n\n\"He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of\nyour class at Yale.\"\n\nTom and I looked at each other blankly.\n\n\"BilOxi?\"\n\n\"First place, we didn't have any president----\"\n\nGatsby's foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.\n\n\"By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you're an Oxford man.\"\n\n\"Not exactly.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.\"\n\n\"Yes--I went there.\"\n\nA pause. Then Tom's voice, incredulous and insulting:\n\n\"You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.\"\n\nAnother pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but\nthe silence was unbroken by his \"Thank you\" and the soft closing of the\ndoor. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.\n\n\"I told you I went there,\" said Gatsby.\n\n\"I heard you, but I'd like to know when.\"\n\n\"It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That's why I\ncan't really call myself an Oxford man.\"\n\nTom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all\nlooking at Gatsby.\n\n\"It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the\nArmistice,\" he continued. \"We could go to any of the universities in\nEngland or France.\"\n\nI wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those renewals\nof complete faith in him that I'd experienced before.\n\nDaisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.\n\n\"Open the whiskey, Tom,\" she ordered. \"And I'll make you a mint julep.\nThen you won't seem so stupid to yourself. . . . Look at the mint!\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" snapped Tom, \"I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more\nquestion.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" Gatsby said politely.\n\n\"What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?\"\n\nThey were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.\n\n\"He isn't causing a row.\" Daisy looked desperately from one to the\nother. \"You're causing a row. Please have a little self control.\"\n\n\"Self control!\" repeated Tom incredulously. \"I suppose the latest thing\nis to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife.\nWell, if that's the idea you can count me out. . . . Nowadays people begin\nby sneering at family life and family institutions and next they'll\nthrow everything overboard and have intermarriage between black\nand white.\"\n\nFlushed with his impassioned gibberish he saw himself standing alone on\nthe last barrier of civilization.\n\n\"We're all white here,\" murmured Jordan.\n\n\"I know I'm not very popular. I don't give big parties. I suppose\nyou've got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any\nfriends--in the modern world.\"\n\nAngry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened\nhis mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so complete.\n\n\"I've got something to tell YOU, old sport,----\" began Gatsby. But Daisy\nguessed at his intention.\n\n\"Please don't!\" she interrupted helplessly. \"Please let's all go home.\nWhy don't we all go home?\"\n\n\"That's a good idea.\" I got up. \"Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.\"\n\n\"I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.\"\n\n\"Your wife doesn't love you,\" said Gatsby. \"She's never loved you.\nShe loves me.\"\n\n\"You must be crazy!\" exclaimed Tom automatically.\n\nGatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.\n\n\"She never loved you, do you hear?\" he cried. \"She only married you\nbecause I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible\nmistake, but in her heart she never loved any one except me!\"\n\nAt this point Jordan and I tried to go but Tom and Gatsby insisted with\ncompetitive firmness that we remain--as though neither of them had\nanything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously\nof their emotions.\n\n\"Sit down Daisy.\" Tom's voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal\nnote. \"What's been going on? I want to hear all about it.\"\n\n\"I told you what's been going on,\" said Gatsby. \"Going on for five\nyears--and you didn't know.\"\n\nTom turned to Daisy sharply.\n\n\"You've been seeing this fellow for five years?\"\n\n\"Not seeing,\" said Gatsby. \"No, we couldn't meet. But both of us loved\neach other all that time, old sport, and you didn't know. I used to laugh\nsometimes--\"but there was no laughter in his eyes, \"to think that you\ndidn't know.\"\n\n\"Oh--that's all.\" Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman\nand leaned back in his chair.\n\n\"You're crazy!\" he exploded. \"I can't speak about what happened five years\nago, because I didn't know Daisy then--and I'll be damned if I see how you\ngot within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back\ndoor. But all the rest of that's a God Damned lie. Daisy loved me when\nshe married me and she loves me now.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Gatsby, shaking his head.\n\n\"She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas\nin her head and doesn't know what she's doing.\" He nodded sagely. \"And\nwhat's more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree\nand make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I\nlove her all the time.\"\n\n\"You're revolting,\" said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice,\ndropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: \"Do you\nknow why we left Chicago? I'm surprised that they didn't treat you to\nthe story of that little spree.\"\n\nGatsby walked over and stood beside her.\n\n\"Daisy, that's all over now,\" he said earnestly. \"It doesn't matter any\nmore. Just tell him the truth--that you never loved him--and it's all\nwiped out forever.\"\n\nShe looked at him blindly. \"Why,--how could I love him--possibly?\"\n\n\"You never loved him.\"\n\nShe hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal,\nas though she realized at last what she was doing--and as though she had\nnever, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done now.\nIt was too late.\n\n\"I never loved him,\" she said, with perceptible reluctance.\n\n\"Not at Kapiolani?\" demanded Tom suddenly.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nFrom the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up\non hot waves of air.\n\n\"Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes\ndry?\" There was a husky tenderness in his tone. \". . . Daisy?\"\n\n\"Please don't.\" Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it.\nShe looked at Gatsby. \"There, Jay,\" she said--but her hand as she tried\nto light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette and\nthe burning match on the carpet.\n\n\"Oh, you want too much!\" she cried to Gatsby. \"I love you now--isn't that\nenough? I can't help what's past.\" She began to sob helplessly.\n\"I did love him once--but I loved you too.\"\n\nGatsby's eyes opened and closed.\n\n\"You loved me TOO?\" he repeated.\n\n\"Even that's a lie,\" said Tom savagely. \"She didn't know you were alive.\nWhy,--there're things between Daisy and me that you'll never know,\nthings that neither of us can ever forget.\"\n\nThe words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.\n\n\"I want to speak to Daisy alone,\" he insisted. \"She's all excited now----\"\n\n\"Even alone I can't say I never loved Tom,\" she admitted in a pitiful\nvoice. \"It wouldn't be true.\"\n\n\"Of course it wouldn't,\" agreed Tom.\n\nShe turned to her husband.\n\n\"As if it mattered to you,\" she said.\n\n\"Of course it matters. I'm going to take better care of you from now on.\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. \"You're not\ngoing to take care of her any more.\"\n\n\"I'm not?\" Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to\ncontrol himself now. \"Why's that?\"\n\n\"Daisy's leaving you.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\n\"I am, though,\" she said with a visible effort.\n\n\"She's not leaving me!\" Tom's words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby.\n\"Certainly not for a common swindler who'd have to steal the ring he\nput on her finger.\"\n\n\"I won't stand this!\" cried Daisy. \"Oh, please let's get out.\"\n\n\"Who are you, anyhow?\" broke out Tom. \"You're one of that bunch that\nhangs around with Meyer Wolfsheim--that much I happen to know. I've made\na little investigation into your affairs--and I'll carry it further\ntomorrow.\"\n\n\"You can suit yourself about that, old sport.\" said Gatsby steadily.\n\n\"I found out what your 'drug stores' were.\" He turned to us and spoke\nrapidly. \"He and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of side-street drug stores\nhere and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. That's one of\nhis little stunts. I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw\nhim and I wasn't far wrong.\"\n\n\"What about it?\" said Gatsby politely. \"I guess your friend Walter Chase\nwasn't too proud to come in on it.\"\n\n\"And you left him in the lurch, didn't you? You let him go to jail for\na month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the subject\nof YOU.\"\n\n\"He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old\nsport.\"\n\n\"Don't you call me 'old sport'!\" cried Tom. Gatsby said nothing.\n\"Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfsheim scared\nhim into shutting his mouth.\"\n\nThat unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby's face.\n\n\"That drug store business was just small change,\" continued Tom slowly,\n\"but you've got something on now that Walter's afraid to tell me\nabout.\"\n\nI glanced at Daisy who was staring terrified between Gatsby\nand her husband and at Jordan who had begun to balance an invisible\nbut absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to\nGatsby--and was startled at his expression. He looked--and this is said\nin all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden--as if he had\n\"killed a man.\" For a moment the set of his face could be described in\njust that fantastic way.\n\nIt passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything,\ndefending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with\nevery word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave\nthat up and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped\naway, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling\nunhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.\n\nThe voice begged again to go.\n\n\"PLEASE, Tom! I can't stand this any more.\"\n\nHer frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage\nshe had had, were definitely gone.\n\n\"You two start on home, Daisy,\" said Tom. \"In Mr. Gatsby's car.\"\n\nShe looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous scorn.\n\n\"Go on. He won't annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous\nlittle flirtation is over.\"\n\nThey were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental, isolated,\nlike ghosts even from our pity.\n\nAfter a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of\nwhiskey in the towel.\n\n\"Want any of this stuff? Jordan? . . . Nick?\"\n\nI didn't answer.\n\n\"Nick?\" He asked again.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Want any?\"\n\n\"No . . . I just remembered that today's my birthday.\"\n\nI was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous menacing road of a\nnew decade.\n\nIt was seven o'clock when we got into the coup\u00e9 with him and started\nfor Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but his\nvoice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamor on the\nsidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead. Human sympathy\nhas its limits and we were content to let all their tragic arguments\nfade with the city lights behind. Thirty--the promise of a decade\nof loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning\nbrief-case of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside\nme who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten\ndreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face\nfell lazily against my coat's shoulder and the formidable stroke of\nthirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.\n\nSo we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.\n\n\nThe young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the\nashheaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had slept through\nthe heat until after five, when he strolled over to the garage and\nfound George Wilson sick in his office--really sick, pale as his own\npale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go to bed but\nWilson refused, saying that he'd miss a lot of business if he did.\nWhile his neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke\nout overhead.\n\n\"I've got my wife locked in up there,\" explained Wilson calmly.\n\"She's going to stay there till the day after tomorrow and then we're\ngoing to move away.\"\n\nMichaelis was astonished; they had been neighbors for four years and\nWilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement. Generally\nhe was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn't working he sat on a\nchair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed\nalong the road. When any one spoke to him he invariably laughed in an\nagreeable, colorless way. He was his wife's man and not his own.\n\nSo naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson\nwouldn't say a word--instead he began to throw curious, suspicious\nglances at his visitor and ask him what he'd been doing at certain\ntimes on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy some\nworkmen came past the door bound for his restaurant and Michaelis took\nthe opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he didn't.\nHe supposed he forgot to, that's all. When he came outside again\na little after seven he was reminded of the conversation because he\nheard Mrs. Wilson's voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in the garage.\n\n\"Beat me!\" he heard her cry. \"Throw me down and beat me, you dirty\nlittle coward!\"\n\nA moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and\nshouting; before he could move from his door the business was over.\n\nThe \"death car\" as the newspapers called it, didn't stop; it came out\nof the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment and then\ndisappeared around the next bend. Michaelis wasn't even sure of its\ncolor--he told the first policeman that it was light green. The other\ncar, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards\nbeyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life\nviolently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick, dark\nblood with the dust.\n\nMichaelis and this man reached her first but when they had torn open\nher shirtwaist still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left\nbreast was swinging loose like a flap and there was no need to listen\nfor the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped at the\ncorners as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous\nvitality she had stored so long.\n\n\nWe saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still\nsome distance away.\n\n\"Wreck!\" said Tom. \"That's good. Wilson'll have a little business\nat last.\"\n\nHe slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping until,\nas we came nearer, the hushed intent faces of the people at the garage\ndoor made him automatically put on the brakes.\n\n\"We'll take a look,\" he said doubtfully, \"just a look.\"\n\nI became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly\nfrom the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coup\u00e9 and walked\ntoward the door resolved itself into the words \"Oh, my God!\" uttered over\nand over in a gasping moan.\n\n\"There's some bad trouble here,\" said Tom excitedly.\n\nHe reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the\ngarage which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging wire basket\noverhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat and with a violent\nthrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through.\n\nThe circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it\nwas a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals\ndisarranged the line and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.\n\nMyrtle Wilson's body wrapped in a blanket and then in another\nblanket as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night lay on a\nwork table by the wall and Tom, with his back to us, was bending over\nit, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down\nnames with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I\ncouldn't find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed\nclamorously through the bare garage--then I saw Wilson standing on the\nraised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to\nthe doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low\nvoice and attempting from time to time to lay a hand on his shoulder,\nbut Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly from the\nswinging light to the laden table by the wall and then jerk back to\nthe light again and he gave out incessantly his high horrible call.\n\n\"O, my Ga-od! O, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!\"\n\nPresently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and after staring around the\ngarage with glazed eyes addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the\npoliceman.\n\n\"M-a-v--\" the policeman was saying, \"--o----\"\n\n\"No,--r--\" corrected the man, \"M-a-v-r-o----\"\n\n\"Listen to me!\" muttered Tom fiercely.\n\n\"r--\" said the policeman, \"o----\"\n\n\"g----\"\n\n\"g--\" He looked up as Tom's broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder.\n\"What you want, fella?\"\n\n\"What happened--that's what I want to know!\"\n\n\"Auto hit her. Ins'antly killed.\"\n\n\"Instantly killed,\" repeated Tom, staring.\n\n\"She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn't even stopus car.\"\n\n\"There was two cars,\" said Michaelis, \"one comin', one goin', see?\"\n\n\"Going where?\" asked the policeman keenly.\n\n\"One goin' each way. Well, she--\" His hand rose toward the blankets but\nstopped half way and fell to his side, \"--she ran out there an' the one\ncomin' from N'York knock right into her goin' thirty or forty miles an\nhour.\"\n\n\"What's the name of this place here?\" demanded the officer.\n\n\"Hasn't got any name.\"\n\nA pale, well-dressed Negro stepped near.\n\n\"It was a yellow car,\" he said, \"big yellow car. New.\"\n\n\"See the accident?\" asked the policeman.\n\n\"No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster'n forty. Going\nfifty, sixty.\"\n\n\"Come here and let's have your name. Look out now. I want to get his\nname.\"\n\nSome words of this conversation must have reached Wilson swaying\nin the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among\nhis gasping cries.\n\n\"You don't have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of\ncar it was!\"\n\nWatching Tom I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten\nunder his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and standing\nin front of him seized him firmly by the upper arms.\n\n\"You've got to pull yourself together,\" he said with soothing\ngruffness.\n\nWilson's eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then\nwould have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.\n\n\"Listen,\" said Tom, shaking him a little. \"I just got here a minute ago,\nfrom New York. I was bringing you that coup\u00e9 we've been talking about.\nThat yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn't mine, do you hear? I\nhaven't seen it all afternoon.\"\n\nOnly the Negro and I were near enough to hear what he said but the\npoliceman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent\neyes.\n\n\"What's all that?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I'm a friend of his.\" Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on\nWilson's body. \"He says he knows the car that did it. . . . It was a yellow\ncar.\"\n\nSome dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.\n\n\"And what color's your car?\"\n\n\"It's a blue car, a coup\u00e9.\"\n\n\"We've come straight from New York,\" I said.\n\nSome one who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this and\nthe policeman turned away.\n\n\"Now, if you'll let me have that name again correct----\"\n\nPicking up Wilson like a doll Tom carried him into the office,\nset him down in a chair and came back.\n\n\"If somebody'll come here and sit with him!\" he snapped\nauthoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced\nat each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the\ndoor on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the\ntable. As he passed close to me he whispered \"Let's get out.\"\n\nSelf consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we\npushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor,\ncase in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.\n\nTom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend--then his foot came down\nhard and the coup\u00e9 raced along through the night. In a little while I\nheard a low husky sob and saw that the tears were overflowing down his\nface.\n\n\"The God Damn coward!\" he whimpered. \"He didn't even stop his car.\"\n\n\nThe Buchanans' house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling\ntrees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor\nwhere two windows bloomed with light among the vines.\n\n\"Daisy's home,\" he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and\nfrowned slightly.\n\n\"I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There's nothing we can\ndo tonight.\"\n\nA change had come over him and he spoke gravely, and with decision.\nAs we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of\nthe situation in a few brisk phrases.\n\n\"I'll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you're waiting\nyou and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some\nsupper--if you want any.\" He opened the door. \"Come in.\"\n\n\"No thanks. But I'd be glad if you'd order me the taxi. I'll wait\noutside.\"\n\nJordan put her hand on my arm.\n\n\"Won't you come in, Nick?\"\n\n\"No thanks.\"\n\nI was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan lingered\nfor a moment more.\n\n\"It's only half past nine,\" she said.\n\nI'd be damned if I'd go in; I'd had enough of all of them for one day\nand suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of\nthis in my expression for she turned abruptly away and ran up the\nporch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head\nin my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler's\nvoice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the\nhouse intending to wait by the gate.\n\nI hadn't gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from\nbetween two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird by that\ntime because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his\npink suit under the moon.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Just standing here, old sport.\"\n\nSomehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was going\nto rob the house in a moment; I wouldn't have been surprised to see\nsinister faces, the faces of \"Wolfsheim's people,\" behind him in the\ndark shrubbery.\n\n\"Did you see any trouble on the road?\" he asked after a minute.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe hesitated.\n\n\"Was she killed?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It's better that the shock\nshould all come at once. She stood it pretty well.\"\n\nHe spoke as if Daisy's reaction was the only thing that mattered.\n\n\"I got to West Egg by a side road,\" he went on, \"and left the car in my\ngarage. I don't think anybody saw us but of course I can't be sure.\"\n\nI disliked him so much by this time that I didn't find it necessary to\ntell him he was wrong.\n\n\"Who was the woman?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it\nhappen?\"\n\n\"Well, I tried to swing the wheel----\" He broke off, and suddenly I\nguessed at the truth.\n\n\"Was Daisy driving?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said after a moment, \"but of course I'll say I was. You see,\nwhen we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would\nsteady her to drive--and this woman rushed out at us just as we were\npassing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute but it\nseemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody\nshe knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other\ncar, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second my hand\nreached the wheel I felt the shock--it must have killed her instantly.\"\n\n\"It ripped her open----\"\n\n\"Don't tell me, old sport.\" He winced. \"Anyhow--Daisy stepped on it.\nI tried to make her stop, but she couldn't so I pulled on the emergency\nbrake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.\n\n\"She'll be all right tomorrow,\" he said presently. \"I'm just going to\nwait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness\nthis afternoon. She's locked herself into her room and if he tries any\nbrutality she's going to turn the light out and on again.\"\n\n\"He won't touch her,\" I said. \"He's not thinking about her.\"\n\n\"I don't trust him, old sport.\"\n\n\"How long are you going to wait?\"\n\n\"All night if necessary. Anyhow till they all go to bed.\"\n\nA new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had\nbeen driving. He might think he saw a connection in it--he might think\nanything. I looked at the house: there were two or three bright windows\ndownstairs and the pink glow from Daisy's room on the second floor.\n\n\"You wait here,\" I said. \"I'll see if there's any sign of a commotion.\"\n\nI walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly\nand tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains were open,\nand I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where we had dined\nthat June night three months before I came to a small rectangle of light\nwhich I guessed was the pantry window. The blind was drawn but I found\na rift at the sill.\n\nDaisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table\nwith a plate of cold fried chicken between them and two bottles of\nale. He was talking intently across the table at her and in his\nearnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a\nwhile she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.\n\nThey weren't happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the\nale--and yet they weren't unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air\nof natural intimacy about the picture and anybody would have said that\nthey were conspiring together.\n\nAs I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the\ndark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in\nthe drive.\n\n\"Is it all quiet up there?\" he asked anxiously.\n\n\"Yes, it's all quiet.\" I hesitated. \"You'd better come home and get\nsome sleep.\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.\"\n\nHe put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his\nscrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of\nthe vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the\nmoonlight--watching over nothing.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\n\n\nI couldn't sleep all night; a fog-horn was groaning incessantly on the\nSound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage\nfrightening dreams. Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby's drive\nand immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress--I felt that I\nhad something to tell him, something to warn him about and morning\nwould be too late.\n\nCrossing his lawn I saw that his front door was still open and he was\nleaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.\n\n\"Nothing happened,\" he said wanly. \"I waited, and about four o'clock she\ncame to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out\nthe light.\"\n\nHis house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we\nhunted through the great rooms for cigarettes. We pushed aside curtains\nthat were like pavilions and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for\nelectric light switches--once I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the\nkeys of a ghostly piano. There was an inexplicable amount of dust\neverywhere and the rooms were musty as though they hadn't been aired for\nmany days. I found the humidor on an unfamiliar table with two stale dry\ncigarettes inside. Throwing open the French windows of the\ndrawing-room we sat smoking out into the darkness.\n\n\"You ought to go away,\" I said. \"It's pretty certain they'll trace\nyour car.\"\n\n\"Go away NOW, old sport?\"\n\n\"Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal.\"\n\nHe wouldn't consider it. He couldn't possibly leave Daisy until he knew\nwhat she was going to do. He was clutching at some last hope and I\ncouldn't bear to shake him free.\n\nIt was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with\nDan Cody--told it to me because \"Jay Gatsby\" had broken up like glass\nagainst Tom's hard malice and the long secret extravaganza was played\nout. I think that he would have acknowledged anything, now, without\nreserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.\n\nShe was the first \"nice\" girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed\ncapacities he had come in contact with such people but always\nwith indiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly\ndesirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers\nfrom Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him--he had never been\nin such a beautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless\nintensity was that Daisy lived there--it was as casual a thing to her\nas his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it,\na hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other\nbedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its\ncorridors and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in\nlavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year's shining\nmotor cars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered. It\nexcited him too that many men had already loved Daisy--it increased\nher value in his eyes. He felt their presence all about the house,\npervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.\n\nBut he knew that he was in Daisy's house by a colossal accident.\nHowever glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a\npenniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible\ncloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he made\nthe most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and\nunscrupulously--eventually he took Daisy one still October night,\ntook her because he had no real right to touch her hand.\n\nHe might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under\nfalse pretenses. I don't mean that he had traded on his phantom\nmillions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he\nlet her believe that he was a person from much the same stratum as\nherself--that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of\nfact he had no such facilities--he had no comfortable family standing\nbehind him and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government\nto be blown anywhere about the world.\n\nBut he didn't despise himself and it didn't turn out as he had\nimagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go--but\nnow he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail.\nHe knew that Daisy was extraordinary but he didn't realize just how\nextraordinary a \"nice\" girl could be. She vanished into her rich\nhouse, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby--nothing. He felt\nmarried to her, that was all.\n\nWhen they met again two days later it was Gatsby who was breathless,\nwho was somehow betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought\nluxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably\nas she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth.\nShe had caught a cold and it made her voice huskier and more charming\nthan ever and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery\nthat wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes\nand of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot\nstruggles of the poor.\n\n\n\"I can't describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her,\nold sport. I even hoped for a while that she'd throw me over, but she\ndidn't, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot\nbecause I knew different things from her. . . . Well, there I was,\nway off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and\nall of a sudden I didn't care. What was the use of doing great\nthings if I could have a better time telling her what I was going\nto do?\"\n\nOn the last afternoon before he went abroad he sat with Daisy in\nhis arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day with fire\nin the room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he\nchanged his arm a little and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The\nafternoon had made them tranquil for a while as if to give them a deep\nmemory for the long parting the next day promised. They had never been\ncloser in their month of love nor communicated more profoundly one\nwith another than when she brushed silent lips against his coat's\nshoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though\nshe were asleep.\n\n\nHe did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before he went\nto the front and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and\nthe command of the divisional machine guns. After the Armistice\nhe tried frantically to get home but some complication or\nmisunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now--there\nwas a quality of nervous despair in Daisy's letters. She didn't see why\nhe couldn't come. She was feeling the pressure of the world outside\nand she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be\nreassured that she was doing the right thing after all.\n\nFor Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids\nand pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of\nthe year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new\ntunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the\n\"Beale Street Blues\" while a hundred pairs of golden and silver\nslippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were\nalways rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low sweet fever,\nwhile fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the\nsad horns around the floor.\n\nThrough this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the\nseason; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with\nhalf a dozen men and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and\nchiffon of an evening dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor\nbeside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a\ndecision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately--and the decision\nmust be made by some force--of love, of money, of unquestionable\npracticality--that was close at hand.\n\nThat force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom\nBuchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his\nposition and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certain\nstruggle and a certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby while he was\nstill at Oxford.\n\n\nIt was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of\nthe windows downstairs, filling the house with grey turning,\ngold turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew\nand ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a\nslow pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool\nlovely day.\n\n\"I don't think she ever loved him.\" Gatsby turned around from a window\nand looked at me challengingly. \"You must remember, old sport, she was\nvery excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that\nfrightened her--that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper.\nAnd the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.\"\n\nHe sat down gloomily.\n\n\"Of course she might have loved him, just for a minute, when they were\nfirst married--and loved me more even then, do you see?\"\n\nSuddenly he came out with a curious remark:\n\n\"In any case,\" he said, \"it was just personal.\"\n\nWhat could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in\nhis conception of the affair that couldn't be measured?\n\nHe came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding\ntrip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville\non the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week, walking the\nstreets where their footsteps had clicked together through the\nNovember night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which\nthey had driven in her white car. Just as Daisy's house had always\nseemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses so his\nidea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded\nwith a melancholy beauty.\n\nHe left feeling that if he had searched harder he might have found\nher--that he was leaving her behind. The day-coach--he was penniless\nnow--was hot. He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a\nfolding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar\nbuildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow\ntrolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have\nseen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.\n\nThe track curved and now it was going away from the sun which, as it\nsank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing\ncity where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand\ndesperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of\nthe spot that she had made lovely for him. But it was all going by too\nfast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of\nit, the freshest and the best, forever.\n\n\nIt was nine o'clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the\nporch. The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there\nwas an autumn flavor in the air. The gardener, the last one of Gatsby's\nformer servants, came to the foot of the steps.\n\n\"I'm going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. Leaves'll start falling\npretty soon and then there's always trouble with the pipes.\"\n\n\"Don't do it today,\" Gatsby answered. He turned to me apologetically.\n\"You know, old sport, I've never used that pool all summer?\"\n\nI looked at my watch and stood up.\n\n\"Twelve minutes to my train.\"\n\nI didn't want to go to the city. I wasn't worth a decent stroke of work\nbut it was more than that--I didn't want to leave Gatsby. I missed that\ntrain, and then another, before I could get myself away.\n\n\"I'll call you up,\" I said finally.\n\n\"Do, old sport.\"\n\n\"I'll call you about noon.\"\n\nWe walked slowly down the steps.\n\n\"I suppose Daisy'll call too.\" He looked at me anxiously as if he\nhoped I'd corroborate this.\n\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\n\"Well--goodbye.\"\n\nWe shook hands and I started away. Just before I reached the hedge I\nremembered something and turned around.\n\n\"They're a rotten crowd,\" I shouted across the lawn. \"You're worth the\nwhole damn bunch put together.\"\n\nI've always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever gave\nhim, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end. First he nodded\npolitely, and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding\nsmile, as if we'd been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time.\nHis gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of color against the\nwhite steps and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral\nhome three months before. The lawn and drive had been crowded with the\nfaces of those who guessed at his corruption--and he had stood on those\nsteps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye.\n\nI thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thanking him for\nthat--I and the others.\n\n\"Goodbye,\" I called. \"I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.\"\n\n\nUp in the city I tried for a while to list the quotations on an\ninterminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair.\nJust before noon the phone woke me and I started up with sweat\nbreaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker; she often called\nme up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements\nbetween hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find\nin any other way. Usually her voice came over the wire as something\nfresh and cool as if a divot from a green golf links had come\nsailing in at the office window but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.\n\n\"I've left Daisy's house,\" she said. \"I'm at Hempstead and I'm going down\nto Southampton this afternoon.\"\n\nProbably it had been tactful to leave Daisy's house, but the act\nannoyed me and her next remark made me rigid.\n\n\"You weren't so nice to me last night.\"\n\n\"How could it have mattered then?\"\n\nSilence for a moment. Then--\n\n\"However--I want to see you.\"\n\n\"I want to see you too.\"\n\n\"Suppose I don't go to Southampton, and come into town this afternoon?\"\n\n\"No--I don't think this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\"It's impossible this afternoon. Various----\"\n\nWe talked like that for a while and then abruptly we weren't talking any\nlonger. I don't know which of us hung up with a sharp click but I know I\ndidn't care. I couldn't have talked to her across a tea-table that day if\nI never talked to her again in this world.\n\nI called Gatsby's house a few minutes later, but the line was busy. I\ntried four times; finally an exasperated central told me the wire was\nbeing kept open for long distance from Detroit. Taking out my\ntime-table I drew a small circle around the three-fifty train. Then I\nleaned back in my chair and tried to think. It was just noon.\n\n\nWhen I passed the ashheaps on the train that morning I had crossed\ndeliberately to the other side of the car. I suppose there'd be a\ncurious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark\nspots in the dust and some garrulous man telling over and over what\nhad happened until it became less and less real even to him and he\ncould tell it no longer and Myrtle Wilson's tragic achievement was\nforgotten. Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at the\ngarage after we left there the night before.\n\nThey had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine. She must\nhave broken her rule against drinking that night for when she\narrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the\nambulance had already gone to Flushing. When they convinced her of\nthis she immediately fainted as if that was the intolerable part of\nthe affair. Someone kind or curious took her in his car and drove\nher in the wake of her sister's body.\n\nUntil long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front\nof the garage while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the\ncouch inside. For a while the door of the office was open and\neveryone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it.\nFinally someone said it was a shame and closed the door. Michaelis and\nseveral other men were with him--first four or five men, later two or\nthree men. Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger to wait\nthere fifteen minutes longer while he went back to his own place and made\na pot of coffee. After that he stayed there alone with Wilson until dawn.\n\nAbout three o'clock the quality of Wilson's incoherent muttering\nchanged--he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car. He\nannounced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged\nto, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had\ncome from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen.\n\nBut when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry \"Oh,\nmy God!\" again in his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt\nto distract him.\n\n\"How long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sit\nstill a minute and answer my question. How long have you been married?\"\n\n\"Twelve years.\"\n\n\"Ever had any children? Come on, George, sit still--I asked you a\nquestion. Did you ever have any children?\"\n\nThe hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light and whenever\nMichaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him\nlike the car that hadn't stopped a few hours before. He didn't like to go\ninto the garage because the work bench was stained where the body had\nbeen lying so he moved uncomfortably around the office--he knew every\nobject in it before morning--and from time to time sat down beside Wilson\ntrying to keep him more quiet.\n\n\"Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if you\nhaven't been there for a long time? Maybe I could call up the church\nand get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?\"\n\n\"Don't belong to any.\"\n\n\"You ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must have\ngone to church once. Didn't you get married in a church? Listen, George,\nlisten to me. Didn't you get married in a church?\"\n\n\"That was a long time ago.\"\n\nThe effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking--for a moment he\nwas silent. Then the same half knowing, half bewildered look came back\ninto his faded eyes.\n\n\"Look in the drawer there,\" he said, pointing at the desk.\n\n\"Which drawer?\"\n\n\"That drawer--that one.\"\n\nMichaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it but\na small expensive dog leash made of leather and braided silver. It was\napparently new.\n\n\"This?\" he inquired, holding it up.\n\nWilson stared and nodded.\n\n\"I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it but I\nknew it was something funny.\"\n\n\"You mean your wife bought it?\"\n\n\"She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.\"\n\nMichaelis didn't see anything odd in that and he gave Wilson a dozen\nreasons why his wife might have bought the dog leash. But conceivably\nWilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle,\nbecause he began saying \"Oh, my God!\" again in a whisper--his comforter\nleft several explanations in the air.\n\n\"Then he killed her,\" said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly.\n\n\"Who did?\"\n\n\"I have a way of finding out.\"\n\n\"You're morbid, George,\" said his friend. \"This has been a strain to you\nand you don't know what you're saying. You'd better try and sit quiet\ntill morning.\"\n\n\"He murdered her.\"\n\n\"It was an accident, George.\"\n\nWilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly\nwith the ghost of a superior \"Hm!\"\n\n\"I know,\" he said definitely, \"I'm one of these trusting fellas and I\ndon't think any harm to NObody, but when I get to know a thing I know\nit. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he\nwouldn't stop.\"\n\nMichaelis had seen this too but it hadn't occurred to him that there was\nany special significance in it. He believed that Mrs. Wilson had been\nrunning away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any\nparticular car.\n\n\"How could she of been like that?\"\n\n\"She's a deep one,\" said Wilson, as if that answered the question.\n\"Ah-h-h----\"\n\nHe began to rock again and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in\nhis hand.\n\n\"Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?\"\n\nThis was a forlorn hope--he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend:\nthere was not enough of him for his wife. He was glad a little later when\nhe noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and\nrealized that dawn wasn't far off. About five o'clock it was blue enough\noutside to snap off the light.\n\nWilson's glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps, where small grey\nclouds took on fantastic shape and scurried here and there in the faint\ndawn wind.\n\n\"I spoke to her,\" he muttered, after a long silence. \"I told her she might\nfool me but she couldn't fool God. I took her to the window--\" With an\neffort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face\npressed against it, \"--and I said 'God knows what you've been doing,\neverything you've been doing. You may fool me but you can't fool God!' \"\n\nStanding behind him Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the\neyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg which had just emerged pale and enormous\nfrom the dissolving night.\n\n\"God sees everything,\" repeated Wilson.\n\n\"That's an advertisement,\" Michaelis assured him. Something made him turn\naway from the window and look back into the room. But Wilson stood there a\nlong time, his face close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight.\n\n\nBy six o'clock Michaelis was worn out and grateful for the sound of a\ncar stopping outside. It was one of the watchers of the night before\nwho had promised to come back so he cooked breakfast for three which\nhe and the other man ate together. Wilson was quieter now and Michaelis\nwent home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the\ngarage Wilson was gone.\n\nHis movements--he was on foot all the time--were afterward traced to Port\nRoosevelt and then to Gad's Hill where he bought a sandwich that he\ndidn't eat and a cup of coffee. He must have been tired and walking\nslowly for he didn't reach Gad's Hill until noon. Thus far there was\nno difficulty in accounting for his time--there were boys who had seen a\nman \"acting sort of crazy\" and motorists at whom he stared oddly from\nthe side of the road. Then for three hours he disappeared from view.\nThe police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he \"had\na way of finding out,\" supposed that he spent that time going from\ngarage to garage thereabouts inquiring for a yellow car. On the other\nhand no garage man who had seen him ever came forward--and perhaps he\nhad an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to know. By\nhalf past two he was in West Egg where he asked someone the way to\nGatsby's house. So by that time he knew Gatsby's name.\n\n\nAt two o'clock Gatsby put on his bathing suit and left word with the\nbutler that if any one phoned word was to be brought to him at the\npool. He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused\nhis guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him pump it up.\nThen he gave instructions that the open car wasn't to be taken out\nunder any circumstances--and this was strange because the front right\nfender needed repair.\n\nGatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once he\nstopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he\nneeded help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among\nthe yellowing trees.\n\nNo telephone message arrived but the butler went without his sleep and\nwaited for it until four o'clock--until long after there was any one to\ngive it to if it came. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn't\nbelieve it would come and perhaps he no longer cared. If that was true\nhe must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high\nprice for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up\nat an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he\nfound what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was\nupon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being\nreal, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted\nfortuitously about . . . like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward\nhim through the amorphous trees.\n\nThe chauffeur--he was one of Wolfsheim's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s--heard the\nshots--afterward he could only say that he hadn't thought anything much\nabout them. I drove from the station directly to Gatsby's house and my\nrushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed any\none. But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a word said, four\nof us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener and I, hurried down to the pool.\n\nThere was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the\nfresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other.\nWith little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden\nmattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that\nscarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental\ncourse with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves\nrevolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of compass, a thin red circle\nin the water.\n\nIt was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener\nsaw Wilson's body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was\ncomplete.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\n\n\nAfter two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the\nnext day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and\nnewspaper men in and out of Gatsby's front door. A rope stretched\nacross the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but\nlittle boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard and\nthere were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the pool.\nSomeone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the\nexpression \"mad man\" as he bent over Wilson's body that afternoon, and\nthe adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper\nreports next morning.\n\nMost of those reports were a nightmare--grotesque, circumstantial,\neager and untrue. When Michaelis's testimony at the inquest brought to\nlight Wilson's suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would\nshortly be served up in racy pasquinade--but Catherine, who might have\nsaid anything, didn't say a word. She showed a surprising amount of\ncharacter about it too--looked at the coroner with determined eyes under\nthat corrected brow of hers and swore that her sister had never seen\nGatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her\nsister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced herself of it\nand cried into her handkerchief as if the very suggestion was more\nthan she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a man \"deranged by\ngrief\" in order that the case might remain in its simplest form. And\nit rested there.\n\nBut all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself on\nGatsby's side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of\nthe catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and\nevery practical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and\nconfused; then, as he lay in his house and didn't move or breathe or\nspeak hour upon hour it grew upon me that I was responsible, because no\none else was interested--interested, I mean, with that intense personal\ninterest to which every one has some vague right at the end.\n\nI called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her\ninstinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away\nearly that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.\n\n\"Left no address?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Say when they'd be back?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Any idea where they are? How I could reach them?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Can't say.\"\n\nI wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where he\nlay and reassure him: \"I'll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don't worry.\nJust trust me and I'll get somebody for you----\"\n\nMeyer Wolfsheim's name wasn't in the phone book. The butler gave me his\noffice address on Broadway and I called Information, but by the time I\nhad the number it was long after five and no one answered the phone.\n\n\"Will you ring again?\"\n\n\"I've rung them three times.\"\n\n\"It's very important.\"\n\n\"Sorry. I'm afraid no one's there.\"\n\nI went back to the drawing room and thought for an instant that they were\nchance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it. But\nas they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with unmoved eyes,\nhis protest continued in my brain.\n\n\"Look here, old sport, you've got to get somebody for me. You've got\nto try hard. I can't go through this alone.\"\n\nSome one started to ask me questions but I broke away and going upstairs\nlooked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk--he'd never told me\ndefinitely that his parents were dead. But there was nothing--only the\npicture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence staring down from\nthe wall.\n\nNext morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfsheim\nwhich asked for information and urged him to come out on the next\ntrain. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure he'd\nstart when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there'd be a wire\nfrom Daisy before noon--but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfsheim arrived, no\none arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men.\nWhen the butler brought back Wolfsheim's answer I began to have a\nfeeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me\nagainst them all.\n\n\n_Dear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my\nlife to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a mad\nact as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down now as\nI am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in\nthis thing now. If there is anything I can do a little later let me\nknow in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when I hear about a\nthing like this and am completely knocked down and out.\n\n                                        Yours truly\n                                                      MEYER Wolfsheim_\n\nand then hasty addenda beneath:\n\n_Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all._\n\n\nWhen the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was\ncalling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came\nthrough as a man's voice, very thin and far away.\n\n\"This is Slagle speaking. . . .\"\n\n\"Yes?\" The name was unfamiliar.\n\n\"Hell of a note, isn't it? Get my wire?\"\n\n\"There haven't been any wires.\"\n\n\"Young Parke's in trouble,\" he said rapidly. \"They picked him up when he\nhanded the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New York\ngiving 'em the numbers just five minutes before. What d'you know about\nthat, hey? You never can tell in these hick towns----\"\n\n\"Hello!\" I interrupted breathlessly. \"Look here--this isn't Mr. Gatsby.\nMr. Gatsby's dead.\"\n\nThere was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an\nexclamation . . . then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.\n\n\nI think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz\narrived from a town in Minnesota. It said only that the sender was\nleaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.\n\nIt was Gatsby's father, a solemn old man very helpless and dismayed,\nbundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day. His\neyes leaked continuously with excitement and when I took the bag and\numbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse\ngrey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was on the\npoint of collapse so I took him into the music room and made him sit\ndown while I sent for something to eat. But he wouldn't eat and the\nglass of milk spilled from his trembling hand.\n\n\"I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,\" he said. \"It was all in the Chicago\nnewspaper. I started right away.\"\n\n\"I didn't know how to reach you.\"\n\nHis eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room.\n\n\"It was a mad man,\" he said. \"He must have been mad.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you like some coffee?\" I urged him.\n\n\"I don't want anything. I'm all right now, Mr.----\"\n\n\"Carraway.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?\"\n\nI took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him there.\nSome little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall;\nwhen I told them who had arrived they went reluctantly away.\n\nAfter a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth\najar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and\nunpunctual tears. He had reached an age where death no longer has the\nquality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the\nfirst time and saw the height and splendor of the hall and the great\nrooms opening out from it into other rooms his grief began to be mixed\nwith an awed pride. I helped him to a bedroom upstairs; while he took\noff his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been\ndeferred until he came.\n\n\"I didn't know what you'd want, Mr. Gatsby----\"\n\n\"Gatz is my name.\"\n\n\"--Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body west.\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position in\nthe East. Were you a friend of my boy's, Mr.--?\"\n\n\"We were close friends.\"\n\n\"He had a big future before him, you know. He was only a young man but\nhe had a lot of brain power here.\"\n\nHe touched his head impressively and I nodded.\n\n\"If he'd of lived he'd of been a great man. A man like James J. Hill.\nHe'd of helped build up the country.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" I said, uncomfortably.\n\nHe fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the bed,\nand lay down stiffly--was instantly asleep.\n\nThat night an obviously frightened person called up and demanded to know\nwho I was before he would give his name.\n\n\"This is Mr. Carraway,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh--\" He sounded relieved. \"This is Klipspringer.\"\n\nI was relieved too for that seemed to promise another friend\nat Gatsby's grave. I didn't want it to be in the papers and draw\na sightseeing crowd so I'd been calling up a few people myself.\nThey were hard to find.\n\n\"The funeral's tomorrow,\" I said. \"Three o'clock, here at the house.\nI wish you'd tell anybody who'd be interested.\"\n\n\"Oh, I will,\" he broke out hastily. \"Of course I'm not likely to see\nanybody, but if I do.\"\n\nHis tone made me suspicious.\n\n\"Of course you'll be there yourself.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll certainly try. What I called up about is----\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" I interrupted. \"How about saying you'll come?\"\n\n\"Well, the fact is--the truth of the matter is that I'm staying with\nsome people up here in Greenwich and they rather expect me to be with\nthem tomorrow. In fact there's a sort of picnic or something.\nOf course I'll do my very best to get away.\"\n\nI ejaculated an unrestrained \"Huh!\" and he must have heard me for he went\non nervously:\n\n\"What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. I wonder if\nit'd be too much trouble to have the butler send them on. You\nsee they're tennis shoes and I'm sort of helpless without them. My\naddress is care of B. F.----\"\n\nI didn't hear the rest of the name because I hung up the receiver.\n\nAfter that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby--one gentleman to whom I\ntelephoned implied that he had got what he deserved. However, that was\nmy fault, for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at\nGatsby on the courage of Gatsby's liquor and I should have known\nbetter than to call him.\n\nThe morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer\nWolfsheim; I couldn't seem to reach him any other way. The door that I\npushed open on the advice of an elevator boy was marked \"The Swastika\nHolding Company\" and at first there didn't seem to be any one inside.\nBut when I'd shouted \"Hello\" several times in vain an argument broke\nout behind a partition and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an\ninterior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes.\n\n\"Nobody's in,\" she said. \"Mr. Wolfsheim's gone to Chicago.\"\n\nThe first part of this was obviously untrue for someone had begun to\nwhistle \"The Rosary,\" tunelessly, inside.\n\n\"Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.\"\n\n\"I can't get him back from Chicago, can I?\"\n\nAt this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfsheim's called \"Stella!\"\nfrom the other side of the door.\n\n\"Leave your name on the desk,\" she said quickly. \"I'll give it to him\nwhen he gets back.\"\n\n\"But I know he's there.\"\n\nShe took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up\nand down her hips.\n\n\"You young men think you can force your way in here any time,\" she\nscolded. \"We're getting sickantired of it. When I say he's in Chicago,\nhe's in ChiCAgo.\"\n\nI mentioned Gatsby.\n\n\"Oh--h!\" She looked at me over again. \"Will you just--what was your name?\"\n\nShe vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfsheim stood solemnly in the doorway,\nholding out both hands. He drew me into his office, remarking in a\nreverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered me\na cigar.\n\n\"My memory goes back to when I first met him,\" he said. \"A young\nmajor just out of the army and covered over with medals he got\nin the war. He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform\nbecause he couldn't buy some regular clothes. First time I saw him was\nwhen he come into Winebrenner's poolroom at Forty-third Street and\nasked for a job. He hadn't eat anything for a couple of days. 'Come on\nhave some lunch with me,' I sid. He ate more than four dollars' worth of\nfood in half an hour.\"\n\n\"Did you start him in business?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Start him! I made him.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right\naway he was a fine appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told\nme he was an Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join up\nin the American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he\ndid some work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like\nthat in everything--\" He held up two bulbous fingers \"--always\ntogether.\"\n\nI wondered if this partnership had included the World's Series transaction\nin 1919.\n\n\"Now he's dead,\" I said after a moment. \"You were his closest friend,\nso I know you'll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.\"\n\n\"I'd like to come.\"\n\n\"Well, come then.\"\n\nThe hair in his nostrils quivered slightly and as he shook his head his\neyes filled with tears.\n\n\"I can't do it--I can't get mixed up in it,\" he said.\n\n\"There's nothing to get mixed up in. It's all over now.\"\n\n\"When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way.\nI keep out. When I was a young man it was different--if a friend of mine\ndied, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You may think that's\nsentimental but I mean it--to the bitter end.\"\n\nI saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come,\nso I stood up.\n\n\"Are you a college man?\" he inquired suddenly.\n\nFor a moment I thought he was going to suggest a \"gonnegtion\" but he\nonly nodded and shook my hand.\n\n\"Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not\nafter he is dead,\" he suggested. \"After that my own rule is to let\neverything alone.\"\n\nWhen I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West Egg\nin a drizzle. After changing my clothes I went next door and found\nMr. Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall. His pride in his\nson and in his son's possessions was continually increasing and now he\nhad something to show me.\n\n\"Jimmy sent me this picture.\" He took out his wallet with trembling\nfingers. \"Look there.\"\n\nIt was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirty with\nmany hands. He pointed out every detail to me eagerly. \"Look there!\" and\nthen sought admiration from my eyes. He had shown it so often that I think\nit was more real to him now than the house itself.\n\n\"Jimmy sent it to me. I think it's a very pretty picture. It shows up\nwell.\"\n\n\"Very well. Had you seen him lately?\"\n\n\"He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in\nnow. Of course we was broke up when he run off from home but I see now\nthere was a reason for it. He knew he had a big future in front of him.\nAnd ever since he made a success he was very generous with me.\"\n\nHe seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another minute,\nlingeringly, before my eyes. Then he returned the wallet and pulled from\nhis pocket a ragged old copy of a book called \"Hopalong Cassidy.\"\n\n\"Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows\nyou.\"\n\nHe opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see.\nOn the last fly-leaf was printed the word SCHEDULE, and the date\nSeptember 12th, 1906. And underneath:\n\n\nRise from bed . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  6.00       A.M.\nDumbbell exercise and wall-scaling . . . . . . 6.15-6.30   \"\nStudy electricity, etc . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.15-8.15   \"\nWork . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8.30-4.30  P.M.\nBaseball and sports . . . . . . . . . . . . .  4.30-5.00   \"\nPractice elocution, poise and how to attain it 5.00-6.00   \"\nStudy needed inventions . . . . . . . . . . .  7.00-9.00   \"\n\n                GENERAL RESOLVES\n\nNo wasting time at Shafters or [a name, indecipherable]\nNo more smokeing or chewing\nBath every other day\nRead one improving book or magazine per week\nSave $5.00 [crossed out] $3.00 per week\nBe better to parents\n\n\n\"I come across this book by accident,\" said the old man. \"It just shows\nyou, don't it?\"\n\n\"It just shows you.\"\n\n\"Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this or\nsomething. Do you notice what he's got about improving his mind? He was\nalways great for that. He told me I et like a hog once and I beat him\nfor it.\"\n\nHe was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then\nlooking eagerly at me. I think he rather expected me to copy down the\nlist for my own use.\n\nA little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing and\nI began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars. So did\nGatsby's father. And as the time passed and the servants came in and\nstood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously and he\nspoke of the rain in a worried uncertain way. The minister glanced\nseveral times at his watch so I took him aside and asked him to wait\nfor half an hour. But it wasn't any use. Nobody came.\n\n\nAbout five o'clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery\nand stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate--first a motor hearse,\nhorribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and I in the\nlimousine, and, a little later, four or five servants and the postman\nfrom West Egg in Gatsby's station wagon, all wet to the skin. As we\nstarted through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then\nthe sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. I looked\naround. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found\nmarvelling over Gatsby's books in the library one night three months\nbefore.\n\nI'd never seen him since then. I don't know how he knew about the\nfuneral or even his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses and\nhe took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled\nfrom Gatsby's grave.\n\nI tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment but he was already too\nfar away and I could only remember, without resentment, that Daisy\nhadn't sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur\n\"Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,\" and then the owl-eyed\nman said \"Amen to that,\" in a brave voice.\n\nWe straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-Eyes spoke\nto me by the gate.\n\n\"I couldn't get to the house,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Neither could anybody else.\"\n\n\"Go on!\" He started. \"Why, my God! they used to go there by the\nhundreds.\"\n\nHe took off his glasses and wiped them again outside and in.\n\n\"The poor son-of-a-bitch,\" he said.\n\n\nOne of my most vivid memories is of coming back west from prep school\nand later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than\nChicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o'clock of a\nDecember evening with a few Chicago friends already caught up into\ntheir own holiday gayeties to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember\nthe fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This or That's and\nthe chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as\nwe caught sight of old acquaintances and the matchings of invitations:\n\"Are you going to the Ordways'? the Herseys'? the Schultzes'?\"\nand the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands.\nAnd last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul\nRailroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside\nthe gate.\n\nWhen we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow,\nbegan to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the\ndim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace\ncame suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked\nback from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our\nidentity with this country for one strange hour before we melted\nindistinguishably into it again.\n\nThat's my middle west--not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede\ntowns but the thrilling, returning trains of my youth and the street\nlamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly\nwreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a\nlittle solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent\nfrom growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are\nstill called through decades by a family's name. I see now that this\nhas been a story of the West, after all--Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and\nJordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some\ndeficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.\n\nEven when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware\nof its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the\nOhio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the\nchildren and the very old--even then it had always for me a quality of\ndistortion. West Egg especially still figures in my more fantastic\ndreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at\nonce conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging\nsky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress\nsuits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a\ndrunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over\nthe side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a\nhouse--the wrong house. But no one knows the woman's name, and no one\ncares.\n\nAfter Gatsby's death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted\nbeyond my eyes' power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle\nleaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the\nline I decided to come back home.\n\nThere was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant\nthing that perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted to\nleave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent\nsea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and\naround what had happened to us together and what had happened\nafterward to me, and she lay perfectly still listening in a big\nchair.\n\nShe was dressed to play golf and I remember thinking she looked like a\ngood illustration, her chin raised a little, jauntily, her hair the\ncolor of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless\nglove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without comment that\nshe was engaged to another man. I doubted that though there were\nseveral she could have married at a nod of her head but I pretended to\nbe surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn't making a\nmistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say\ngoodbye.\n\n\"Nevertheless you did throw me over,\" said Jordan suddenly. \"You threw me\nover on the telephone. I don't give a damn about you now but it was a\nnew experience for me and I felt a little dizzy for a while.\"\n\nWe shook hands.\n\n\"Oh, and do you remember--\" she added, \"----a conversation we had once\nabout driving a car?\"\n\n\"Why--not exactly.\"\n\n\"You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver?\nWell, I met another bad driver, didn't I? I mean it was careless of me\nto make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest,\nstraightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.\"\n\n\"I'm thirty,\" I said. \"I'm five years too old to lie to myself and call\nit honor.\"\n\nShe didn't answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously\nsorry, I turned away.\n\n\nOne afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead\nof me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a\nlittle from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving\nsharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as I\nslowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into\nthe windows of a jewelry store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back\nholding out his hand.\n\n\"What's the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?\"\n\n\"Yes. You know what I think of you.\"\n\n\"You're crazy, Nick,\" he said quickly. \"Crazy as hell. I don't know\nwhat's the matter with you.\"\n\n\"Tom,\" I inquired, \"what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?\"\n\nHe stared at me without a word and I knew I had guessed right about\nthose missing hours. I started to turn away but he took a step after me\nand grabbed my arm.\n\n\"I told him the truth,\" he said. \"He came to the door while we were\ngetting ready to leave and when I sent down word that we weren't in he\ntried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if I\nhadn't told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his\npocket every minute he was in the house----\" He broke off defiantly.\n\"What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw\ndust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy's but he was a tough\none. He ran over Myrtle like you'd run over a dog and never even stopped\nhis car.\"\n\nThere was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact\nthat it wasn't true.\n\n\"And if you think I didn't have my share of suffering--look here, when I\nwent to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting\nthere on the sideboard I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it\nwas awful----\"\n\nI couldn't forgive him or like him but I saw that what he had done was,\nto him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused.\nThey were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and\ncreatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast\ncarelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other\npeople clean up the mess they had made. . . .\n\nI shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as\nthough I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewelry store to\nbuy a pearl necklace--or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons--rid of my\nprovincial squeamishness forever.\n\n\nGatsby's house was still empty when I left--the grass on his lawn had\ngrown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village never\ntook a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and\npointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to\nEast Egg the night of the accident and perhaps he had made a story\nabout it all his own. I didn't want to hear it and I avoided him when I\ngot off the train.\n\nI spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling\nparties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the\nmusic and the laughter faint and incessant from his garden and the\ncars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a material car\nthere and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I didn't\ninvestigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the\nends of the earth and didn't know that the party was over.\n\nOn the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer,\nI went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once\nmore. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a\npiece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight and I erased it,\ndrawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the\nbeach and sprawled out on the sand.\n\nMost of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any\nlights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound.\nAnd as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away\nuntil gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered\nonce for Dutch sailors' eyes--a fresh, green breast of the new world.\nIts vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby's house, had\nonce pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams;\nfor a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the\npresence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation\nhe neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in\nhistory with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.\n\nAnd as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of\nGatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of\nDaisy's dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must\nhave seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not\nknow that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity\nbeyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under\nthe night.\n\nGatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by\nyear recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow\nwe will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine\nmorning----\n\nSo we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into\nthe past.\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nProject Gutenberg Australia",

In consequence I'm inclined to reserve all judgments,\na habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also\nmade me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind\nis quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it\nappears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I\nwas unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the\nsecret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were\nunsought--frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile\nlevity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate\nrevelation was quivering on the horizon--for the intimate revelations\nof young men or at least the terms in which they express them are\nusually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving\njudgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of\nmissing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested,\nand I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is\nparcelled out unequally at birth.\n\nAnd, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission\nthat it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet\nmarshes but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on.\nWhen I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the\nworld to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I\nwanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the\nhuman heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was\nexempt from my reaction--Gatsby who represented everything for which I\nhave an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of\nsuccessful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some\nheightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related\nto one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten\nthousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that\nflabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the\n\"creative temperament\"--it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic\nreadiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it\nis not likely I shall ever find again. No--Gatsby turned out all right\nat the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the\nwake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the\nabortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.\n\n\nMy family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle-western\ncity for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan and we\nhave a tradition that we're descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the\nactual founder of my line was my grandfather's brother who came here in\nfifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War and started the wholesale\nhardware business that my father carries on today.\n\nI never saw this great-uncle but I'm supposed to look like him--with\nspecial reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in\nFather's office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a\ncentury after my father, and a little later I participated in that\ndelayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the\ncounter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being\nthe warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like the\nragged edge of the universe--so I decided to go east and learn the bond\nbusiness. Everybody I knew was in the bond business so I supposed it\ncould support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it\nover as if they were choosing a prep-school for me and finally said,\n\"Why--ye-es\" with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance\nme for a year and after various delays I came east, permanently, I\nthought, in the spring of twenty-two.\n\nThe practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was a warm\nseason and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees,\nso when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house\ntogether in a commuting town it sounded like a great idea. He found\nthe house, a weather beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but\nat the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went out\nto the country alone. I had a dog, at least I had him for a few days\nuntil he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman who made my bed\nand cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the\nelectric stove.\n\nIt was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently\narrived than I, stopped me on the road.\n\n\"How do you get to West Egg village?\" he asked helplessly.\n\nI told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a\npathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the\nfreedom of the neighborhood.\n\nAnd so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the\ntrees--just as things grow in fast movies--I had that familiar\nconviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.\n\nThere was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health to be\npulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen\nvolumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood\non my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to\nunfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas\nknew. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides.\nI was rather literary in college--one year I wrote a series of very\nsolemn and obvious editorials for the \"Yale News\"--and now I was going\nto bring back all such things into my life and become again that most\nlimited of all specialists, the \"well-rounded man.\" This isn't just an\nepigram--life is much more successfully looked at from a single window,\nafter all.\n\nIt was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of\nthe strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender\nriotous island which extends itself due east of New York and where\nthere are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of\nland. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in\ncontour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most\ndomesticated body of salt water in the Western Hemisphere, the great\nwet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals--like the\negg in the Columbus story they are both crushed flat at the contact\nend--but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual\nconfusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more\narresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except\nshape and size.\n\nI lived at West Egg, the--well, the less fashionable of the two, though\nthis is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little\nsinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the\negg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge\nplaces that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on\nmy right was a colossal affair by any standard--it was a factual\nimitation of some H\u00f4tel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side,\nspanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool\nand more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby's mansion.\nOr rather, as I didn't know Mr. Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by\na gentleman of that name. My own house was an eye-sore, but it was a\nsmall eye-sore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the\nwater, a partial view of my neighbor's lawn, and the consoling\nproximity of millionaires--all for eighty dollars a month.\n\nAcross the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg\nglittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins\non the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom\nBuchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed and I'd known Tom\nin college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in\nChicago.\n\nHer husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of\nthe most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven--a\nnational figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute\nlimited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of\nanti-climax. His family were enormously wealthy--even in college his\nfreedom with money was a matter for reproach--but now he'd left Chicago\nand come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for\ninstance he'd brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest.\nIt was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy\nenough to do that.\n\nWhy they came east I don't know. They had spent a year in France, for no\nparticular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever\npeople played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move,\nsaid Daisy over the telephone, but I didn't believe it--I had no sight\ninto Daisy's heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking\na little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable\nfootball game.\n\nAnd so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East\nEgg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was\neven more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red and white Georgian\nColonial mansion overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach\nand ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over\nsun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens--finally when it reached\nthe house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the\nmomentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows,\nglowing now with reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy\nafternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his\nlegs apart on the front porch.\n\nHe had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy, straw haired\nman of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner.\nTwo shining, arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and\ngave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not\neven the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous\npower of that body--he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he\nstrained the top lacing and you could see a great pack of muscle\nshifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body\ncapable of enormous leverage--a cruel body.\n\nHis speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of\nfractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in\nit, even toward people he liked--and there were men at New Haven who had\nhated his guts.\n\n\"Now, don't think my opinion on these matters is final,\" he seemed to\nsay, \"just because I'm stronger and more of a man than you are.\" We\nwere in the same Senior Society, and while we were never intimate I\nalways had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like\nhim with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.\n\nWe talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.\n\n\"I've got a nice place here,\" he said, his eyes flashing about\nrestlessly.\n\nTurning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat hand along the\nfront vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half\nacre of deep pungent roses and a snub-nosed motor boat that bumped\nthe tide off shore.\n\n\"It belonged to Demaine the oil man.\" He turned me around again,\npolitely and abruptly. \"We'll go inside.\"\n\nWe walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space,\nfragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end.\nThe windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass\noutside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze\nblew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other\nlike pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of\nthe ceiling--and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a\nshadow on it as wind does on the sea.\n\nThe only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch\non which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored\nballoon. They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and\nfluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight\naround the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the\nwhip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall.\nThen there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught\nwind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two\nyoung women ballooned slowly to the floor.\n\nThe younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length\nat her end of the divan, completely motionless and with her chin raised\na little as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely\nto fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of\nit--indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having\ndisturbed her by coming in.\n\nThe other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise--she leaned slightly\nforward with a conscientious expression--then she laughed, an absurd,\ncharming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the\nroom.\n\n\"I'm p-paralyzed with happiness.\"\n\nShe laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand\nfor a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one\nin the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had.\nShe hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker.\n(I've heard it said that Daisy's murmur was only to make people\nlean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)\n\nAt any rate Miss Baker's lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost\nimperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back again--the object\nshe was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something\nof a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any\nexhibition of complete self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.\n\nI looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low,\nthrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and\ndown as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be\nplayed again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,\nbright eyes and a bright passionate mouth--but there was an excitement\nin her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget:\na singing compulsion, a whispered \"Listen,\" a promise that she had done\ngay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,\nexciting things hovering in the next hour.\n\nI told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way east\nand how a dozen people had sent their love through me.\n\n\"Do they miss me?\" she cried ecstatically.\n\n\"The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel\npainted black as a mourning wreath and there's a persistent wail all\nnight along the North Shore.\"\n\n\"How gorgeous! Let's go back, Tom. Tomorrow!\" Then she added\nirrelevantly, \"You ought to see the baby.\"\n\n\"I'd like to.\"\n\n\"She's asleep. She's two years old. Haven't you ever seen her?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Well, you ought to see her. She's----\"\n\nTom Buchanan who had been hovering restlessly about the room stopped\nand rested his hand on my shoulder.\n\n\"What you doing, Nick?\"\n\n\"I'm a bond man.\"\n\n\"Who with?\"\n\nI told him.\n\n\"Never heard of them,\" he remarked decisively.\n\nThis annoyed me.\n\n\"You will,\" I answered shortly. \"You will if you stay in the East.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll stay in the East, don't you worry,\" he said, glancing at\nDaisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more.\n\"I'd be a God Damned fool to live anywhere else.\"\n\nAt this point Miss Baker said \"Absolutely!\" with such suddenness that I\nstarted--it was the first word she uttered since I came into the room.\nEvidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and\nwith a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.\n\n\"I'm stiff,\" she complained, \"I've been lying on that sofa for as long\nas I can remember.\"\n\n\"Don't look at me,\" Daisy retorted. \"I've been trying to get you to New\nYork all afternoon.\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the\npantry, \"I'm absolutely in training.\"\n\nHer host looked at her incredulously.\n\n\"You are!\" He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of\na glass. \"How you ever get anything done is beyond me.\"\n\nI looked at Miss Baker wondering what it was she \"got done.\" I enjoyed\nlooking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect\ncarriage which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the\nshoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at\nme with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming discontented\nface. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her,\nsomewhere before.\n\n\"You live in West Egg,\" she remarked contemptuously. \"I know somebody\nthere.\"\n\n\"I don't know a single----\"\n\n\"You must know Gatsby.\"\n\n\"Gatsby?\" demanded Daisy. \"What Gatsby?\"\n\nBefore I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced;\nwedging his tense arm imperatively under mine Tom Buchanan compelled\nme from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.\n\nSlenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips the two\nyoung women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch open toward the\nsunset where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished\nwind.\n\n\"Why CANDLES?\" objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her\nfingers. \"In two weeks it'll be the longest day in the year.\"\nShe looked at us all radiantly. \"Do you always watch for the longest day\nof the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the\nyear and then miss it.\"\n\n\"We ought to plan something,\" yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the\ntable as if she were getting into bed.\n\n\"All right,\" said Daisy. \"What'll we plan?\" She turned to me helplessly.\n\"What do people plan?\"\n\nBefore I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her\nlittle finger.\n\n\"Look!\" she complained. \"I hurt it.\"\n\nWe all looked--the knuckle was black and blue.\n\n\"You did it, Tom,\" she said accusingly. \"I know you didn't mean to\nbut you DID do it. That's what I get for marrying a brute of a man,\na great big hulking physical specimen of a----\"\n\n\"I hate that word hulking,\" objected Tom crossly, \"even in kidding.\"\n\n\"Hulking,\" insisted Daisy.\n\nSometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a\nbantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool\nas their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all\ndesire. They were here--and they accepted Tom and me, making only a\npolite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew\nthat presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too\nwould be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the\nWest where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its\nclose in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer\nnervous dread of the moment itself.\n\n\"You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,\" I confessed on my second glass\nof corky but rather impressive claret. \"Can't you talk about crops or\nsomething?\"\n\nI meant nothing in particular by this remark but it was taken up in an\nunexpected way.\n\n\"Civilization's going to pieces,\" broke out Tom violently.\n\"I've gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read\n'The Rise of the Coloured Empires' by this man Goddard?\"\n\n\"Why, no,\" I answered, rather surprised by his tone.\n\n\"Well, it's a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if\nwe don't look out the white race will be--will be utterly submerged.\nIt's all scientific stuff; it's been proved.\"\n\n\"Tom's getting very profound,\" said Daisy with an expression of\nunthoughtful sadness. \"He reads deep books with long words in them.\nWhat was that word we----\"\n\n\"Well, these books are all scientific,\" insisted Tom, glancing at her\nimpatiently. \"This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up to us\nwho are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have\ncontrol of things.\"\n\n\"We've got to beat them down,\" whispered Daisy, winking ferociously\ntoward the fervent sun.\n\n\"You ought to live in California--\" began Miss Baker but Tom\ninterrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.\n\n\"This idea is that we're Nordics. I am, and you are and you are\nand----\" After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a\nslight nod and she winked at me again. \"--and we've produced all the\nthings that go to make civilization--oh, science and art and all that.\nDo you see?\"\n\nThere was something pathetic in his concentration as if his complacency,\nmore acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. When, almost\nimmediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy\nseized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.\n\n\"I'll tell you a family secret,\" she whispered enthusiastically. \"It's\nabout the butler's nose. Do you want to hear about the butler's nose?\"\n\n\"That's why I came over tonight.\"\n\n\"Well, he wasn't always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for\nsome people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people.\nHe had to polish it from morning till night until finally it began to\naffect his nose----\"\n\n\"Things went from bad to worse,\" suggested Miss Baker.\n\n\"Yes. Things went from bad to worse until finally he had to give up\nhis position.\"\n\nFor a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon\nher glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as\nI listened--then the glow faded, each light deserting her with\nlingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.\n\nThe butler came back and murmured something close to Tom's ear\nwhereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair and without a word went\ninside. As if his absence quickened something within her Daisy leaned\nforward again, her voice glowing and singing.\n\n\"I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a--of a rose, an\nabsolute rose. Doesn't he?\" She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation.\n\"An absolute rose?\"\n\nThis was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only\nextemporizing but a stirring warmth flowed from her as if her\nheart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those\nbreathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the\ntable and excused herself and went into the house.\n\nMiss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of\nmeaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said \"Sh!\" in\na warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room\nbeyond and Miss Baker leaned forward, unashamed, trying to hear. The\nmurmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted\nexcitedly, and then ceased altogether.\n\n\"This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor----\" I said.\n\n\"Don't talk. I want to hear what happens.\"\n\n\"Is something happening?\" I inquired innocently.\n\n\"You mean to say you don't know?\" said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.\n\"I thought everybody knew.\"\n\n\"I don't.\"\n\n\"Why----\" she said hesitantly, \"Tom's got some woman in New York.\"\n\n\"Got some woman?\" I repeated blankly.\n\nMiss Baker nodded.\n\n\"She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner-time. Don't\nyou think?\"\n\nAlmost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of\na dress and the crunch of leather boots and Tom and Daisy were back\nat the table.\n\n\"It couldn't be helped!\" cried Daisy with tense gayety.\n\nShe sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me and\ncontinued: \"I looked outdoors for a minute and it's very romantic\noutdoors. There's a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale\ncome over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He's singing away----\" her\nvoice sang \"----It's romantic, isn't it, Tom?\"\n\n\"Very romantic,\" he said, and then miserably to me: \"If it's light enough\nafter dinner I want to take you down to the stables.\"\n\nThe telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her\nhead decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all\nsubjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the\nlast five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again,\npointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every\none and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn't guess what Daisy and Tom\nwere thinking but I doubt if even Miss Baker who seemed to have\nmastered a certain hardy skepticism was able utterly to put this fifth\nguest's shrill metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament\nthe situation might have seemed intriguing--my own instinct was to\ntelephone immediately for the police.\n\nThe horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss\nBaker, with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into\nthe library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while\ntrying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf I followed\nDaisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In\nits deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.\n\nDaisy took her face in her hands, as if feeling its lovely shape, and\nher eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent\nemotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some\nsedative questions about her little girl.\n\n\"We don't know each other very well, Nick,\" she said suddenly.\n\"Even if we are cousins. You didn't come to my wedding.\"\n\n\"I wasn't back from the war.\"\n\n\"That's true.\" She hesitated. \"Well, I've had a very bad time, Nick,\nand I'm pretty cynical about everything.\"\n\nEvidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn't say any more,\nand after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her\ndaughter.\n\n\"I suppose she talks, and--eats, and everything.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\" She looked at me absently. \"Listen, Nick; let me tell you what\nI said when she was born. Would you like to hear?\"\n\n\"Very much.\"\n\n\"It'll show you how I've gotten to feel about--things. Well, she was less\nthan an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether\nwith an utterly abandoned feeling and asked the nurse right away if it\nwas a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head\naway and wept. 'All right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope\nshe'll be a fool--that's the best thing a girl can be in this world,\na beautiful little fool.\"\n\n\"You see I think everything's terrible anyhow,\" she went on in a\nconvinced way. \"Everybody thinks so--the most advanced people. And I KNOW.\nI've been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.\"\nHer eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom's, and she\nlaughed with thrilling scorn. \"Sophisticated--God, I'm sophisticated!\"\n\nThe instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention,\nmy belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said.\nIt made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick\nof some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited,\nand sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk\non her lovely face as if she had asserted her membership in a rather\ndistinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.\n\n\nInside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker\nsat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from\nthe \"Saturday Evening Post\"--the words, murmurous and\nuninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamp-light,\nbright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair,\nglinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender\nmuscles in her arms.\n\nWhen we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.\n\n\"To be continued,\" she said, tossing the magazine on the table, \"in our\nvery next issue.\"\n\nHer body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she\nstood up.\n\n\"Ten o'clock,\" she remarked, apparently finding the time on the\nceiling. \"Time for this good girl to go to bed.\"\n\n\"Jordan's going to play in the tournament tomorrow,\" explained Daisy,\n\"over at Westchester.\"\n\n\"Oh,--you're JORdan Baker.\"\n\nI knew now why her face was familiar--its pleasing contemptuous\nexpression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of\nthe sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I\nhad heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story,\nbut what it was I had forgotten long ago.\n\n\"Good night,\" she said softly. \"Wake me at eight, won't you.\"\n\n\"If you'll get up.\"\n\n\"I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.\"\n\n\"Of course you will,\" confirmed Daisy. \"In fact I think I'll arrange\na marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I'll sort of--oh--fling you\ntogether. You know--lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push\nyou out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing----\"\n\n\"Good night,\" called Miss Baker from the stairs. \"I haven't heard a word.\"\n\n\"She's a nice girl,\" said Tom after a moment. \"They oughtn't to let her\nrun around the country this way.\"\n\n\"Who oughtn't to?\" inquired Daisy coldly.\n\n\"Her family.\"\n\n\"Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick's\ngoing to look after her, aren't you, Nick? She's going to spend lots of\nweek-ends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very\ngood for her.\"\n\nDaisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.\n\n\"Is she from New York?\" I asked quickly.\n\n\"From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our\nbeautiful white----\"\n\n\"Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?\"\ndemanded Tom suddenly.\n\n\"Did I?\" She looked at me. \"I can't seem to remember, but I think\nwe talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I'm sure we did. It sort of\ncrept up on us and first thing you know----\"\n\n\"Don't believe everything you hear, Nick,\" he advised me.\n\nI said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later\nI got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood side by\nside in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor Daisy\nperemptorily called \"Wait!\n\n\"I forgot to ask you something, and it's important. We heard you were\nengaged to a girl out West.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" corroborated Tom kindly. \"We heard that you were\nengaged.\"\n\n\"It's libel. I'm too poor.\"\n\n\"But we heard it,\" insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in\na flower-like way. \"We heard it from three people so it must be true.\"\n\nOf course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn't even vaguely\nengaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the\nreasons I had come east. You can't stop going with an old friend on\naccount of rumors and on the other hand I had no intention of being\nrumored into marriage.\n\nTheir interest rather touched me and made them less remotely\nrich--nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove\naway. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of\nthe house, child in arms--but apparently there were no such intentions\nin her head. As for Tom, the fact that he \"had some woman in New York\"\nwas really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book.\nSomething was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his\nsturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.\n\nAlready it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside\ngarages, where new red gas-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I\nreached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for\na while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown\noff, leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees and\na persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the\nfrogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the\nmoonlight and turning my head to watch it I saw that I was not\nalone--fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my\nneighbor's mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets\nregarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely\nmovements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested\nthat it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was\nhis of our local heavens.\n\nI decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and\nthat would do for an introduction. But I didn't call to him for he gave\na sudden intimation that he was content to be alone--he stretched out his\narms toward the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him\nI could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward--and\ndistinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away,\nthat might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby\nhe had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n\n\nAbout half way between West Egg and New York the motor-road hastily\njoins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to\nshrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of\nashes--a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and\nhills and grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and\nchimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcendent effort, of\nmen who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.\nOccasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives\nout a ghastly creak and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey\nmen swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud\nwhich screens their obscure operations from your sight.\n\nBut above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift\nendlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T.\nJ. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and\ngigantic--their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face but,\ninstead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a\nnonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to\nfatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself\ninto eternal blindness or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes,\ndimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain, brood on over\nthe solemn dumping ground.\n\nThe valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and\nwhen the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on\nwaiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an\nhour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute and it was\nbecause of this that I first met Tom Buchanan's mistress.\n\nThe fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. His\nacquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular\nrestaurants with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about,\nchatting with whomsoever he knew. Though I was curious to see her I\nhad no desire to meet her--but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on\nthe train one afternoon and when we stopped by the ashheaps he jumped\nto his feet and taking hold of my elbow literally forced me from the\ncar.\n\n\"We're getting off!\" he insisted. \"I want you to meet my girl.\"\n\nI think he'd tanked up a good deal at luncheon and his determination to\nhave my company bordered on violence. The supercilious assumption was that\non Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.\n\nI followed him over a low white-washed railroad fence and we walked\nback a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg's persistent\nstare. The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick\nsitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street\nministering to it and contiguous to absolutely nothing. One of the\nthree shops it contained was for rent and another was an all-night\nrestaurant approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a\ngarage--Repairs. GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars Bought and Sold--and I followed\nTom inside.\n\nThe interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the\ndust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had\noccurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind and that\nsumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead when the\nproprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands\non a piece of waste. He was a blonde, spiritless man, anaemic, and\nfaintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his\nlight blue eyes.\n\n\"Hello, Wilson, old man,\" said Tom, slapping him jovially on the\nshoulder. \"How's business?\"\n\n\"I can't complain,\" answered Wilson unconvincingly. \"When are you going\nto sell me that car?\"\n\n\"Next week; I've got my man working on it now.\"\n\n\"Works pretty slow, don't he?\"\n\n\"No, he doesn't,\" said Tom coldly. \"And if you feel that way about it,\nmaybe I'd better sell it somewhere else after all.\"\n\n\"I don't mean that,\" explained Wilson quickly. \"I just meant----\"\n\nHis voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage. Then\nI heard footsteps on a stairs and in a moment the thickish figure of a\nwoman blocked out the light from the office door. She was in the middle\nthirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously\nas some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue\ncrepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty but there was an\nimmediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body\nwere continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and walking through her\nhusband as if he were a ghost shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in\nthe eye. Then she wet her lips and without turning around spoke to her\nhusband in a soft, coarse voice:\n\n\"Get some chairs, why don't you, so somebody can sit down.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" agreed Wilson hurriedly and went toward the little office,\nmingling immediately with the cement color of the walls. A white ashen\ndust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in\nthe vicinity--except his wife, who moved close to Tom.\n\n\"I want to see you,\" said Tom intently. \"Get on the next train.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\n\"I'll meet you by the news-stand on the lower level.\"\n\nShe nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson\nemerged with two chairs from his office door.\n\nWe waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days before\nthe Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting\ntorpedoes in a row along the railroad track.\n\n\"Terrible place, isn't it,\" said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor\nEckleburg.\n\n\"Awful.\"\n\n\"It does her good to get away.\"\n\n\"Doesn't her husband object?\"\n\n\"Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He's so dumb\nhe doesn't know he's alive.\"\n\nSo Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York--or not\nquite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom\ndeferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be\non the train.\n\nShe had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin which stretched\ntight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in\nNew York. At the news-stand she bought a copy of \"Town Tattle\" and a\nmoving-picture magazine and, in the station drug store, some cold cream\nand a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive\nshe let four taxi cabs drive away before she selected a new one,\nlavender-colored with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the\nmass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she\nturned sharply from the window and leaning forward tapped on the\nfront glass.\n\n\"I want to get one of those dogs,\" she said earnestly. \"I want to get one\nfor the apartment. They're nice to have--a dog.\"\n\nWe backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John\nD. Rockefeller. In a basket, swung from his neck, cowered a dozen very\nrecent puppies of an indeterminate breed.\n\n\"What kind are they?\" asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly as he came to the\ntaxi-window.\n\n\"All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?\"\n\n\"I'd like to get one of those police dogs; I don't suppose you got that\nkind?\"\n\nThe man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew\none up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.\n\n\"That's no police dog,\" said Tom.\n\n\"No, it's not exactly a polICE dog,\" said the man with disappointment\nin his voice. \"It's more of an airedale.\" He passed his hand over the\nbrown wash-rag of a back. \"Look at that coat. Some coat. That's a dog\nthat'll never bother you with catching cold.\"\n\n\"I think it's cute,\" said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. \"How much is it?\"\n\n\"That dog?\" He looked at it admiringly. \"That dog will cost you ten\ndollars.\"\n\nThe airedale--undoubtedly there was an airedale concerned in it somewhere\nthough its feet were startlingly white--changed hands and settled down\ninto Mrs. Wilson's lap, where she fondled the weather-proof coat with\nrapture.\n\n\"Is it a boy or a girl?\" she asked delicately.\n\n\"That dog? That dog's a boy.\"\n\n\"It's a bitch,\" said Tom decisively. \"Here's your money. Go and buy ten\nmore dogs with it.\"\n\nWe drove over to Fifth Avenue, so warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the\nsummer Sunday afternoon that I wouldn't have been surprised to see a great\nflock of white sheep turn the corner.\n\n\"Hold on,\" I said, \"I have to leave you here.\"\n\n\"No, you don't,\" interposed Tom quickly. \"Myrtle'll be hurt if you don't \ncome up to the apartment. Won't you,\nMyrtle?\"\n\n\"Come on,\" she urged. \"I'll telephone my sister Catherine. She's said to\nbe very beautiful by people who ought to know.\"\n\n\"Well, I'd like to, but----\"\n\nWe went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds.\nAt 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of\napartment houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the\nneighborhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases\nand went haughtily in.\n\n\"I'm going to have the McKees come up,\" she announced as we rose in the\nelevator. \"And of course I got to call up my sister, too.\"\n\nThe apartment was on the top floor--a small living room, a small\ndining room, a small bedroom and a bath. The living room was crowded to\nthe doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it\nso that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of\nladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was\nan over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred\nrock. Looked at from a distance however the hen resolved itself\ninto a bonnet and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down\ninto the room. Several old copies of \"Town Tattle \"lay on the table\ntogether with a copy of \"Simon Called Peter\" and some of the small\nscandal magazines of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with\nthe dog. A reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and\nsome milk to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large\nhard dog biscuits--one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer\nof milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whiskey\nfrom a locked bureau door.\n\nI have been drunk just twice in my life and the second time was that\nafternoon so everything that happened has a dim hazy cast over it\nalthough until after eight o'clock the apartment was full of cheerful\nsun. Sitting on Tom's lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the\ntelephone; then there were no cigarettes and I went out to buy some at\nthe drug store on the corner. When I came back they had disappeared so\nI sat down discreetly in the living room and read a chapter of \"Simon\nCalled Peter\"--either it was terrible stuff or the whiskey distorted\nthings because it didn't make any sense to me.\n\nJust as Tom and Myrtle--after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called\neach other by our first names--reappeared, company commenced to arrive\nat the apartment door.\n\nThe sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty\nwith a solid sticky bob of red hair and a complexion powdered milky\nwhite. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more\nrakish angle but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the\nold alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about\nthere was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets\njingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary\nhaste and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered\nif she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated\nmy question aloud and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel.\n\nMr. McKee was a pale feminine man from the flat below. He had just\nshaved for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone and he\nwas most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He\ninformed me that he was in the \"artistic game\" and I gathered later\nthat he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs.\nWilson's mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His wife\nwas shrill, languid, handsome and horrible. She told me with pride\nthat her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven times\nsince they had been married.\n\nMrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before and was now\nattired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream colored chiffon, which\ngave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room.\nWith the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a\nchange. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage\nwas converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her\nassertions became more violently affected moment by moment and as she\nexpanded the room grew smaller around her until she seemed to be\nrevolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.\n\n\"My dear,\" she told her sister in a high mincing shout, \"most of these\nfellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I had a\nwoman up here last week to look at my feet and when she gave me the\nbill you'd of thought she had my appendicitus out.\"\n\n\"What was the name of the woman?\" asked Mrs. McKee.\n\n\"Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people's feet in their own\nhomes.\"\n\n\"I like your dress,\" remarked Mrs. McKee, \"I think it's adorable.\"\n\nMrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.\n\n\"It's just a crazy old thing,\" she said. \"I just slip it on sometimes when\nI don't care what I look like.\"\n\n\"But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,\" pursued\nMrs. McKee. \"If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could\nmake something of it.\"\n\nWe all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson who removed a strand of hair from\nover her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee\nregarded her intently with his head on one side and then moved his hand\nback and forth slowly in front of his face.\n\n\"I should change the light,\" he said after a moment. \"I'd like to bring\nout the modelling of the features. And I'd try to get hold of all the\nback hair.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't think of changing the light,\" cried Mrs. McKee. \"I think\nit's----\"\n\nHer husband said \"SH!\" and we all looked at the subject again whereupon\nTom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.\n\n\"You McKees have something to drink,\" he said. \"Get some more ice and\nmineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.\"\n\n\"I told that boy about the ice.\" Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair\nat the shiftlessness of the lower orders. \"These people! You have to keep\nafter them all the time.\"\n\nShe looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the\ndog, kissed it with ecstasy and swept into the kitchen, implying that\na dozen chefs awaited her orders there.\n\n\"I've done some nice things out on Long Island,\" asserted Mr. McKee.\n\nTom looked at him blankly.\n\n\"Two of them we have framed downstairs.\"\n\n\"Two what?\" demanded Tom.\n\n\"Two studies. One of them I call 'Montauk Point--the Gulls,' and the\nother I call 'Montauk Point--the Sea.' \"\n\nThe sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.\n\n\"Do you live down on Long Island, too?\" she inquired.\n\n\"I live at West Egg.\"\n\n\"Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named\nGatsby's. Do you know him?\"\n\n\"I live next door to him.\"\n\n\"Well, they say he's a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm's. That's\nwhere all his money comes from.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"I'm scared of him. I'd hate to have him get anything on me.\"\n\nThis absorbing information about my neighbor was interrupted by\nMrs. McKee's pointing suddenly at Catherine:\n\n\"Chester, I think you could do something with HER,\" she broke out,\nbut Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way and turned his attention\nto Tom.\n\n\"I'd like to do more work on Long Island if I could get the entry. All\nI ask is that they should give me a start.\"\n\n\"Ask Myrtle,\" said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as\nMrs. Wilson entered with a tray. \"She'll give you a letter of\nintroduction, won't you, Myrtle?\"\n\n\"Do what?\" she asked, startled.\n\n\"You'll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can\ndo some studies of him.\" His lips moved silently for a moment as he\ninvented. \" 'George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,' or something like\nthat.\"\n\n\nCatherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear: \"Neither of them\ncan stand the person they're married to.\"\n\n\"Can't they?\"\n\n\"Can't STAND them.\" She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. \"What I say is,\nwhy go on living with them if they can't stand them? If I was them I'd get\na divorce and get married to each other right away.\"\n\n\"Doesn't she like Wilson either?\"\n\nThe answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle who had overheard\nthe question and it was violent and obscene.\n\n\"You see?\" cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again.\n\"It's really his wife that's keeping them apart. She's a Catholic and\nthey don't believe in divorce.\"\n\nDaisy was not a Catholic and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness\nof the lie.\n\n\"When they do get married,\" continued Catherine, \"they're going west to\nlive for a while until it blows over.\"\n\n\"It'd be more discreet to go to Europe.\"\n\n\"Oh, do you like Europe?\" she exclaimed surprisingly. \"I just got back\nfrom Monte Carlo.\"\n\n\"Really.\"\n\n\"Just last year. I went over there with another girl.\"\n\n\"Stay long?\"\n\n\"No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way of Marseilles.\nWe had over twelve hundred dollars when we started but we got gypped\nout of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had an awful time\ngetting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town!\"\n\nThe late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue\nhoney of the Mediterranean--then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me\nback into the room.\n\n\"I almost made a mistake, too,\" she declared vigorously. \"I almost\nmarried a little kyke who'd been after me for years. I knew he was\nbelow me. Everybody kept saying to me: 'Lucille, that man's way below\nyou!' But if I hadn't met Chester, he'd of got me sure.\"\n\n\"Yes, but listen,\" said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down,\n\"at least you didn't marry him.\"\n\n\"I know I didn't.\"\n\n\"Well, I married him,\" said Myrtle, ambiguously. \"And that's the\ndifference between your case and mine.\"\n\n\"Why did you, Myrtle?\" demanded Catherine. \"Nobody forced you to.\"\n\nMyrtle considered.\n\n\"I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,\" she said finally.\n\"I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn't fit to lick\nmy shoe.\"\n\n\"You were crazy about him for a while,\" said Catherine.\n\n\"Crazy about him!\" cried Myrtle incredulously. \"Who said I was crazy about\nhim? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man\nthere.\"\n\nShe pointed suddenly at me, and every one looked at me accusingly.\nI tried to show by my expression that I had played no part in her past.\n\n\"The only CRAZY I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made a\nmistake. He borrowed somebody's best suit to get married in and never\neven told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he was out.\nShe looked around to see who was listening: \" 'Oh, is that your suit?' I \nsaid.\n'This is the first I ever heard about it.' But I gave it to him and then I \nlay down\nand cried to beat the band all afternoon.\"\n\n\"She really ought to get away from him,\" resumed Catherine to me.\n\"They've been living over that garage for eleven years. And Tom's the\nfirst sweetie she ever had.\"\n\nThe bottle of whiskey--a second one--was now in constant demand by all\npresent, excepting Catherine who \"felt just as good on nothing at all.\"\nTom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches,\nwhich were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted to get out and walk\neastward toward the park through the soft twilight but each time I tried\nto go I became entangled in some wild strident argument which pulled me\nback, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city our line of\nyellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the\ncasual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and\nwondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled\nby the inexhaustible variety of life.\n\nMyrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath\npoured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.\n\n\"It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the\nlast ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my\nsister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather\nshoes and I couldn't keep my eyes off him but every time he looked at\nme I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head.\nWhen we came into the station he was next to me and his white\nshirt-front pressed against my arm--and so I told him I'd have to call\na policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into\na taxi with him I didn't hardly know I wasn't getting into a subway\ntrain. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was 'You can't live\nforever, you can't live forever.' \"\n\nShe turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial\nlaughter.\n\n\"My dear,\" she cried, \"I'm going to give you this dress as soon as I'm\nthrough with it. I've got to get another one tomorrow. I'm going to\nmake a list of all the things I've got to get. A massage and a wave\nand a collar for the dog and one of those cute little ash-trays where\nyou touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother's\ngrave that'll last all summer. I got to write down a list so I won't\nforget all the things I got to do.\"\n\nIt was nine o'clock--almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch\nand found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists\nclenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out my\nhandkerchief I wiped from his cheek the remains of the spot of dried\nlather that had worried me all the afternoon.\n\nThe little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through\nthe smoke and from time to time groaning faintly. People disappeared,\nreappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other,\nsearched for each other, found each other a few feet away. Some time\ntoward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face\ndiscussing in impassioned voices whether Mrs. Wilson had any right to\nmention Daisy's name.\n\n\"Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!\" shouted Mrs. Wilson. \"I'll say it whenever I want\nto! Daisy! Dai----\"\n\nMaking a short deft movement Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his\nopen hand.\n\nThen there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women's\nvoices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of\npain. Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the door.\nWhen he had gone half way he turned around and stared at the scene--his\nwife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and\nthere among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and the\ndespairing figure on the couch bleeding fluently and trying to spread\na copy of \"Town Tattle\" over the tapestry scenes of Versailles.\nThen Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the door. Taking my hat from\nthe chandelier I followed.\n\n\"Come to lunch some day,\" he suggested, as we groaned down in the\nelevator.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Anywhere.\"\n\n\"Keep your hands off the lever,\" snapped the elevator boy.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. McKee with dignity, \"I didn't know I was\ntouching it.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I agreed, \"I'll be glad to.\"\n\n. . . I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the\nsheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.\n\n\"Beauty and the Beast . . . Loneliness . . . Old Grocery Horse . . .\nBrook'n Bridge . . . .\"\n\nThen I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the Pennsylvania\nStation, staring at the morning \"Tribune\" and waiting for the four\no'clock train.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n\n\nThere was music from my neighbor's house through the summer nights. In\nhis blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the\nwhisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the\nafternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft or\ntaking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats\nslit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of\nfoam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties\nto and from the city, between nine in the morning and long past\nmidnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to\nmeet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants including an extra\ngardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers\nand garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.\n\nEvery Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer\nin New York--every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back\ndoor in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the\nkitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an\nhour, if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler's\nthumb.\n\nAt least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several\nhundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas\ntree of Gatsby's enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with\nglistening hors-d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of\nharlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold.\nIn the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked\nwith gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of\nhis female guests were too young to know one from another.\n\nBy seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived--no thin five-piece affair\nbut a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and\ncornets and piccolos and low and high drums. The last swimmers have\ncome in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from\nNew York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and\nsalons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors and hair shorn in\nstrange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The\nbar is in full swing and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the\ngarden outside until the air is alive with chatter and laughter and\ncasual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and\nenthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names.\n\nThe lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and\nnow the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music and the opera of\nvoices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier, minute by minute,\nspilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups\nchange more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the\nsame breath--already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave\nhere and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp,\njoyous moment the center of a group and then excited with triumph\nglide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the\nconstantly changing light.\n\nSuddenly one of these gypsies in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out\nof the air, dumps it down for courage and moving her hands like\nFrisco dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; the\norchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her and there is a\nburst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda\nGray's understudy from the \"Follies.\" The party has begun.\n\nI believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby's house I was one of\nthe few guests who had actually been invited. People were not\ninvited--they went there. They got into automobiles which bore them out\nto Long Island and somehow they ended up at Gatsby's door. Once there\nthey were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby and after that they\nconducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with\namusement parks. Sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby\nat all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own\nticket of admission.\n\nI had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of robin's egg\nblue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly\nformal note from his employer--the honor would be entirely Gatsby's, it\nsaid, if I would attend his \"little party\" that night. He had\nseen me several times and had intended to call on me long before\nbut a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it--signed\nJay Gatsby in a majestic hand.\n\nDressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after\nseven and wandered around rather ill-at-ease among swirls and eddies\nof people I didn't know--though here and there was a face I had noticed\non the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number of young\nEnglishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry\nand all talking in low earnest voices to solid and prosperous\nAmericans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or\ninsurance or automobiles. They were, at least, agonizingly aware of the\neasy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few\nwords in the right key.\n\nAs soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host but the two or\nthree people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an\namazed way and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements\nthat I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table--the only place\nin the garden where a single man could linger without looking\npurposeless and alone.\n\nI was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when\nJordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble\nsteps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest\ndown into the garden.\n\nWelcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone\nbefore I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passers-by.\n\n\"Hello!\" I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturally\nloud across the garden.\n\n\"I thought you might be here,\" she responded absently as I came up.\n\"I remembered you lived next door to----\"\n\nShe held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she'd take care\nof me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses\nwho stopped at the foot of the steps.\n\n\"Hello!\" they cried together. \"Sorry you didn't win.\"\n\nThat was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week\nbefore.\n\n\"You don't know who we are,\" said one of the girls in yellow, \"but we\nmet you here about a month ago.\"\n\n\"You've dyed your hair since then,\" remarked Jordan, and I started\nbut the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the\npremature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer's\nbasket. With Jordan's slender golden arm resting in mine we descended\nthe steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated at\nus through the twilight and we sat down at a table with the two girls in\nyellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble.\n\n\"Do you come to these parties often?\" inquired Jordan of the girl\nbeside her.\n\n\"The last one was the one I met you at,\" answered the girl, in an alert,\nconfident voice. She turned to her companion: \"Wasn't it for you,\nLucille?\"\n\nIt was for Lucille, too.\n\n\"I like to come,\" Lucille said. \"I never care what I do, so I always have\na good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked\nme my name and address--inside of a week I got a package from Croirier's\nwith a new evening gown in it.\"\n\n\"Did you keep it?\" asked Jordan.\n\n\"Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the\nbust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two\nhundred and sixty-five dollars.\"\n\n\"There's something funny about a fellow that'll do a thing like that,\"\nsaid the other girl eagerly. \"He doesn't want any trouble with ANYbody.\"\n\n\"Who doesn't?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Gatsby. Somebody told me----\"\n\nThe two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.\n\n\"Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.\"\n\nA thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and\nlistened eagerly.\n\n\"I don't think it's so much THAT,\" argued Lucille skeptically; \"it's\nmore that he was a German spy during the war.\"\n\nOne of the men nodded in confirmation.\n\n\"I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in\nGermany,\" he assured us positively.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said the first girl, \"it couldn't be that, because he was in\nthe American army during the war.\" As our credulity switched back to\nher she leaned forward with enthusiasm. \"You look at him sometimes when\nhe thinks nobody's looking at him. I'll bet he killed a man.\"\n\nShe narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned and\nlooked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic speculation he\ninspired that there were whispers about him from those who found little\nthat it was necessary to whisper about in this world.\n\nThe first supper--there would be another one after midnight--was now\nbeing served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party who were\nspread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were\nthree married couples and Jordan's escort, a persistent undergraduate\ngiven to violent innuendo and obviously under the impression\nthat sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person\nto a greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling this party\nhad preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the\nfunction of representing the staid nobility of the countryside--East\nEgg condescending to West Egg, and carefully on guard against its\nspectroscopic gayety.\n\n\"Let's get out,\" whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and\ninappropriate half hour. \"This is much too polite for me.\"\n\nWe got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host--I\nhad never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The\nundergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.\n\nThe bar, where we glanced first, was crowded but Gatsby was not there.\nShe couldn't find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn't on the\nveranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked\ninto a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and\nprobably transported complete from some ruin overseas.\n\nA stout, middle-aged man with enormous owl-eyed spectacles was\nsitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with\nunsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he\nwheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.\n\n\"What do you think?\" he demanded impetuously.\n\n\"About what?\"\n\nHe waved his hand toward the book-shelves.\n\n\"About that. As a matter of fact you needn't bother to ascertain. I\nascertained. They're real.\"\n\n\"The books?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Absolutely real--have pages and everything. I thought they'd be a nice\ndurable cardboard. Matter of fact, they're absolutely real. Pages\nand--Here! Lemme show you.\"\n\nTaking our skepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and\nreturned with Volume One of the \"Stoddard Lectures.\"\n\n\"See!\" he cried triumphantly. \"It's a bona fide piece of printed matter.\nIt fooled me. This fella's a regular Belasco. It's a triumph. What\nthoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop too--didn't cut the pages.\nBut what do you want? What do you expect?\"\n\nHe snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf\nmuttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable\nto collapse.\n\n\"Who brought you?\" he demanded. \"Or did you just come? I was brought.\nMost people were brought.\"\n\nJordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully without answering.\n\n\"I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,\" he continued. \"Mrs. Claud\nRoosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I've\nbeen drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me\nup to sit in a library.\"\n\n\"Has it?\"\n\n\"A little bit, I think. I can't tell yet. I've only been here\nan hour. Did I tell you about the books? They're real. They're----\"\n\n\"You told us.\"\n\nWe shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.\n\nThere was dancing now on the canvas in the garden, old men pushing\nyoung girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples\nholding each other tortuously, fashionably and keeping in the\ncorners--and a great number of single girls dancing individualistically\nor relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or\nthe traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had\nsung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz and between\nthe numbers people were doing \"stunts\" all over the garden, while happy\nvacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage\n\"twins\"--who turned out to be the girls in yellow--did a baby act in\ncostume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger bowls.\nThe moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of\nsilver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the\nbanjoes on the lawn.\n\nI was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of\nabout my age and a rowdy little girl who gave way upon the slightest\nprovocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now. I\nhad taken two finger bowls of champagne and the scene had changed\nbefore my eyes into something significant, elemental and profound.\n\nAt a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.\n\n\"Your face is familiar,\" he said, politely. \"Weren't you in the Third\nDivision during the war?\"\n\n\"Why, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-Gun Battalion.\"\n\n\"I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I'd\nseen you somewhere before.\"\n\nWe talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France.\nEvidently he lived in this vicinity for he told me that he had just\nbought a hydroplane and was going to try it out in the morning.\n\n\"Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.\"\n\n\"What time?\"\n\n\"Any time that suits you best.\"\n\nIt was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around\nand smiled.\n\n\"Having a gay time now?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Much better.\" I turned again to my new acquaintance. \"This is an unusual\nparty for me. I haven't even seen the host. I live over there----\" I waved\nmy hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, \"and this man Gatsby sent\nover his chauffeur with an invitation.\"\n\nFor a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.\n\n\"I'm Gatsby,\" he said suddenly.\n\n\"What!\" I exclaimed. \"Oh, I beg your pardon.\"\n\n\"I thought you knew, old sport. I'm afraid I'm not a very good host.\"\n\nHe smiled understandingly--much more than understandingly. It was\none of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance\nin it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or\nseemed to face--the whole external world for an instant, and then\nconcentrated on YOU with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It\nunderstood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in\nyou as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it\nhad precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to\nconvey. Precisely at that point it vanished--and I was looking at an\nelegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate\nformality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he\nintroduced himself I'd got a strong impression that he was picking his\nwords with care.\n\nAlmost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler\nhurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on\nthe wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us\nin turn.\n\n\"If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,\" he urged me.\n\"Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.\"\n\nWhen he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan--constrained to assure her\nof my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and\ncorpulent person in his middle years.\n\n\"Who is he?\" I demanded. \"Do you know?\"\n\n\"He's just a man named Gatsby.\"\n\n\"Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?\"\n\n\"Now YOU're started on the subject,\" she answered with a wan smile.\n\"Well,--he told me once he was an Oxford man.\"\n\nA dim background started to take shape behind him but at her\nnext remark it faded away.\n\n\"However, I don't believe it.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she insisted, \"I just don't think he went there.\"\n\nSomething in her tone reminded me of the other girl's \"I think\nhe killed a man,\" and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I\nwould have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang\nfrom the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York.\nThat was comprehensible. But young men didn't--at least in my provincial\ninexperience I believed they didn't--drift coolly out of nowhere and buy\na palace on Long Island Sound.\n\n\"Anyhow he gives large parties,\" said Jordan, changing the subject\nwith an urbane distaste for the concrete. \"And I like large parties.\nThey're so intimate. At small parties there isn't any privacy.\"\n\nThere was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader\nrang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he cried. \"At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are\ngoing to play for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff's latest work which attracted\nso much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers\nyou know there was a big sensation.\" He smiled with jovial condescension\nand added \"Some sensation!\" whereupon everybody laughed.\n\n\"The piece is known,\" he concluded lustily, \"as 'Vladimir Tostoff's\nJazz History of the World.' \"\n\nThe nature of Mr. Tostoff's composition eluded me, because just as\nit began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps\nand looking from one group to another with approving eyes.\nHis tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and\nhis short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day. I could\nsee nothing sinister about him. I wondered if the fact that he was\nnot drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed\nto me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased.\nWhen the \"Jazz History of the World\" was over girls were putting\ntheir heads on men's shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were\nswooning backward playfully into men's arms, even into groups knowing\nthat some one would arrest their falls--but no one swooned backward on\nGatsby and no French bob touched Gatsby's shoulder and no singing\nquartets were formed with Gatsby's head for one link.\n\n\"I beg your pardon.\"\n\nGatsby's butler was suddenly standing beside us.\n\n\"Miss Baker?\" he inquired. \"I beg your pardon but Mr. Gatsby would like\nto speak to you alone.\"\n\n\"With me?\" she exclaimed in surprise.\n\n\"Yes, madame.\"\n\nShe got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment,\nand followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore\nher evening dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes--there\nwas a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to\nwalk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.\n\nI was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and\nintriguing sounds had issued from a long many-windowed room which\noverhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan's undergraduate who was now\nengaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who\nimplored me to join him, I went inside.\n\nThe large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was\nplaying the piano and beside her stood a tall, red haired young lady\nfrom a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of\nchampagne and during the course of her song she had decided ineptly\nthat everything was very very sad--she was not only singing, she was\nweeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with\ngasping broken sobs and then took up the lyric again in a quavering\nsoprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks--not freely, however, for when\nthey came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an\ninky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. A\nhumorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face\nwhereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair and went off into\na deep vinous sleep.\n\n\"She had a fight with a man who says he's her husband,\" explained a\ngirl at my elbow.\n\nI looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights\nwith men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan's party, the quartet\nfrom East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was\ntalking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife after\nattempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent\nway broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks--at intervals she\nappeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed \"You\npromised!\" into his ear.\n\nThe reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall was at\npresent occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant\nwives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised\nvoices.\n\n\"Whenever he sees I'm having a good time he wants to go home.\"\n\n\"Never heard anything so selfish in my life.\"\n\n\"We're always the first ones to leave.\"\n\n\"So are we.\"\n\n\"Well, we're almost the last tonight,\" said one of the men sheepishly.\n\"The orchestra left half an hour ago.\"\n\nIn spite of the wives' agreement that such malevolence was beyond\ncredibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were\nlifted kicking into the night.\n\nAs I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and\nJordan Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last word\nto her but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into\nformality as several people approached him to say goodbye.\n\nJordan's party were calling impatiently to her from the porch but she\nlingered for a moment to shake hands.\n\n\"I've just heard the most amazing thing,\" she whispered. \"How long were\nwe in there?\"\n\n\"Why,--about an hour.\"\n\n\"It was--simply amazing,\" she repeated abstractedly. \"But I swore\nI wouldn't tell it and here I am tantalizing you.\" She yawned\ngracefully in my face. \"Please come and see me. . . . Phone book.\n. . . Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard. . . . My aunt. . . .\"\nShe was hurrying off as she talked--her brown hand waved a\njaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door.\n\nRather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I\njoined the last of Gatsby's guests who were clustered around him. I\nwanted to explain that I'd hunted for him early in the evening and to\napologize for not having known him in the garden.\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" he enjoined me eagerly. \"Don't give it another\nthought, old sport.\" The familiar expression held no more familiarity\nthan the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. \"And don't forget\nwe're going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning at nine o'clock.\"\n\nThen the butler, behind his shoulder:\n\n\"Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.\"\n\n\"All right, in a minute. Tell them I'll be right there. . . . good\nnight.\"\n\n\"Good night.\"\n\n\"Good night.\" He smiled--and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant\nsignificance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired\nit all the time. \"Good night, old sport. . . . Good night.\"\n\nBut as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over.\nFifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and\ntumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side up but\nviolently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coup\u00e9 which had left Gatsby's\ndrive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the\ndetachment of the wheel which was now getting considerable attention from\nhalf a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as they had left their cars\nblocking the road a harsh discordant din from those in the rear had been\naudible for some time and added to the already violent confusion of\nthe scene.\n\nA man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in\nthe middle of the road, looking from the car to the tire and from the\ntire to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.\n\n\"See!\" he explained. \"It went in the ditch.\"\n\nThe fact was infinitely astonishing to him--and I recognized first the\nunusual quality of wonder and then the man--it was the late patron of\nGatsby's library.\n\n\"How'd it happen?\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I know nothing whatever about mechanics,\" he said decisively.\n\n\"But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?\"\n\n\"Don't ask me,\" said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter.\n\"I know very little about driving--next to nothing. It happened,\nand that's all I know.\"\n\n\"Well, if you're a poor driver you oughtn't to try driving at night.\"\n\n\"But I wasn't even trying,\" he explained indignantly, \"I wasn't even\ntrying.\"\n\nAn awed hush fell upon the bystanders.\n\n\"Do you want to commit suicide?\"\n\n\"You're lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even TRYing!\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" explained the criminal. \"I wasn't driving. There's\nanother man in the car.\"\n\nThe shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained\n\"Ah-h-h!\" as the door of the coup\u00e9 swung slowly open. The crowd--it was\nnow a crowd--stepped back involuntarily and when the door had opened wide\nthere was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale\ndangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the\nground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.\n\nBlinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant\ngroaning of the horns the apparition stood swaying for a moment before\nhe perceived the man in the duster.\n\n\"Wha's matter?\" he inquired calmly. \"Did we run outa gas?\"\n\n\"Look!\"\n\nHalf a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel--he stared\nat it for a moment and then looked upward as though he suspected that\nit had dropped from the sky.\n\n\"It came off,\" some one explained.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"At first I din' notice we'd stopped.\"\n\nA pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders\nhe remarked in a determined voice:\n\n\"Wonder'ff tell me where there's a gas'line station?\"\n\nAt least a dozen men, some of them little better off than he was,\nexplained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical\nbond.\n\n\"Back out,\" he suggested after a moment. \"Put her in reverse.\"\n\n\"But the WHEEL'S off!\"\n\nHe hesitated.\n\n\"No harm in trying,\" he said.\n\nThe caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and\ncut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a moon\nwas shining over Gatsby's house, making the night fine as before and\nsurviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. A\nsudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great\ndoors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host who\nstood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.\n\n\nReading over what I have written so far I see I have given the\nimpression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all\nthat absorbed me. On the contrary they were merely casual events in a\ncrowded summer and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less\nthan my personal affairs.\n\nMost of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my shadow\nwestward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the\nProbity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their\nfirst names and lunched with them in dark crowded restaurants on\nlittle pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I even had a short\naffair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the\naccounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my\ndirection so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow\nquietly away.\n\nI took dinner usually at the Yale Club--for some reason it was the\ngloomiest event of my day--and then I went upstairs to the library and\nstudied investments and securities for a conscientious hour.\nThere were generally a few rioters around but they never came into the\nlibrary so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was\nmellow I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel\nand over Thirty-third Street to the Pennsylvania Station.\n\nI began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night\nand the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and\nmachines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and\npick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few\nminutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever\nknow or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their\napartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled\nback at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the\nenchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes,\nand felt it in others--poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows\nwaiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner--young clerks\nin the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.\n\nAgain at eight o'clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were five\ndeep with throbbing taxi cabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a\nsinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited,\nand voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted\ncigarettes outlined unintelligible gestures inside. Imagining that\nI, too, was hurrying toward gayety and sharing their intimate\nexcitement, I wished them well.\n\nFor a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found\nher again. At first I was flattered to go places with her because she\nwas a golf champion and every one knew her name. Then it was\nsomething more. I wasn't actually in love, but I felt a sort of\ntender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the\nworld concealed something--most affectations conceal something\neventually, even though they don't in the beginning--and one day I found\nwhat it was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she\nleft a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied\nabout it--and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded\nme that night at Daisy's. At her first big golf tournament there was a\nrow that nearly reached the newspapers--a suggestion that she had moved\nher ball from a bad lie in the semi-final round. The thing approached\nthe proportions of a scandal--then died away. A caddy retracted his\nstatement and the only other witness admitted that he might have been\nmistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.\n\nJordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw\nthat this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence\nfrom a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest.\nShe wasn't able to endure being at a disadvantage, and given this\nunwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she\nwas very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the\nworld and yet satisfy the demands of her hard jaunty body.\n\nIt made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never\nblame deeply--I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that\nsame house party that we had a curious conversation about driving a\ncar. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our\nfender flicked a button on one man's coat.\n\n\"You're a rotten driver,\" I protested. \"Either you ought to be more\ncareful or you oughtn't to drive at all.\"\n\n\"I am careful.\"\n\n\"No, you're not.\"\n\n\"Well, other people are,\" she said lightly.\n\n\"What's that got to do with it?\"\n\n\"They'll keep out of my way,\" she insisted. \"It takes two to make an\naccident.\"\n\n\"Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.\"\n\n\"I hope I never will,\" she answered. \"I hate careless people. That's why\nI like you.\"\n\nHer grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had\ndeliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved\nher. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes\non my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of\nthat tangle back home. I'd been writing letters once a week and signing\nthem: \"Love, Nick,\" and all I could think of was how, when that certain\ngirl played tennis, a faint mustache of perspiration appeared on her\nupper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be\ntactfully broken off before I was free.\n\nEvery one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and\nthis is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n\n\nOn Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages along shore\nthe world and its mistress returned to Gatsby's house and twinkled\nhilariously on his lawn.\n\n\"He's a bootlegger,\" said the young ladies, moving somewhere between\nhis cocktails and his flowers. \"One time he killed a man who had found out\nthat he was nephew to von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil.\nReach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there crystal\nglass.\"\n\nOnce I wrote down on the empty spaces of a time-table the names\nof those who came to Gatsby's house that summer. It is an old time-table\nnow, disintegrating at its folds and headed \"This schedule in effect\nJuly 5th, 1922.\" But I can still read the grey names and they will give\nyou a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted\nGatsby's hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing\nwhatever about him.\n\nFrom East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches and a\nman named Bunsen whom I knew at Yale and Doctor Webster Civet who\nwas drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie\nVoltaires and a whole clan named Blackbuck who always gathered in a\ncorner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near.\nAnd the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr.\nChrystie's wife) and Edgar Beaver, whose hair they say turned\ncotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.\n\nClarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only\nonce, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named\nEtty in the garden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles\nand the O. R. P. Schraeders and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of\nGeorgia and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there\nthree days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the\ngravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett's automobile ran over his right\nhand. The Dancies came too and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over\nsixty, and Maurice A. Flink and the Hammerheads and Beluga the\ntobacco importer and Beluga's girls.\n\nFrom West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and\nCecil Schoen and Gulick the state senator and Newton Orchid who\ncontrolled Films Par Excellence and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don\nS. Schwartze (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the\nmovies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G.\nEarl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife.\nDa Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B.\n(\"Rot-Gut\") Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly--they came to\ngamble and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was\ncleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably\nnext day.\n\nA man named Klipspringer was there so often and so long that he became\nknown as \"the boarder\"--I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical\npeople there were Gus Waize and Horace O'Donavan and Lester Meyer and\nGeorge Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes\nand the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the\nCorrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W.\nBelcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry\nL. Palmetto who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train\nin Times Square.\n\nBenny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite\nthe same ones in physical person but they were so identical one with\nanother that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have\nforgotten their names--Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela or Gloria\nor Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names\nof flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American\ncapitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves to\nbe.\n\nIn addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O'Brien came\nthere at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer who had\nhis nose shot off in the war and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his\nfianc\u00e9e, and Ardita Fitz-Peters, and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of the\nAmerican Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip with a man reputed to be her\nchauffeur, and a prince of something whom we called Duke and whose name,\nif I ever knew it, I have forgotten.\n\nAll these people came to Gatsby's house in the summer.\n\n\nAt nine o'clock, one morning late in July Gatsby's gorgeous car\nlurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody\nfrom its three noted horn. It was the first time he had called on me\nthough I had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane,\nand, at his urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach.\n\n\"Good morning, old sport. You're having lunch with me today and I\nthought we'd ride up together.\"\n\nHe was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that\nresourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American--that comes,\nI suppose, with the absence of lifting work or rigid sitting in youth\nand, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games.\nThis quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in\nthe shape of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a\ntapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.\n\nHe saw me looking with admiration at his car.\n\n\"It's pretty, isn't it, old sport.\" He jumped off to give me a better\nview. \"Haven't you ever seen it before?\"\n\nI'd seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream color, bright\nwith nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with\ntriumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a\nlabyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind\nmany layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory we started\nto town.\n\nI had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and\nfound, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first\nimpression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had\ngradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate\nroadhouse next door.\n\nAnd then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn't reached West Egg\nvillage before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished\nand slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-colored\nsuit.\n\n\"Look here, old sport,\" he broke out surprisingly. \"What's your opinion\nof me, anyhow?\"\n\nA little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which\nthat question deserves.\n\n\"Well, I'm going to tell you something about my life,\" he interrupted.\n\"I don't want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you\nhear.\"\n\nSo he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavored conversation in\nhis halls.\n\n\"I'll tell you God's truth.\" His right hand suddenly ordered divine\nretribution to stand by. \"I am the son of some wealthy people in the\nmiddle-west--all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at\nOxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years.\nIt is a family tradition.\"\n\nHe looked at me sideways--and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was\nlying. He hurried the phrase \"educated at Oxford,\" or swallowed it or\nchoked on it as though it had bothered him before. And with this doubt\nhis whole statement fell to pieces and I wondered if there wasn't\nsomething a little sinister about him after all.\n\n\"What part of the middle-west?\" I inquired casually.\n\n\"San Francisco.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\n\"My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.\"\n\nHis voice was solemn as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan\nstill haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg\nbut a glance at him convinced me otherwise.\n\n\"After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of\nEurope--Paris, Venice, Rome--collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting\nbig game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to\nforget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.\"\n\nWith an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very\nphrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a\nturbaned \"character\" leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a\ntiger through the Bois de Boulogne.\n\n\"Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief and I tried very\nhard to die but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a\ncommission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I\ntook two machine-gun detachments so far forward that there was a half\nmile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn't advance. We\nstayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty men with\nsixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last they found\nthe insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead. I was\npromoted to be a major and every Allied government gave me a\ndecoration--even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic\nSea!\"\n\nLittle Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them--with\nhis smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro's troubled history and\nsympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It\nappreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had\nelicited this tribute from Montenegro's warm little heart. My\nincredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming\nhastily through a dozen magazines.\n\nHe reached in his pocket and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon, fell\ninto my palm.\n\n\"That's the one from Montenegro.\"\n\nTo my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look.\n\n_Orderi di Danilo_, ran the circular legend, _Montenegro, Nicolas Rex_.\n\n\"Turn it.\"\n\n_Major Jay Gatsby_, I read, _For Valour Extraordinary_.\n\n\"Here's another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It was\ntaken in Trinity Quad--the man on my left is now the Earl of Dorcaster.\"\n\nIt was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an\narchway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby,\nlooking a little, not much, younger--with a cricket bat in his hand.\n\nThen it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace\non the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with\ntheir crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.\n\n\"I'm going to make a big request of you today,\" he said, pocketing his\nsouvenirs with satisfaction, \"so I thought you ought to know something\nabout me. I didn't want you to think I was just some nobody. You see,\nI usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there\ntrying to forget the sad thing that happened to me.\" He hesitated.\n\"You'll hear about it this afternoon.\"\n\n\"At lunch?\"\n\n\"No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you're taking Miss Baker\nto tea.\"\n\n\"Do you mean you're in love with Miss Baker?\"\n\n\"No, old sport, I'm not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak\nto you about this matter.\"\n\nI hadn't the faintest idea what \"this matter\" was, but I was more\nannoyed than interested. I hadn't asked Jordan to tea in order to discuss\nMr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something utterly\nfantastic and for a moment I was sorry I'd ever set foot upon his\noverpopulated lawn.\n\nHe wouldn't say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared\nthe city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of\nred-belted ocean-going ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with\nthe dark, undeserted saloons of the faded gilt nineteen-hundreds. Then\nthe valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a glimpse\nof Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we\nwent by.\n\nWith fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half\nAstoria--only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the\nelevated I heard the familiar \"jug--jug--SPAT!\" of a motor cycle, and a\nfrantic policeman rode alongside.\n\n\"All right, old sport,\" called Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a white\ncard from his wallet he waved it before the man's eyes.\n\n\"Right you are,\" agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. \"Know you next\ntime, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse ME!\"\n\n\"What was that?\" I inquired.  \"The picture of Oxford?\"\n\n\"I was able to do the commissioner a favor once, and he sends me a\nChristmas card every year.\"\n\nOver the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a\nconstant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the\nriver in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of\nnon-olfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always\nthe city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the\nmystery and the beauty in the world.\n\nA dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two\ncarriages with drawn blinds and by more cheerful carriages for\nfriends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short\nupper lips of south-eastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of\nGatsby's splendid car was included in their somber holiday. As we\ncrossed Blackwell's Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white\nchauffeur, in which sat three modish Negroes, two bucks and a girl. I\nlaughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in\nhaughty rivalry.\n\n\"Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge,\" I thought;\n\"anything at all. . . .\"\n\nEven Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.\n\n\nRoaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby\nfor lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside my eyes\npicked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.\n\n\"Mr. Carraway this is my friend Mr. Wolfsheim.\"\n\nA small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two\nfine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I\ndiscovered his tiny eyes in the half darkness.\n\n\"--so I took one look at him--\" said Mr. Wolfsheim, shaking my hand\nearnestly, \"--and what do you think I did?\"\n\n\"What?\" I inquired politely.\n\nBut evidently he was not addressing me for he dropped my hand and\ncovered Gatsby with his expressive nose.\n\n\"I handed the money to Katspaugh and I sid, 'All right, Katspaugh,\ndon't pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.' He shut it then and\nthere.\"\n\nGatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the\nrestaurant whereupon Mr. Wolfsheim swallowed a new sentence he was\nstarting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.\n\n\"Highballs?\" asked the head waiter.\n\n\"This is a nice restaurant here,\" said Mr. Wolfsheim looking at the\nPresbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. \"But I like across the street better!\"\n\n\"Yes, highballs,\" agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfsheim: \"It's too hot\nover there.\"\n\n\"Hot and small--yes,\" said Mr. Wolfsheim, \"but full of memories.\"\n\n\"What place is that?\" I asked.\n\n\"The old Metropole.\n\n\"The old Metropole,\" brooded Mr. Wolfsheim gloomily. \"Filled with faces\ndead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can't forget so\nlong as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It was six of us\nat the table and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening. When it was\nalmost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says\nsomebody wants to speak to him outside. 'All right,' says Rosy and begins\nto get up and I pulled him down in his chair.\n\n\" 'Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don't you,\nso help me, move outside this room.'\n\n\"It was four o'clock in the morning then, and if we'd of raised the blinds\nwe'd of seen daylight.\"\n\n\"Did he go?\" I asked innocently.\n\n\"Sure he went,\"--Mr. Wolfsheim's nose flashed at me indignantly--\"He\nturned around in the door and says, 'Don't let that waiter take away\nmy coffee!' Then he went out on the sidewalk and they shot him\nthree times in his full belly and drove away.\"\n\n\"Four of them were electrocuted,\" I said, remembering.\n\n\"Five with Becker.\" His nostrils turned to me in an interested way.\n\"I understand you're looking for a business gonnegtion.\"\n\nThe juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered\nfor me:\n\n\"Oh, no,\" he exclaimed, \"this isn't the man!\"\n\n\"No?\" Mr. Wolfsheim seemed disappointed.\n\n\"This is just a friend. I told you we'd talk about that some other\ntime.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. Wolfsheim, \"I had a wrong man.\"\n\nA succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfsheim, forgetting the more\nsentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with\nferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the\nroom--he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly\nbehind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have taken one\nshort glance beneath our own table.\n\n\"Look here, old sport,\" said Gatsby, leaning toward me, \"I'm afraid I\nmade you a little angry this morning in the car.\"\n\nThere was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.\n\n\"I don't like mysteries,\" I answered. \"And I don't understand why you\nwon't come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got to\ncome through Miss Baker?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing underhand,\" he assured me. \"Miss Baker's a great\nsportswoman, you know, and she'd never do anything that wasn't all right.\"\n\nSuddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up and hurried from the room\nleaving me with Mr. Wolfsheim at the table.\n\n\"He has to telephone,\" said Mr. Wolfsheim, following him with his eyes.\n\"Fine fellow, isn't he? Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"He's an Oggsford man.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?\"\n\n\"I've heard of it.\"\n\n\"It's one of the most famous colleges in the world.\"\n\n\"Have you known Gatsby for a long time?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Several years,\" he answered in a gratified way. \"I made the pleasure of\nhis acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a man of\nfine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to myself: 'There's\nthe kind of man you'd like to take home and introduce to your mother and\nsister.' \" He paused. \"I see you're looking at my cuff buttons.\"\n\nI hadn't been looking at them, but I did now.  They were composed of\noddly familiar pieces of ivory.\n\n\"Finest specimens of human molars,\" he informed me.\n\n\"Well!\" I inspected them. \"That's a very interesting idea.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. \"Yeah, Gatsby's very\ncareful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend's wife.\"\n\nWhen the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat\ndown Mr. Wolfsheim drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet.\n\n\"I have enjoyed my lunch,\" he said, \"and I'm going to run off from you\ntwo young men before I outstay my welcome.\"\n\n\"Don't hurry, Meyer,\" said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfsheim\nraised his hand in a sort of benediction.\n\n\"You're very polite but I belong to another generation,\" he announced\nsolemnly. \"You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and\nyour----\" He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his\nhand--\"As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won't impose myself\non you any longer.\"\n\nAs he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling.\nI wondered if I had said anything to offend him.\n\n\"He becomes very sentimental sometimes,\" explained Gatsby. \"This is one of\nhis sentimental days. He's quite a character around New York--a denizen of\nBroadway.\"\n\n\"Who is he anyhow--an actor?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"A dentist?\"\n\n\"Meyer Wolfsheim? No, he's a gambler.\" Gatsby hesitated, then added\ncoolly: \"He's the man who fixed the World's Series back in 1919.\"\n\n\"Fixed the World's Series?\" I repeated.\n\nThe idea staggered me. I remembered of course that the World's Series\nhad been fixed in 1919 but if I had thought of it at all I would have\nthought of it as a thing that merely HAPPENED, the end of some\ninevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could start to\nplay with the faith of fifty million people--with the single-mindedness\nof a burglar blowing a safe.\n\n\"How did he happen to do that?\" I asked after a minute.\n\n\"He just saw the opportunity.\"\n\n\"Why isn't he in jail?\"\n\n\"They can't get him, old sport. He's a smart man.\"\n\nI insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I caught\nsight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.\n\n\"Come along with me for a minute,\" I said. \"I've got to say hello\nto someone.\"\n\nWhen he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our\ndirection.\n\n\"Where've you been?\" he demanded eagerly. \"Daisy's furious because you\nhaven't called up.\"\n\n\"This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.\"\n\nThey shook hands briefly and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment\ncame over Gatsby's face.\n\n\"How've you been, anyhow?\" demanded Tom of me. \"How'd you happen to come\nup this far to eat?\"\n\n\"I've been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.\"\n\nI turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.\n\n\nOne October day in nineteen-seventeen----\n(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight\nchair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)\n--I was walking along from one place to another half on the sidewalks and\nhalf on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from\nEngland with rubber nobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground.\nI had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind and\nwhenever this happened the red, white and blue banners in front of all\nthe houses stretched out stiff and said TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT in a disapproving\nway.\n\nThe largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to\nDaisy Fay's house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and\nby far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She\ndressed in white, and had a little white roadster and all day long\nthe telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp\nTaylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night, \"anyways,\nfor an hour!\"\n\nWhen I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside\nthe curb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen\nbefore. They were so engrossed in each other that she didn't see me until\nI was five feet away.\n\n\"Hello Jordan,\" she called unexpectedly. \"Please come here.\"\n\nI was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older\ngirls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and\nmake bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn't come\nthat day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way\nthat every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it\nseemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since. His name\nwas Jay Gatsby and I didn't lay eyes on him again for over four\nyears--even after I'd met him on Long Island I didn't realize it was the\nsame man.\n\nThat was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux myself,\nand I began to play in tournaments, so I didn't see Daisy very often.\nShe went with a slightly older crowd--when she went with anyone at all.\nWild rumors were circulating about her--how her mother had found her\npacking her bag one winter night to go to New York and say goodbye to a\nsoldier who was going overseas. She was effectually prevented, but she\nwasn't on speaking terms with her family for several weeks. After\nthat she didn't play around with the soldiers any more but only\nwith a few flat-footed, short-sighted young men in town who couldn't\nget into the army at all.\n\nBy the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a debut\nafter the Armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a\nman from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago with\nmore pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He came\ndown with a hundred people in four private cars and hired a whole\nfloor of the Seelbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave her\na string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\n\nI was bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the bridal\ndinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in\nher flowered dress--and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle of\nsauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.\n\n\" 'Gratulate me,\" she muttered. \"Never had a drink before but oh, how I do\nenjoy it.\"\n\n\"What's the matter, Daisy?\"\n\nI was scared, I can tell you; I'd never seen a girl like that before.\n\n\"Here, dearis.\" She groped around in a waste-basket she had with her\non the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. \"Take 'em downstairs and\ngive 'em back to whoever they belong to. Tell 'em all Daisy's change' her\nmine. Say 'Daisy's change' her mine!'.\"\n\nShe began to cry--she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her\nmother's maid and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath. She\nwouldn't let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her and\nsqueezed it up into a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the\nsoap dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.\n\nBut she didn't say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and put\nice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress and half an\nhour later when we walked out of the room the pearls were around her\nneck and the incident was over. Next day at five o'clock she married Tom\nBuchanan without so much as a shiver and started off on a three months'\ntrip to the South Seas.\n\nI saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back and I thought I'd\nnever seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he left the room for a\nminute she'd look around uneasily and say \"Where's Tom gone?\" and\nwear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the\ndoor. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour\nrubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable\ndelight. It was touching to see them together--it made you laugh in a\nhushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I left Santa\nBarbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night and ripped\na front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got into the\npapers too because her arm was broken--she was one of the chambermaids\nin the Santa Barbara Hotel.\n\nThe next April Daisy had her little girl and they went to France for a\nyear. I saw them one spring in Cannes and later in Deauville and then\nthey came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in Chicago,\nas you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich\nand wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation.\nPerhaps because she doesn't drink. It's a great advantage not to drink\namong hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and, moreover,\nyou can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else\nis so blind that they don't see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in\nfor amour at all--and yet there's something in that voice of hers. . . .\n\nWell, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time\nin years. It was when I asked you--do you remember?--if you knew Gatsby\nin West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me\nup, and said \"What Gatsby?\" and when I described him--I was half\nasleep--she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used\nto know. It wasn't until then that I connected this Gatsby with the\nofficer in her white car.\n\n\nWhen Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza\nfor half an hour and were driving in a Victoria through Central Park.\nThe sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in\nthe West Fifties and the clear voices of girls, already gathered like\ncrickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:\n\n\n    \"I'm the Sheik of Araby,\n    Your love belongs to me.\n    At night when you're asleep,\n    Into your tent I'll creep----\"\n\n\n\"It was a strange coincidence,\" I said.\n\n\"But it wasn't a coincidence at all.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.\"\n\nThen it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired\non that June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the\nwomb of his purposeless splendor.\n\n\"He wants to know--\" continued Jordan \"--if you'll invite Daisy to your\nhouse some afternoon and then let him come over.\"\n\nThe modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and bought a\nmansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths so that he could\n\"come over\" some afternoon to a stranger's garden.\n\n\"Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?\"\n\n\"He's afraid. He's waited so long. He thought you might be offended.\nYou see he's a regular tough underneath it all.\"\n\nSomething worried me.\n\n\"Why didn't he ask you to arrange a meeting?\"\n\n\"He wants her to see his house,\" she explained. \"And your house is right\nnext door.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties,\nsome night,\" went on Jordan, \"but she never did. Then he began asking\npeople casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found.\nIt was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have\nheard the elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately\nsuggested a luncheon in New York--and I thought he'd go mad:\n\n\" 'I don't want to do anything out of the way!' he kept saying. 'I want to\nsee her right next door.'\n\n\"When I said you were a particular friend of Tom's he started to abandon\nthe whole idea. He doesn't know very much about Tom, though he says he's\nread a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse\nof Daisy's name.\"\n\nIt was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm\naround Jordan's golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to\ndinner. Suddenly I wasn't thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more but of\nthis clean, hard, limited person who dealt in universal skepticism and\nwho leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm. A phrase began\nto beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: \"There are only the\npursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.\"\n\n\"And Daisy ought to have something in her life,\" murmured Jordan to me.\n\n\"Does she want to see Gatsby?\"\n\n\"She's not to know about it. Gatsby doesn't want her to know. You're\njust supposed to invite her to tea.\"\n\nWe passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the facade of Fifty-ninth\nStreet, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park.\nUnlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan I had no girl whose disembodied face\nfloated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so I drew up the\ngirl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth smiled and so\nI drew her up again, closer, this time to my face.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n\n\nWhen I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that\nmy house was on fire. Two o'clock and the whole corner of the peninsula\nwas blazing with light which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin\nelongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a corner I saw that it\nwas Gatsby's house, lit from tower to cellar.\n\nAt first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved\nitself into \"hide-and-go-seek\" or \"sardines-in-the-box\" with all the\nhouse thrown open to the game. But there wasn't a sound. Only wind in\nthe trees which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again\nas if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned away I\nsaw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.\n\n\"Your place looks like the world's fair,\" I said.\n\n\"Does it?\" He turned his eyes toward it absently. \"I have been glancing\ninto some of the rooms. Let's go to Coney Island, old sport. In my car.\"\n\n\"It's too late.\"\n\n\"Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven't made use\nof it all summer.\"\n\n\"I've got to go to bed.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nHe waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.\n\n\"I talked with Miss Baker,\" I said after a moment. \"I'm going to call up\nDaisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" he said carelessly. \"I don't want to put you to\nany trouble.\"\n\n\"What day would suit you?\"\n\n\"What day would suit YOU?\" he corrected me quickly. \"I don't want to put\nyou to any trouble, you see.\"\n\n\"How about the day after tomorrow?\" He considered for a moment. Then,\nwith reluctance:\n\n\"I want to get the grass cut,\" he said.\n\nWe both looked at the grass--there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn\nended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I suspected that\nhe meant my grass.\n\n\"There's another little thing,\" he said uncertainly, and hesitated.\n\n\"Would you rather put it off for a few days?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, it isn't about that. At least----\" He fumbled with a series of\nbeginnings. \"Why, I thought--why, look here, old sport, you don't make\nmuch money, do you?\"\n\n\"Not very much.\"\n\nThis seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.\n\n\"I thought you didn't, if you'll pardon my--you see, I carry on a\nlittle business on the side, a sort of sideline, you understand. And I\nthought that if you don't make very much--You're selling bonds, aren't\nyou, old sport?\"\n\n\"Trying to.\"\n\n\"Well, this would interest you. It wouldn't take up much of your\ntime and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be\na rather confidential sort of thing.\"\n\nI realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might\nhave been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer was\nobviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no choice\nexcept to cut him off there.\n\n\"I've got my hands full,\" I said. \"I'm much obliged but I couldn't take\non any more work.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't have to do any business with Wolfsheim.\" Evidently he\nthought that I was shying away from the \"gonnegtion\" mentioned at lunch,\nbut I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer, hoping I'd\nbegin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went\nunwillingly home.\n\nThe evening had made me light-headed and happy; I think I walked into a\ndeep sleep as I entered my front door. So I didn't know whether or not\nGatsby went to Coney Island or for how many hours he \"glanced into\nrooms\" while his house blazed gaudily on. I called up Daisy from the\noffice next morning and invited her to come to tea.\n\n\"Don't bring Tom,\" I warned her.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Don't bring Tom.\"\n\n\"Who is 'Tom'?\" she asked innocently.\n\nThe day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven o'clock a man in a\nraincoat dragging a lawn-mower tapped at my front door and said that\nMr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I\nhad forgotten to tell my Finn to come back so I drove into West Egg\nVillage to search for her among soggy white-washed alleys and to buy\nsome cups and lemons and flowers.\n\nThe flowers were unnecessary, for at two o'clock a greenhouse arrived\nfrom Gatsby's, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour\nlater the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel\nsuit, silver shirt and gold-colored tie hurried in. He was pale and\nthere were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.\n\n\"Is everything all right?\" he asked immediately.\n\n\"The grass looks fine, if that's what you mean.\"\n\n\"What grass?\" he inquired blankly. \"Oh, the grass in the yard.\" He looked\nout the window at it, but judging from his expression I don't believe\nhe saw a thing.\n\n\"Looks very good,\" he remarked vaguely. \"One of the papers said they\nthought the rain would stop about four. I think it was 'The Journal.' Have\nyou got everything you need in the shape of--of tea?\"\n\nI took him into the pantry where he looked a little reproachfully at the\nFinn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen\nshop.\n\n\"Will they do?\" I asked.\n\n\"Of course, of course! They're fine!\" and he added hollowly, \". . .old\nsport.\"\n\nThe rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist through which\noccasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes\nthrough a copy of Clay's \"Economics,\" starting at the Finnish tread that\nshook the kitchen floor and peering toward the bleared windows from time\nto time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking\nplace outside. Finally he got up and informed me in an uncertain voice\nthat he was going home.\n\n\"Why's that?\"\n\n\"Nobody's coming to tea. It's too late!\" He looked at his watch as if\nthere was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. \"I can't wait\nall day.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly; it's just two minutes to four.\"\n\nHe sat down, miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously there\nwas the sound of a motor turning into my lane. We both jumped up and,\na little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.\n\nUnder the dripping bare lilac trees a large open car was coming up the\ndrive. It stopped. Daisy's face, tipped sideways beneath a\nthree-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic\nsmile.\n\n\"Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?\"\n\nThe exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had\nto follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone\nbefore any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of\nblue paint across her cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as\nI took it to help her from the car.\n\n\"Are you in love with me,\" she said low in my ear. \"Or why did I have\nto come alone?\"\n\n\"That's the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far\naway and spend an hour.\"\n\n\"Come back in an hour, Ferdie.\" Then in a grave murmur, \"His name is\nFerdie.\"\n\n\"Does the gasoline affect his nose?\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" she said innocently. \"Why?\"\n\nWe went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living room was deserted.\n\n\"Well, that's funny!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"What's funny?\"\n\nShe turned her head as there was a light, dignified knocking at the front\ndoor. I went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands\nplunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of\nwater glaring tragically into my eyes.\n\nWith his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the\nhall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire and disappeared into the\nliving room. It wasn't a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of my own\nheart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.\n\nFor half a minute there wasn't a sound. Then from the living room I\nheard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh followed by Daisy's\nvoice on a clear artificial note.\n\n\"I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.\"\n\nA pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall so I went\ninto the room.\n\nGatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the\nmantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom.\nHis head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a\ndefunct mantelpiece clock and from this position his distraught eyes\nstared down at Daisy who was sitting frightened but graceful on the\nedge of a stiff chair.\n\n\"We've met before,\" muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily at\nme and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily\nthe clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his\nhead, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers and set\nit back in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the\nsofa and his chin in his hand.\n\n\"I'm sorry about the clock,\" he said.\n\nMy own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldn't muster up\na single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.\n\n\"It's an old clock,\" I told them idiotically.\n\nI think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on\nthe floor.\n\n\"We haven't met for many years,\" said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact\nas it could ever be.\n\n\"Five years next November.\"\n\nThe automatic quality of Gatsby's answer set us all back at least another\nminute. I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that\nthey help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in\non a tray.\n\nAmid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency\nestablished itself. Gatsby got himself into a shadow and while Daisy\nand I talked looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with\ntense unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn't an end in itself I\nmade an excuse at the first possible moment and got to my feet.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.\n\n\"I'll be back.\"\n\n\"I've got to speak to you about something before you go.\"\n\nHe followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door and whispered:\n\"Oh, God!\" in a miserable way.\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"This is a terrible mistake,\" he said, shaking his head from side to\nside, \"a terrible, terrible mistake.\"\n\n\"You're just embarrassed, that's all,\" and luckily I added: \"Daisy's\nembarrassed too.\"\n\n\"She's embarrassed?\" he repeated incredulously.\n\n\"Just as much as you are.\"\n\n\"Don't talk so loud.\"\n\n\"You're acting like a little boy,\" I broke out impatiently. \"Not only\nthat but you're rude. Daisy's sitting in there all alone.\"\n\n\nHe raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable\nreproach and opening the door cautiously went back into the other room.\n\nI walked out the back way--just as Gatsby had when he had made his\nnervous circuit of the house half an hour before--and ran for a huge\nblack knotted tree whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain.\nOnce more it was pouring and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by\nGatsby's gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric\nmarshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree except\nGatsby's enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church\nsteeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the \"period\"\ncraze, a decade before, and there was a story that he'd agreed to pay\nfive years' taxes on all the neighboring cottages if the owners would\nhave their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the\nheart out of his plan to Found a Family--he went into an immediate\ndecline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the\ndoor. Americans, while occasionally willing to be serfs, have always\nbeen obstinate about being peasantry.\n\nAfter half an hour the sun shone again and the grocer's automobile\nrounded Gatsby's drive with the raw material for his servants' dinner--I\nfelt sure he wouldn't eat a spoonful. A maid began opening the upper\nwindows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from a\nlarge central bay, spat meditatively into the garden. It was time I\nwent back. While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of\ntheir voices, rising and swelling a little, now and then, with gusts of\nemotion. But in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen within\nthe house too.\n\nI went in--after making every possible noise in the kitchen short of\npushing over the stove--but I don't believe they heard a sound. They\nwere sitting at either end of the couch looking at each other as if\nsome question had been asked or was in the air, and every vestige of\nembarrassment was gone. Daisy's face was smeared with tears and when I\ncame in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before\na mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding.\nHe literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new\nwell-being radiated from him and filled the little room.\n\n\"Oh, hello, old sport,\" he said, as if he hadn't seen me for years. I\nthought for a moment he was going to shake hands.\n\n\"It's stopped raining.\"\n\n\"Has it?\" When he realized what I was talking about, that there were\ntwinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man,\nlike an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to\nDaisy. \"What do you think of that? It's stopped raining.\"\n\n\"I'm glad, Jay.\" Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only\nof her unexpected joy.\n\n\"I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,\" he said, \"I'd like to\nshow her around.\"\n\n\"You're sure you want me to come?\"\n\n\"Absolutely, old sport.\"\n\nDaisy went upstairs to wash her face--too late I thought with humiliation\nof my towels--while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.\n\n\"My house looks well, doesn't it?\" he demanded. \"See how the whole\nfront of it catches the light.\"\n\nI agreed that it was splendid.\n\n\"Yes.\" His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. \"It took\nme just three years to earn the money that bought it.\"\n\n\"I thought you inherited your money.\"\n\n\"I did, old sport,\" he said automatically, \"but I lost most of it in\nthe big panic--the panic of the war.\"\n\nI think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what\nbusiness he was in he answered \"That's my affair,\" before he realized\nthat it wasn't the appropriate reply.\n\n\"Oh, I've been in several things,\" he corrected himself. \"I was in the\ndrug business and then I was in the oil business. But I'm not in either\none now.\" He looked at me with more attention. \"Do you mean you've been\nthinking over what I proposed the other night?\"\n\nBefore I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass\nbuttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.\n\n\"That huge place THERE?\" she cried pointing.\n\n\"Do you like it?\"\n\n\"I love it, but I don't see how you live there all alone.\"\n\n\"I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People who\ndo interesting things. Celebrated people.\"\n\nInstead of taking the short cut along the Sound we went down the road and\nentered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this\naspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the\ngardens, the sparkling odor of jonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn\nand plum blossoms and the pale gold odor of kiss-me-at-the-gate.\nIt was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright\ndresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the\ntrees.\n\nAnd inside as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music rooms and\nRestoration salons I felt that there were guests concealed behind\nevery couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we\nhad passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of \"the Merton College\nLibrary\" I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into\nghostly laughter.\n\nWe went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender\nsilk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing rooms and poolrooms,\nand bathrooms with sunken baths--intruding into one chamber where a\ndishevelled man in pajamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It\nwas Mr. Klipspringer, the \"boarder.\" I had seen him wandering hungrily\nabout the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby's own apartment,\na bedroom and a bath and an Adam study, where we sat down and drank a\nglass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall.\n\nHe hadn't once ceased looking at Daisy and I think he revalued\neverything in his house according to the measure of response it drew\nfrom her well-loved eyes. Sometimes, too, he stared around at his\npossessions in a dazed way as though in her actual and astounding\npresence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a\nflight of stairs.\n\nHis bedroom was the simplest room of all--except where the dresser was\ngarnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush\nwith delight and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and\nshaded his eyes and began to laugh.\n\n\"It's the funniest thing, old sport,\" he said hilariously. \"I can't--when\nI try to----\"\n\nHe had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third.\nAfter his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with\nwonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed it\nright through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak, at an\ninconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction, he was running\ndown like an overwound clock.\n\nRecovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent\ncabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and\nhis shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.\n\n\"I've got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection\nof things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.\"\n\nHe took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one\nbefore us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel\nwhich lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in\nmany-colored disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft\nrich heap mounted higher--shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in\ncoral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange with monograms of\nIndian blue. Suddenly with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into\nthe shirts and began to cry stormily.\n\n\"They're such beautiful shirts,\" she sobbed, her voice muffled in the\nthick folds. \"It makes me sad because I've never seen such--such beautiful\nshirts before.\"\n\n\nAfter the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and the\nhydroplane and the midsummer flowers--but outside Gatsby's window it\nbegan to rain again so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated\nsurface of the Sound.\n\n\"If it wasn't for the mist we could see your home across the bay,\" said\nGatsby. \"You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of\nyour dock.\"\n\nDaisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed\nin what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the\ncolossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared\nto the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed\nvery near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star\nto the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of\nenchanted objects had diminished by one.\n\nI began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in\nthe half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting\ncostume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.\n\n\"Who's this?\"\n\n\"That? That's Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.\"\n\nThe name sounded faintly familiar.\n\n\"He's dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.\"\n\nThere was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the\nbureau--Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly--taken apparently\nwhen he was about eighteen.\n\n\"I adore it!\" exclaimed Daisy. \"The pompadour! You never told me you had\na pompadour--or a yacht.\"\n\n\"Look at this,\" said Gatsby quickly. \"Here's a lot of clippings--about\nyou.\"\n\nThey stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the rubies\nwhen the phone rang and Gatsby took up the receiver.\n\n\"Yes. . . . Well, I can't talk now. . . . I can't talk now, old\nsport. . . . I said a SMALL town. . . . He must know what a small town\nis. . . . Well, he's no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small\ntown. . . .\"\n\nHe rang off.\n\n\"Come here QUICK!\" cried Daisy at the window.\n\nThe rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west,\nand there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.\n\n\"Look at that,\" she whispered, and then after a moment: \"I'd like to\njust get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you\naround.\"\n\nI tried to go then, but they wouldn't hear of it; perhaps my presence\nmade them feel more satisfactorily alone.\n\n\"I know what we'll do,\" said Gatsby, \"we'll have Klipspringer play the\npiano.\"\n\nHe went out of the room calling \"Ewing!\" and returned in a few\nminutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man with\nshell-rimmed glasses and scanty blonde hair. He was now decently clothed\nin a \"sport shirt\" open at the neck, sneakers and duck trousers of a\nnebulous hue.\n\n\"Did we interrupt your exercises?\" inquired Daisy politely.\n\n\"I was asleep,\" cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment.\n\"That is, I'd BEEN asleep. Then I got up. . . .\"\n\n\"Klipspringer plays the piano,\" said Gatsby, cutting him off. \"Don't you,\nEwing, old sport?\"\n\n\"I don't play well. I don't--I hardly play at all. I'm all out of\nprac----\"\n\n\"We'll go downstairs,\" interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The\ngrey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.\n\nIn the music room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano. He\nlit Daisy's cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on\na couch far across the room where there was no light save what the\ngleaming floor bounced in from the hall.\n\nWhen Klipspringer had played \"The Love Nest\" he turned around on the\nbench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.\n\n\"I'm all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn't play. I'm all\nout of prac----\"\n\n\"Don't talk so much, old sport,\" commanded Gatsby. \"Play!\"\n\n\n    IN THE MORNING,\n    IN THE EVENING,\n       AIN'T WE GOT FUN----\n\nOutside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the\nSound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains,\nmen-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York. It was\nthe hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating on\nthe air.\n\n\n    ONE THING'S SURE AND NOTHING'S SURER\n    THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET--CHILDREN.\n       IN THE MEANTIME,\n       IN BETWEEN TIME----\n\n\nAs I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of bewilderment\nhad come back into Gatsby's face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to\nhim as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost five\nyears! There must have been moments even that afternoon when\nDaisy tumbled short of his dreams--not through her own fault but\nbecause of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond\nher, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative\npassion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright\nfeather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can\nchallenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.\n\nAs I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took\nhold of hers and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward\nher with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most with its\nfluctuating, feverish warmth because it couldn't be over-dreamed--that\nvoice was a deathless song.\n\nThey had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand;\nGatsby didn't know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they\nlooked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I went out\nof the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there\ntogether.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n\n\nAbout this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one\nmorning at Gatsby's door and asked him if he had anything to say.\n\n\"Anything to say about what?\" inquired Gatsby politely.\n\n\"Why,--any statement to give out.\"\n\nIt transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard\nGatsby's name around his office in a connection which he either\nwouldn't reveal or didn't fully understand. This was his day off\nand with laudable initiative he had hurried out \"to see.\"\n\nIt was a random shot, and yet the reporter's instinct was right. Gatsby's\nnotoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his\nhospitality and so become authorities on his past, had increased\nall summer until he fell just short of being news. Contemporary\nlegends such as the \"underground pipe-line to Canada\" attached\nthemselves to him, and there was one persistent story that he\ndidn't live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house\nand was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore. Just why\nthese inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North\nDakota, isn't easy to say.\n\nJames Gatz--that was really, or at least legally, his name. He had\nchanged it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that\nwitnessed the beginning of his career--when he saw Dan Cody's yacht drop\nanchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior. It was James Gatz\nwho had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green\njersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby who\nborrowed a row-boat, pulled out to the TUOLOMEE and informed Cody that\na wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour.\n\nI suppose he'd had the name ready for a long time, even then. His\nparents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people--his imagination had\nnever really accepted them as his parents at all. The truth was that\nJay Gatsby, of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic\nconception of himself. He was a son of God--a phrase which, if it means\nanything, means just that--and he must be about His Father's Business,\nthe service of a vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty. So he invented\njust the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be\nlikely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.\n\nFor over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of\nLake Superior as a clam digger and a salmon fisher or in any other\ncapacity that brought him food and bed. His brown, hardening body lived\nnaturally through the half fierce, half lazy work of the bracing days.\nHe knew women early and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous\nof them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of the others\nbecause they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming\nself-absorption he took for granted.\n\nBut his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque\nand fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe\nof ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the\nclock ticked on the wash-stand and the moon soaked with wet\nlight his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the\npattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid\nscene with an oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an\noutlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the\nunreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded\nsecurely on a fairy's wing.\n\nAn instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to\nthe small Lutheran college of St. Olaf in southern Minnesota. He stayed\nthere two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of\nhis destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor's work with\nwhich he was to pay his way through. Then he drifted back to Lake\nSuperior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day\nthat Dan Cody's yacht dropped anchor in the shallows along shore.\n\nCody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields,\nof the Yukon, of every rush for metal since Seventy-five. The\ntransactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire\nfound him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and,\nsuspecting this an infinite number of women tried to separate him from\nhis money. The none too savory ramifications by which Ella Kaye, the\nnewspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him\nto sea in a yacht, were common knowledge to the turgid journalism\nof 1902. He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five\nyears when he turned up as James Gatz's destiny at Little Girl Bay.\n\nTo the young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed\ndeck, the yacht represented all the beauty and glamor in the world. I\nsuppose he smiled at Cody--he had probably discovered that people liked\nhim when he smiled. At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of\nthem elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick, and\nextravagantly ambitious. A few days later he took him to Duluth and\nbought him a blue coat, six pair of white duck trousers and a yachting\ncap. And when the TUOLOMEE left for the West Indies and the Barbary\nCoast Gatsby left too.\n\nHe was employed in a vague personal capacity--while he remained with\nCody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor,\nfor Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be\nabout and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more\ntrust in Gatsby. The arrangement lasted five years during which the\nboat went three times around the continent. It might have lasted\nindefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night\nin Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died.\n\nI remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby's bedroom, a grey, florid\nman with a hard empty face--the pioneer debauchee who during one phase\nof American life brought back to the eastern seaboard the savage\nviolence of the frontier brothel and saloon. It was indirectly due to\nCody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gay parties\nwomen used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the\nhabit of letting liquor alone.\n\nAnd it was from Cody that he inherited money--a legacy of twenty-five\nthousand dollars. He didn't get it. He never understood the legal\ndevice that was used against him but what remained of the millions\nwent intact to Ella Kaye. He was left with his singularly appropriate\neducation; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the\nsubstantiality of a man.\n\n\nHe told me all this very much later, but I've put it down here with the\nidea of exploding those first wild rumors about his antecedents, which\nweren't even faintly true. Moreover he told it to me at a time of\nconfusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and\nnothing about him. So I take advantage of this short halt, while\nGatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of\nmisconceptions away.\n\nIt was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. For\nseveral weeks I didn't see him or hear his voice on the phone--mostly\nI was in New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to\ningratiate myself with her senile aunt--but finally I went over to\nhis house one Sunday afternoon. I hadn't been there two minutes when\nsomebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink. I was startled,\nnaturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadn't happened\nbefore.\n\nThey were a party of three on horseback--Tom and a man named Sloane and\na pretty woman in a brown riding habit who had been there previously.\n\n\"I'm delighted to see you,\" said Gatsby standing on his porch.\n\"I'm delighted that you dropped in.\"\n\nAs though they cared!\n\n\"Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.\" He walked around the room\nquickly, ringing bells. \"I'll have something to drink for you in just\na minute.\"\n\nHe was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But he would be\nuneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in a vague\nway that that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted nothing. A\nlemonade? No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at all,\nthanks. . . . I'm sorry----\n\n\"Did you have a nice ride?\"\n\n\"Very good roads around here.\"\n\n\"I suppose the automobiles----\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nMoved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom who had accepted\nthe introduction as a stranger.\n\n\"I believe we've met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Tom, gruffly polite but obviously not remembering.\n\"So we did. I remember very well.\"\n\n\"About two weeks ago.\"\n\n\"That's right. You were with Nick here.\"\n\n\"I know your wife,\" continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.\n\n\"That so?\"\n\nTom turned to me.\n\n\"You live near here, Nick?\"\n\n\"Next door.\"\n\n\"That so?\"\n\nMr. Sloane didn't enter into the conversation but lounged back haughtily\nin his chair; the woman said nothing either--until unexpectedly, after\ntwo highballs, she became cordial.\n\n\"We'll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,\" she suggested.\n\"What do you say?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I'd be delighted to have you.\"\n\n\"Be ver' nice,\" said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. \"Well--think ought to\nbe starting home.\"\n\n\"Please don't hurry,\" Gatsby urged them. He had control of himself now\nand he wanted to see more of Tom. \"Why don't you--why don't you stay for\nsupper? I wouldn't be surprised if some other people dropped in from\nNew York.\"\n\n\"You come to supper with ME,\" said the lady enthusiastically.\n\"Both of you.\"\n\nThis included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.\n\n\"Come along,\" he said--but to her only.\n\n\"I mean it,\" she insisted. \"I'd love to have you. Lots of room.\"\n\nGatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn't see\nthat Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn't.\n\n\"I'm afraid I won't be able to,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you come,\" she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.\n\nMr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.\n\n\"We won't be late if we start now,\" she insisted aloud.\n\n\"I haven't got a horse,\" said Gatsby. \"I used to ride in the army but\nI've never bought a horse. I'll have to follow you in my car. Excuse me\nfor just a minute.\"\n\nThe rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began\nan impassioned conversation aside.\n\n\"My God, I believe the man's coming,\" said Tom. \"Doesn't he know she\ndoesn't want him?\"\n\n\"She says she does want him.\"\n\n\"She has a big dinner party and he won't know a soul there.\" He frowned.\n\"I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be\nold-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to\nsuit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.\"\n\nSuddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted\ntheir horses.\n\n\"Come on,\" said Mr. Sloane to Tom, \"we're late. We've got to go.\" And then\nto me: \"Tell him we couldn't wait, will you?\"\n\nTom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod and\nthey trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August\nfoliage just as Gatsby with hat and light overcoat in hand came out\nthe front door.\n\nTom was evidently perturbed at Daisy's running around alone, for on the\nfollowing Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby's party. Perhaps\nhis presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness--it\nstands out in my memory from Gatsby's other parties that summer. There\nwere the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same\nprofusion of champagne, the same many-colored, many-keyed commotion,\nbut I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that\nhadn't been there before. Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it,\ngrown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own\nstandards and its own great figures, second to nothing because it had\nno consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at it again,\nthrough Daisy's eyes. It is invariably saddening to look through new\neyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of\nadjustment.\n\nThey arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among the sparkling\nhundreds Daisy's voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.\n\n\"These things excite me SO,\" she whispered. \"If you want to kiss me\nany time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I'll be glad\nto arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card.\nI'm giving out green----\"\n\n\"Look around,\" suggested Gatsby.\n\n\"I'm looking around. I'm having a marvelous----\"\n\n\"You must see the faces of many people you've heard about.\"\n\nTom's arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.\n\n\"We don't go around very much,\" he said. \"In fact I was just thinking\nI don't know a soul here.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you know that lady.\" Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely human\norchid of a woman who sat in state under a white plum tree. Tom and Daisy\nstared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the\nrecognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.\n\n\"She's lovely,\" said Daisy.\n\n\"The man bending over her is her director.\"\n\nHe took them ceremoniously from group to group:\n\n\"Mrs. Buchanan . . . and Mr. Buchanan----\" After an instant's hesitation\nhe added: \"the polo player.\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" objected Tom quickly, \"Not me.\"\n\nBut evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained \"the polo\nplayer\" for the rest of the evening.\n\n\"I've never met so many celebrities!\" Daisy exclaimed. \"I liked that\nman--what was his name?--with the sort of blue nose.\"\n\nGatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.\n\n\"Well, I liked him anyhow.\"\n\n\"I'd a little rather not be the polo player,\" said Tom pleasantly, \"I'd\nrather look at all these famous people in--in oblivion.\"\n\nDaisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful,\nconservative fox-trot--I had never seen him dance before. Then they\nsauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour while\nat her request I remained watchfully in the garden: \"In case there's a\nfire or a flood,\" she explained, \"or any act of God.\"\n\nTom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together.\n\"Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?\" he said. \"A fellow's\ngetting off some funny stuff.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" answered Daisy genially, \"And if you want to take down any\naddresses here's my little gold pencil. . . .\" She looked around after\na moment and told me the girl was \"common but pretty,\" and I knew that\nexcept for the half hour she'd been alone with Gatsby she wasn't having\na good time.\n\nWe were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault--Gatsby had\nbeen called to the phone and I'd enjoyed these same people only two\nweeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now.\n\n\"How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?\"\n\nThe girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my\nshoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.\n\n\"Wha?\"\n\nA massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf\nwith her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker's defence:\n\n\"Oh, she's all right now. When she's had five or six cocktails she always\nstarts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it alone.\"\n\n\"I do leave it alone,\" affirmed the accused hollowly.\n\n\"We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: 'There's somebody\nthat needs your help, Doc.' \"\n\n\"She's much obliged, I'm sure,\" said another friend, without gratitude.\n\"But you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool.\"\n\n\"Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,\" mumbled Miss\nBaedeker. \"They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.\"\n\n\"Then you ought to leave it alone,\" countered Doctor Civet.\n\n\"Speak for yourself!\" cried Miss Baedeker violently. \"Your hand shakes.\nI wouldn't let you operate on me!\"\n\nIt was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with\nDaisy and watching the moving picture director and his Star. They were\nstill under the white plum tree and their faces were touching except\nfor a pale thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he\nhad been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this\nproximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate degree\nand kiss at her cheek.\n\n\"I like her,\" said Daisy, \"I think she's lovely.\"\n\nBut the rest offended her--and inarguably, because it wasn't a gesture but\nan emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented \"place\"\nthat Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village--appalled\nby its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too\nobtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short cut from nothing\nto nothing. She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed\nto understand.\n\nI sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car. It\nwas dark here in front: only the bright door sent ten square feet of\nlight volleying out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a shadow\nmoved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow,\nan indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an\ninvisible glass.\n\n\"Who is this Gatsby anyhow?\" demanded Tom suddenly. \"Some big bootlegger?\"\n\n\"Where'd you hear that?\" I inquired.\n\n\"I didn't hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are\njust big bootleggers, you know.\"\n\n\"Not Gatsby,\" I said shortly.\n\nHe was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under his\nfeet.\n\n\"Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie\ntogether.\"\n\nA breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy's fur collar.\n\n\"At least they're more interesting than the people we know,\" she said\nwith an effort.\n\n\"You didn't look so interested.\"\n\n\"Well, I was.\"\n\nTom laughed and turned to me.\n\n\"Did you notice Daisy's face when that girl asked her to put her under\na cold shower?\"\n\nDaisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper,\nbringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had\nbefore and would never have again. When the melody rose, her voice\nbroke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and\neach change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.\n\n\"Lots of people come who haven't been invited,\" she said suddenly.\n\"That girl hadn't been invited. They simply force their way in and he's\ntoo polite to object.\"\n\n\"I'd like to know who he is and what he does,\" insisted Tom. \"And I think\nI'll make a point of finding out.\"\n\n\"I can tell you right now,\" she answered. \"He owned some drug stores,\na lot of drug stores. He built them up himself.\"\n\nThe dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.\n\n\"Good night, Nick,\" said Daisy.\n\nHer glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps where\n\"Three o'Clock in the Morning,\" a neat, sad little waltz of that year,\nwas drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of\nGatsby's party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from\nher world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling\nher back inside? What would happen now in the dim incalculable hours?\nPerhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare\nand to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with\none fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would blot\nout those five years of unwavering devotion.\n\n\nI stayed late that night. Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free\nand I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run\nup, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights were\nextinguished in the guest rooms overhead. When he came down the steps at\nlast the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes\nwere bright and tired.\n\n\"She didn't like it,\" he said immediately.\n\n\"Of course she did.\"\n\n\"She didn't like it,\" he insisted. \"She didn't have a good time.\"\n\nHe was silent and I guessed at his unutterable depression.\n\n\"I feel far away from her,\" he said. \"It's hard to make her understand.\"\n\n\"You mean about the dance?\"\n\n\"The dance?\" He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of\nhis fingers. \"Old sport, the dance is unimportant.\"\n\nHe wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say:\n\"I never loved you.\" After she had obliterated three years with that\nsentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken.\nOne of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back to\nLouisville and be married from her house--just as if it were five\nyears ago.\n\n\"And she doesn't understand,\" he said. \"She used to be able to\nunderstand. We'd sit for hours----\"\n\nHe broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds\nand discarded favors and crushed flowers.\n\n\"I wouldn't ask too much of her,\" I ventured. \"You can't repeat the past.\"\n\n\"Can't repeat the past?\" he cried incredulously. \"Why of course you can!\"\n\nHe looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the\nshadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.\n\n\"I'm going to fix everything just the way it was before,\" he said,\nnodding determinedly. \"She'll see.\"\n\nHe talked a lot about the past and I gathered that he wanted to recover\nsomething, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy.\nHis life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could\nonce return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he\ncould find out what that thing was. . . .\n\n. . . One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down\nthe street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where\nthere were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight.\nThey stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night\nwith that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of\nthe year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the\ndarkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the\ncorner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalk really\nformed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees--he could\nclimb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the\npap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.\n\nHis heart beat faster and faster as Daisy's white face came up to his\nown. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his\nunutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp\nagain like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer\nto the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed\nher. At his lips' touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the\nincarnation was complete.\n\nThrough all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was\nreminded of something--an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that\nI had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to\ntake shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man's, as though\nthere was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But\nthey made no sound and what I had almost remembered was\nuncommunicable forever.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\n\n\nIt was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights\nin his house failed to go on one Saturday night--and, as obscurely as it\nhad begun, his career as Trimalchio was over.\n\nOnly gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned\nexpectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove\nsulkily away. Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out--an\nunfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously\nfrom the door.\n\n\"Is Mr. Gatsby sick?\"\n\n\"Nope.\" After a pause he added \"sir\" in a dilatory, grudging way.\n\n\"I hadn't seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr. Carraway\ncame over.\"\n\n\"Who?\" he demanded rudely.\n\n\"Carraway.\"\n\n\"Carraway. All right, I'll tell him.\" Abruptly he slammed the door.\n\nMy Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his\nhouse a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never\nwent into West Egg Village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered\nmoderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that the\nkitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village was\nthat the new people weren't servants at all.\n\nNext day Gatsby called me on the phone.\n\n\"Going away?\" I inquired.\n\n\"No, old sport.\"\n\n\"I hear you fired all your servants.\"\n\n\"I wanted somebody who wouldn't gossip. Daisy comes over quite often--in\nthe afternoons.\"\n\nSo the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the\ndisapproval in her eyes.\n\n\"They're some people Wolfsheim wanted to do something for. They're all\nbrothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nHe was calling up at Daisy's request--would I come to lunch at\nher house tomorrow? Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later\nDaisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was coming.\nSomething was up. And yet I couldn't believe that they would choose\nthis occasion for a scene--especially for the rather harrowing scene\nthat Gatsby had outlined in the garden.\n\nThe next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of\nthe summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the\nhot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush\nat noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion;\nthe woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white\nshirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers,\nlapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry. Her pocket-book\nslapped to the floor.\n\n\"Oh, my!\" she gasped.\n\nI picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it\nat arm's length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that\nI had no designs upon it--but every one near by, including the woman,\nsuspected me just the same.\n\n\"Hot!\" said the conductor to familiar faces. \"Some weather! Hot! Hot! Hot!\nIs it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it . . . ?\"\n\nMy commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand.\nThat any one should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed,\nwhose head made damp the pajama pocket over his heart!\n\n. . . Through the hall of the Buchanans' house blew a faint wind,\ncarrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we\nwaited at the door.\n\n\"The master's body!\" roared the butler into the mouthpiece. \"I'm sorry,\nmadame, but we can't furnish it--it's far too hot to touch this noon!\"\n\nWhat he really said was: \"Yes . . . yes . . . I'll see.\"\n\nHe set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to take\nour stiff straw hats.\n\n\"Madame expects you in the salon!\" he cried, needlessly indicating the\ndirection. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the\ncommon store of life.\n\nThe room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and\nJordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols, weighing down\ntheir own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.\n\n\"We can't move,\" they said together.\n\nJordan's fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in\nmine.\n\n\"And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?\" I inquired.\n\nSimultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall\ntelephone.\n\nGatsby stood in the center of the crimson carpet and gazed around with\nfascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting\nlaugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.\n\n\"The rumor is,\" whispered Jordan, \"that that's Tom's girl on the\ntelephone.\"\n\nWe were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance.\n\"Very well, then, I won't sell you the car at all. . . . I'm\nunder no obligations to you at all. . . . And as for your bothering me\nabout it at lunch time I won't stand that at all!\"\n\n\"Holding down the receiver,\" said Daisy cynically.\n\n\"No, he's not,\" I assured her. \"It's a bona fide deal. I happen to\nknow about it.\"\n\nTom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his\nthick body, and hurried into the room.\n\n\"Mr. Gatsby!\" He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed\ndislike. \"I'm glad to see you, sir. . . . Nick. . . .\"\n\n\"Make us a cold drink,\" cried Daisy.\n\nAs he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled\nhis face down kissing him on the mouth.\n\n\"You know I love you,\" she murmured.\n\n\"You forget there's a lady present,\" said Jordan.\n\nDaisy looked around doubtfully.\n\n\"You kiss Nick too.\"\n\n\"What a low, vulgar girl!\"\n\n\"I don't care!\" cried Daisy and began to clog on the brick fireplace.\nThen she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as\na freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.\n\n\"Bles-sed pre-cious,\" she crooned, holding out her arms. \"Come to your\nown mother that loves you.\"\n\nThe child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and rooted\nshyly into her mother's dress.\n\n\"The Bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy\nhair? Stand up now, and say How-de-do.\"\n\nGatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand.\nAfterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don't think he had\never really believed in its existence before.\n\n\"I got dressed before luncheon,\" said the child, turning eagerly to\nDaisy.\n\n\"That's because your mother wanted to show you off.\" Her face bent into\nthe single wrinkle of the small white neck. \"You dream, you. You absolute\nlittle dream.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" admitted the child calmly. \"Aunt Jordan's got on a white\ndress too.\"\n\n\"How do you like mother's friends?\" Daisy turned her around so that she\nfaced Gatsby. \"Do you think they're pretty?\"\n\n\"Where's Daddy?\"\n\n\"She doesn't look like her father,\" explained Daisy. \"She looks like me.\nShe's got my hair and shape of the face.\"\n\nDaisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held\nout her hand.\n\n\"Come, Pammy.\"\n\n\"Goodbye, sweetheart!\"\n\nWith a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her\nnurse's hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back,\npreceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.\n\nGatsby took up his drink.\n\n\"They certainly look cool,\" he said, with visible tension.\n\nWe drank in long greedy swallows.\n\n\"I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter every year,\" said Tom\ngenially. \"It seems that pretty soon the earth's going to fall into the\nsun--or wait a minute--it's just the opposite--the sun's getting colder\nevery year.\n\n\"Come outside,\" he suggested to Gatsby, \"I'd like you to have a look at\nthe place.\"\n\nI went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in the\nheat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea. Gatsby's eyes\nfollowed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay.\n\n\"I'm right across from you.\"\n\n\"So you are.\"\n\nOur eyes lifted over the rosebeds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse\nof the dog days along shore. Slowly the white wings of the boat moved\nagainst the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and\nthe abounding blessed isles.\n\n\"There's sport for you,\" said Tom, nodding. \"I'd like to be out there\nwith him for about an hour.\"\n\nWe had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened, too, against the heat,\nand drank down nervous gayety with the cold ale.\n\n\"What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon,\" cried Daisy, \"and the\nday after that, and the next thirty years?\"\n\n\"Don't be morbid,\" Jordan said. \"Life starts all over again when it gets\ncrisp in the fall.\"\n\n\"But it's so hot,\" insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, \"And\neverything's so confused. Let's all go to town!\"\n\nHer voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding its\nsenselessness into forms.\n\n\"I've heard of making a garage out of a stable,\" Tom was saying to\nGatsby, \"but I'm the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.\"\n\n\"Who wants to go to town?\" demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby's eyes\nfloated toward her. \"Ah,\" she cried, \"you look so cool.\"\n\nTheir eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space.\nWith an effort she glanced down at the table.\n\n\"You always look so cool,\" she repeated.\n\nShe had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was\nastounded. His mouth opened a little and he looked at Gatsby and then\nback at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as some one he knew a\nlong time ago.\n\n\"You resemble the advertisement of the man,\" she went on innocently.\n\"You know the advertisement of the man----\"\n\n\"All right,\" broke in Tom quickly, \"I'm perfectly willing to go to\ntown. Come on--we're all going to town.\"\n\nHe got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife.\nNo one moved.\n\n\"Come on!\" His temper cracked a little. \"What's the matter, anyhow?\nIf we're going to town let's start.\"\n\nHis hand, trembling with his effort at self control, bore to his lips the\nlast of his glass of ale. Daisy's voice got us to our feet and out on\nto the blazing gravel drive.\n\n\"Are we just going to go?\" she objected. \"Like this? Aren't we going to\nlet any one smoke a cigarette first?\"\n\n\"Everybody smoked all through lunch.\"\n\n\"Oh, let's have fun,\" she begged him. \"It's too hot to fuss.\"\n\nHe didn't answer.\n\n\"Have it your own way,\" she said. \"Come on, Jordan.\"\n\nThey went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling\nthe hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon hovered already\nin the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not\nbefore Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.\n\n\"Have you got your stables here?\" asked Gatsby with an effort.\n\n\"About a quarter of a mile down the road.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"I don't see the idea of going to town,\" broke out Tom savagely.\n\"Women get these notions in their heads----\"\n\n\"Shall we take anything to drink?\" called Daisy from an upper window.\n\n\"I'll get some whiskey,\" answered Tom. He went inside.\n\nGatsby turned to me rigidly:\n\n\"I can't say anything in his house, old sport.\"\n\n\"She's got an indiscreet voice,\" I remarked. \"It's full of----\"\n\nI hesitated.\n\n\"Her voice is full of money,\" he said suddenly.\n\nThat was it. I'd never understood before. It was full of money--that was\nthe inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the\ncymbals' song of it. . . . High in a white palace the king's daughter,\nthe golden girl. . . .\n\nTom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed\nby Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and\ncarrying light capes over their arms.\n\n\"Shall we all go in my car?\" suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green\nleather of the seat. \"I ought to have left it in the shade.\"\n\n\"Is it standard shift?\" demanded Tom.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, you take my coup\u00e9 and let me drive your car to town.\"\n\nThe suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.\n\n\"I don't think there's much gas,\" he objected.\n\n\"Plenty of gas,\" said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge.\n\"And if it runs out I can stop at a drug store. You can buy anything at a\ndrug store nowadays.\"\n\nA pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom\nfrowning and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar\nand vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in words,\npassed over Gatsby's face.\n\n\"Come on, Daisy,\" said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby's\ncar. \"I'll take you in this circus wagon.\"\n\nHe opened the door but she moved out from the circle of his arm.\n\n\"You take Nick and Jordan. We'll follow you in the coup\u00e9.\"\n\nShe walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan and\nTom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby's car, Tom pushed the\nunfamiliar gears tentatively and we shot off into the oppressive heat\nleaving them out of sight behind.\n\n\"Did you see that?\" demanded Tom.\n\n\"See what?\"\n\nHe looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known all\nalong.\n\n\"You think I'm pretty dumb, don't you?\" he suggested. \"Perhaps I am, but\nI have a--almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do.\nMaybe you don't believe that, but science----\"\n\nHe paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back from\nthe edge of the theoretical abyss.\n\n\"I've made a small investigation of this fellow,\" he continued. \"I could\nhave gone deeper if I'd known----\"\n\n\"Do you mean you've been to a medium?\" inquired Jordan humorously.\n\n\"What?\" Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. \"A medium?\"\n\n\"About Gatsby.\"\n\n\"About Gatsby! No, I haven't. I said I'd been making a small\ninvestigation of his past.\"\n\n\"And you found he was an Oxford man,\" said Jordan helpfully.\n\n\"An Oxford man!\" He was incredulous. \"Like hell he is! He wears a\npink suit.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless he's an Oxford man.\"\n\n\"Oxford, New Mexico,\" snorted Tom contemptuously, \"or something like\nthat.\"\n\n\"Listen, Tom. If you're such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?\"\ndemanded Jordan crossly.\n\n\"Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married--God knows\nwhere!\"\n\nWe were all irritable now with the fading ale and, aware of it,\nwe drove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg's faded\neyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby's caution about\ngasoline.\n\n\"We've got enough to get us to town,\" said Tom.\n\n\"But there's a garage right here,\" objected Jordan. \"I don't want to get\nstalled in this baking heat.\"\n\nTom threw on both brakes impatiently and we slid to an abrupt\ndusty stop under Wilson's sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged\nfrom the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.\n\n\"Let's have some gas!\" cried Tom roughly. \"What do you think we stopped\nfor--to admire the view?\"\n\n\"I'm sick,\" said Wilson without moving. \"I been sick all day.\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"I'm all run down.\"\n\n\"Well, shall I help myself?\" Tom demanded. \"You sounded well enough\non the phone.\"\n\nWith an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and,\nbreathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his face\nwas green.\n\n\"I didn't mean to interrupt your lunch,\" he said. \"But I need money\npretty bad and I was wondering what you were going to do with your\nold car.\"\n\n\"How do you like this one?\" inquired Tom. \"I bought it last week.\"\n\n\"It's a nice yellow one,\" said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.\n\n\"Like to buy it?\"\n\n\"Big chance,\" Wilson smiled faintly. \"No, but I could make some money\non the other.\"\n\n\"What do you want money for, all of a sudden?\"\n\n\"I've been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to\ngo west.\"\n\n\"Your wife does!\" exclaimed Tom, startled.\n\n\"She's been talking about it for ten years.\" He rested for a moment\nagainst the pump, shading his eyes. \"And now she's going whether she wants\nto or not. I'm going to get her away.\"\n\nThe coup\u00e9 flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a\nwaving hand.\n\n\"What do I owe you?\" demanded Tom harshly.\n\n\"I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,\" remarked\nWilson. \"That's why I want to get away. That's why I been bothering you\nabout the car.\"\n\n\"What do I owe you?\"\n\n\"Dollar twenty.\"\n\nThe relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had\na bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions\nhadn't alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some\nsort of life apart from him in another world and the shock had\nmade him physically sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made\na parallel discovery less than an hour before--and it occurred to me\nthat there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so\nprofound as the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so\nsick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty--as if he had just got\nsome poor girl with child.\n\n\"I'll let you have that car,\" said Tom. \"I'll send it over tomorrow\nafternoon.\"\n\nThat locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad\nglare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been\nwarned of something behind. Over the ashheaps the giant eyes of\nDoctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil but I perceived, after\na moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity\nfrom less than twenty feet away.\n\nIn one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside\na little and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So engrossed\nwas she that she had no consciousness of being observed and one\nemotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly\ndeveloping picture. Her expression was curiously familiar--it was an\nexpression I had often seen on women's faces but on Myrtle Wilson's\nface it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her\neyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan\nBaker, whom she took to be his wife.\n\n\nThere is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we\ndrove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his\nmistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping\nprecipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the\naccelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving\nWilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour,\nuntil, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of\nthe easygoing blue coup\u00e9.\n\n\"Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,\" suggested Jordan.\n\"I love New York on summer afternoons when every one's away. There's\nsomething very sensuous about it--overripe, as if all sorts of funny\nfruits were going to fall into your hands.\"\n\nThe word \"sensuous\" had the effect of further disquieting Tom but before\nhe could invent a protest the coup\u00e9 came to a stop and Daisy signalled us\nto draw up alongside.\n\n\"Where are we going?\" she cried.\n\n\"How about the movies?\"\n\n\"It's so hot,\" she complained. \"You go. We'll ride around and meet you\nafter.\" With an effort her wit rose faintly, \"We'll meet you on some\ncorner. I'll be the man smoking two cigarettes.\"\n\n\"We can't argue about it here,\" Tom said impatiently as a truck gave\nout a cursing whistle behind us. \"You follow me to the south side of\nCentral Park, in front of the Plaza.\"\n\nSeveral times he turned his head and looked back for their car,\nand if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into\nsight. I think he was afraid they would dart down a side street and out\nof his life forever.\n\nBut they didn't. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging\nthe parlor of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.\n\nThe prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into\nthat room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the\ncourse of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my\nlegs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back. The\nnotion originated with Daisy's suggestion that we hire five bathrooms\nand take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as \"a place to\nhave a mint julep.\" Each of us said over and over that it was a \"crazy\nidea\"--we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or\npretended to think, that we were being very funny. . . .\n\nThe room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four\no'clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from\nthe Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us,\nfixing her hair.\n\n\"It's a swell suite,\" whispered Jordan respectfully and every one\nlaughed.\n\n\"Open another window,\" commanded Daisy, without turning around.\n\n\"There aren't any more.\"\n\n\"Well, we'd better telephone for an axe----\"\n\n\"The thing to do is to forget about the heat,\" said Tom impatiently.\n\"You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.\"\n\nHe unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the towel and put it on the table.\n\n\"Why not let her alone, old sport?\" remarked Gatsby. \"You're the one that\nwanted to come to town.\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its nail\nand splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered \"Excuse me\"--but\nthis time no one laughed.\n\n\"I'll pick it up,\" I offered.\n\n\"I've got it.\" Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered \"Hum!\" in an\ninterested way, and tossed the book on a chair.\n\n\"That's a great expression of yours, isn't it?\" said Tom sharply.\n\n\"What is?\"\n\n\"All this 'old sport' business. Where'd you pick that up?\"\n\n\"Now see here, Tom,\" said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, \"if\nyou're going to make personal remarks I won't stay here a minute. Call\nup and order some ice for the mint julep.\"\n\nAs Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and\nwe were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn's Wedding March\nfrom the ballroom below.\n\n\"Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!\" cried Jordan dismally.\n\n\"Still--I was married in the middle of June,\" Daisy remembered,\n\"Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?\"\n\n\"Biloxi,\" he answered shortly.\n\n\"A man named Biloxi. 'Blocks' Biloxi, and he made boxes--that's a\nfact--and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.\"\n\n\"They carried him into my house,\" appended Jordan, \"because we lived\njust two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy\ntold him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died.\" After a\nmoment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, \"There\nwasn't any connection.\"\n\n\"I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,\" I remarked.\n\n\"That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left.\nHe gave me an aluminum putter that I use today.\"\n\nThe music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated\nin at the window, followed by intermittent cries of \"Yea--ea--ea!\"\nand finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.\n\n\"We're getting old,\" said Daisy. \"If we were young we'd rise and dance.\"\n\n\"Remember Biloxi,\" Jordan warned her. \"Where'd you know him, Tom?\"\n\n\"Biloxi?\" He concentrated with an effort. \"I didn't know him. He was a\nfriend of Daisy's.\"\n\n\"He was not,\" she denied. \"I'd never seen him before. He came down in\nthe private car.\"\n\n\"Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville.\nAsa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room\nfor him.\"\n\nJordan smiled.\n\n\"He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of\nyour class at Yale.\"\n\nTom and I looked at each other blankly.\n\n\"BilOxi?\"\n\n\"First place, we didn't have any president----\"\n\nGatsby's foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.\n\n\"By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you're an Oxford man.\"\n\n\"Not exactly.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.\"\n\n\"Yes--I went there.\"\n\nA pause. Then Tom's voice, incredulous and insulting:\n\n\"You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.\"\n\nAnother pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but\nthe silence was unbroken by his \"Thank you\" and the soft closing of the\ndoor. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.\n\n\"I told you I went there,\" said Gatsby.\n\n\"I heard you, but I'd like to know when.\"\n\n\"It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That's why I\ncan't really call myself an Oxford man.\"\n\nTom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all\nlooking at Gatsby.\n\n\"It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the\nArmistice,\" he continued. \"We could go to any of the universities in\nEngland or France.\"\n\nI wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those renewals\nof complete faith in him that I'd experienced before.\n\nDaisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.\n\n\"Open the whiskey, Tom,\" she ordered. \"And I'll make you a mint julep.\nThen you won't seem so stupid to yourself. . . . Look at the mint!\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" snapped Tom, \"I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more\nquestion.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" Gatsby said politely.\n\n\"What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?\"\n\nThey were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.\n\n\"He isn't causing a row.\" Daisy looked desperately from one to the\nother. \"You're causing a row. Please have a little self control.\"\n\n\"Self control!\" repeated Tom incredulously. \"I suppose the latest thing\nis to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife.\nWell, if that's the idea you can count me out. . . . Nowadays people begin\nby sneering at family life and family institutions and next they'll\nthrow everything overboard and have intermarriage between black\nand white.\"\n\nFlushed with his impassioned gibberish he saw himself standing alone on\nthe last barrier of civilization.\n\n\"We're all white here,\" murmured Jordan.\n\n\"I know I'm not very popular. I don't give big parties. I suppose\nyou've got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any\nfriends--in the modern world.\"\n\nAngry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened\nhis mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so complete.\n\n\"I've got something to tell YOU, old sport,----\" began Gatsby. But Daisy\nguessed at his intention.\n\n\"Please don't!\" she interrupted helplessly. \"Please let's all go home.\nWhy don't we all go home?\"\n\n\"That's a good idea.\" I got up. \"Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.\"\n\n\"I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.\"\n\n\"Your wife doesn't love you,\" said Gatsby. \"She's never loved you.\nShe loves me.\"\n\n\"You must be crazy!\" exclaimed Tom automatically.\n\nGatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.\n\n\"She never loved you, do you hear?\" he cried. \"She only married you\nbecause I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible\nmistake, but in her heart she never loved any one except me!\"\n\nAt this point Jordan and I tried to go but Tom and Gatsby insisted with\ncompetitive firmness that we remain--as though neither of them had\nanything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously\nof their emotions.\n\n\"Sit down Daisy.\" Tom's voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal\nnote. \"What's been going on? I want to hear all about it.\"\n\n\"I told you what's been going on,\" said Gatsby. \"Going on for five\nyears--and you didn't know.\"\n\nTom turned to Daisy sharply.\n\n\"You've been seeing this fellow for five years?\"\n\n\"Not seeing,\" said Gatsby. \"No, we couldn't meet. But both of us loved\neach other all that time, old sport, and you didn't know. I used to laugh\nsometimes--\"but there was no laughter in his eyes, \"to think that you\ndidn't know.\"\n\n\"Oh--that's all.\" Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman\nand leaned back in his chair.\n\n\"You're crazy!\" he exploded. \"I can't speak about what happened five years\nago, because I didn't know Daisy then--and I'll be damned if I see how you\ngot within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back\ndoor. But all the rest of that's a God Damned lie. Daisy loved me when\nshe married me and she loves me now.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Gatsby, shaking his head.\n\n\"She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas\nin her head and doesn't know what she's doing.\" He nodded sagely. \"And\nwhat's more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree\nand make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I\nlove her all the time.\"\n\n\"You're revolting,\" said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice,\ndropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: \"Do you\nknow why we left Chicago? I'm surprised that they didn't treat you to\nthe story of that little spree.\"\n\nGatsby walked over and stood beside her.\n\n\"Daisy, that's all over now,\" he said earnestly. \"It doesn't matter any\nmore. Just tell him the truth--that you never loved him--and it's all\nwiped out forever.\"\n\nShe looked at him blindly. \"Why,--how could I love him--possibly?\"\n\n\"You never loved him.\"\n\nShe hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal,\nas though she realized at last what she was doing--and as though she had\nnever, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done now.\nIt was too late.\n\n\"I never loved him,\" she said, with perceptible reluctance.\n\n\"Not at Kapiolani?\" demanded Tom suddenly.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nFrom the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up\non hot waves of air.\n\n\"Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes\ndry?\" There was a husky tenderness in his tone. \". . . Daisy?\"\n\n\"Please don't.\" Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it.\nShe looked at Gatsby. \"There, Jay,\" she said--but her hand as she tried\nto light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette and\nthe burning match on the carpet.\n\n\"Oh, you want too much!\" she cried to Gatsby. \"I love you now--isn't that\nenough? I can't help what's past.\" She began to sob helplessly.\n\"I did love him once--but I loved you too.\"\n\nGatsby's eyes opened and closed.\n\n\"You loved me TOO?\" he repeated.\n\n\"Even that's a lie,\" said Tom savagely. \"She didn't know you were alive.\nWhy,--there're things between Daisy and me that you'll never know,\nthings that neither of us can ever forget.\"\n\nThe words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.\n\n\"I want to speak to Daisy alone,\" he insisted. \"She's all excited now----\"\n\n\"Even alone I can't say I never loved Tom,\" she admitted in a pitiful\nvoice. \"It wouldn't be true.\"\n\n\"Of course it wouldn't,\" agreed Tom.\n\nShe turned to her husband.\n\n\"As if it mattered to you,\" she said.\n\n\"Of course it matters. I'm going to take better care of you from now on.\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. \"You're not\ngoing to take care of her any more.\"\n\n\"I'm not?\" Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to\ncontrol himself now. \"Why's that?\"\n\n\"Daisy's leaving you.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\n\"I am, though,\" she said with a visible effort.\n\n\"She's not leaving me!\" Tom's words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby.\n\"Certainly not for a common swindler who'd have to steal the ring he\nput on her finger.\"\n\n\"I won't stand this!\" cried Daisy. \"Oh, please let's get out.\"\n\n\"Who are you, anyhow?\" broke out Tom. \"You're one of that bunch that\nhangs around with Meyer Wolfsheim--that much I happen to know. I've made\na little investigation into your affairs--and I'll carry it further\ntomorrow.\"\n\n\"You can suit yourself about that, old sport.\" said Gatsby steadily.\n\n\"I found out what your 'drug stores' were.\" He turned to us and spoke\nrapidly. \"He and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of side-street drug stores\nhere and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. That's one of\nhis little stunts. I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw\nhim and I wasn't far wrong.\"\n\n\"What about it?\" said Gatsby politely. \"I guess your friend Walter Chase\nwasn't too proud to come in on it.\"\n\n\"And you left him in the lurch, didn't you? You let him go to jail for\na month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the subject\nof YOU.\"\n\n\"He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old\nsport.\"\n\n\"Don't you call me 'old sport'!\" cried Tom. Gatsby said nothing.\n\"Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfsheim scared\nhim into shutting his mouth.\"\n\nThat unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby's face.\n\n\"That drug store business was just small change,\" continued Tom slowly,\n\"but you've got something on now that Walter's afraid to tell me\nabout.\"\n\nI glanced at Daisy who was staring terrified between Gatsby\nand her husband and at Jordan who had begun to balance an invisible\nbut absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to\nGatsby--and was startled at his expression. He looked--and this is said\nin all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden--as if he had\n\"killed a man.\" For a moment the set of his face could be described in\njust that fantastic way.\n\nIt passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything,\ndefending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with\nevery word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave\nthat up and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped\naway, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling\nunhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.\n\nThe voice begged again to go.\n\n\"PLEASE, Tom! I can't stand this any more.\"\n\nHer frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage\nshe had had, were definitely gone.\n\n\"You two start on home, Daisy,\" said Tom. \"In Mr. Gatsby's car.\"\n\nShe looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous scorn.\n\n\"Go on. He won't annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous\nlittle flirtation is over.\"\n\nThey were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental, isolated,\nlike ghosts even from our pity.\n\nAfter a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of\nwhiskey in the towel.\n\n\"Want any of this stuff? Jordan? . . . Nick?\"\n\nI didn't answer.\n\n\"Nick?\" He asked again.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Want any?\"\n\n\"No . . . I just remembered that today's my birthday.\"\n\nI was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous menacing road of a\nnew decade.\n\nIt was seven o'clock when we got into the coup\u00e9 with him and started\nfor Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but his\nvoice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamor on the\nsidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead. Human sympathy\nhas its limits and we were content to let all their tragic arguments\nfade with the city lights behind. Thirty--the promise of a decade\nof loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning\nbrief-case of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside\nme who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten\ndreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face\nfell lazily against my coat's shoulder and the formidable stroke of\nthirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.\n\nSo we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.\n\n\nThe young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the\nashheaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had slept through\nthe heat until after five, when he strolled over to the garage and\nfound George Wilson sick in his office--really sick, pale as his own\npale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go to bed but\nWilson refused, saying that he'd miss a lot of business if he did.\nWhile his neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke\nout overhead.\n\n\"I've got my wife locked in up there,\" explained Wilson calmly.\n\"She's going to stay there till the day after tomorrow and then we're\ngoing to move away.\"\n\nMichaelis was astonished; they had been neighbors for four years and\nWilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement. Generally\nhe was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn't working he sat on a\nchair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed\nalong the road. When any one spoke to him he invariably laughed in an\nagreeable, colorless way. He was his wife's man and not his own.\n\nSo naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson\nwouldn't say a word--instead he began to throw curious, suspicious\nglances at his visitor and ask him what he'd been doing at certain\ntimes on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy some\nworkmen came past the door bound for his restaurant and Michaelis took\nthe opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he didn't.\nHe supposed he forgot to, that's all. When he came outside again\na little after seven he was reminded of the conversation because he\nheard Mrs. Wilson's voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in the garage.\n\n\"Beat me!\" he heard her cry. \"Throw me down and beat me, you dirty\nlittle coward!\"\n\nA moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and\nshouting; before he could move from his door the business was over.\n\nThe \"death car\" as the newspapers called it, didn't stop; it came out\nof the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment and then\ndisappeared around the next bend. Michaelis wasn't even sure of its\ncolor--he told the first policeman that it was light green. The other\ncar, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards\nbeyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life\nviolently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick, dark\nblood with the dust.\n\nMichaelis and this man reached her first but when they had torn open\nher shirtwaist still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left\nbreast was swinging loose like a flap and there was no need to listen\nfor the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped at the\ncorners as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous\nvitality she had stored so long.\n\n\nWe saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still\nsome distance away.\n\n\"Wreck!\" said Tom. \"That's good. Wilson'll have a little business\nat last.\"\n\nHe slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping until,\nas we came nearer, the hushed intent faces of the people at the garage\ndoor made him automatically put on the brakes.\n\n\"We'll take a look,\" he said doubtfully, \"just a look.\"\n\nI became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly\nfrom the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coup\u00e9 and walked\ntoward the door resolved itself into the words \"Oh, my God!\" uttered over\nand over in a gasping moan.\n\n\"There's some bad trouble here,\" said Tom excitedly.\n\nHe reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the\ngarage which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging wire basket\noverhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat and with a violent\nthrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through.\n\nThe circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it\nwas a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals\ndisarranged the line and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.\n\nMyrtle Wilson's body wrapped in a blanket and then in another\nblanket as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night lay on a\nwork table by the wall and Tom, with his back to us, was bending over\nit, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down\nnames with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I\ncouldn't find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed\nclamorously through the bare garage--then I saw Wilson standing on the\nraised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to\nthe doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low\nvoice and attempting from time to time to lay a hand on his shoulder,\nbut Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly from the\nswinging light to the laden table by the wall and then jerk back to\nthe light again and he gave out incessantly his high horrible call.\n\n\"O, my Ga-od! O, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!\"\n\nPresently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and after staring around the\ngarage with glazed eyes addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the\npoliceman.\n\n\"M-a-v--\" the policeman was saying, \"--o----\"\n\n\"No,--r--\" corrected the man, \"M-a-v-r-o----\"\n\n\"Listen to me!\" muttered Tom fiercely.\n\n\"r--\" said the policeman, \"o----\"\n\n\"g----\"\n\n\"g--\" He looked up as Tom's broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder.\n\"What you want, fella?\"\n\n\"What happened--that's what I want to know!\"\n\n\"Auto hit her. Ins'antly killed.\"\n\n\"Instantly killed,\" repeated Tom, staring.\n\n\"She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn't even stopus car.\"\n\n\"There was two cars,\" said Michaelis, \"one comin', one goin', see?\"\n\n\"Going where?\" asked the policeman keenly.\n\n\"One goin' each way. Well, she--\" His hand rose toward the blankets but\nstopped half way and fell to his side, \"--she ran out there an' the one\ncomin' from N'York knock right into her goin' thirty or forty miles an\nhour.\"\n\n\"What's the name of this place here?\" demanded the officer.\n\n\"Hasn't got any name.\"\n\nA pale, well-dressed Negro stepped near.\n\n\"It was a yellow car,\" he said, \"big yellow car. New.\"\n\n\"See the accident?\" asked the policeman.\n\n\"No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster'n forty. Going\nfifty, sixty.\"\n\n\"Come here and let's have your name. Look out now. I want to get his\nname.\"\n\nSome words of this conversation must have reached Wilson swaying\nin the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among\nhis gasping cries.\n\n\"You don't have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of\ncar it was!\"\n\nWatching Tom I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten\nunder his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and standing\nin front of him seized him firmly by the upper arms.\n\n\"You've got to pull yourself together,\" he said with soothing\ngruffness.\n\nWilson's eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then\nwould have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.\n\n\"Listen,\" said Tom, shaking him a little. \"I just got here a minute ago,\nfrom New York. I was bringing you that coup\u00e9 we've been talking about.\nThat yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn't mine, do you hear? I\nhaven't seen it all afternoon.\"\n\nOnly the Negro and I were near enough to hear what he said but the\npoliceman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent\neyes.\n\n\"What's all that?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I'm a friend of his.\" Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on\nWilson's body. \"He says he knows the car that did it. . . . It was a yellow\ncar.\"\n\nSome dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.\n\n\"And what color's your car?\"\n\n\"It's a blue car, a coup\u00e9.\"\n\n\"We've come straight from New York,\" I said.\n\nSome one who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this and\nthe policeman turned away.\n\n\"Now, if you'll let me have that name again correct----\"\n\nPicking up Wilson like a doll Tom carried him into the office,\nset him down in a chair and came back.\n\n\"If somebody'll come here and sit with him!\" he snapped\nauthoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced\nat each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the\ndoor on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the\ntable. As he passed close to me he whispered \"Let's get out.\"\n\nSelf consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we\npushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor,\ncase in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.\n\nTom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend--then his foot came down\nhard and the coup\u00e9 raced along through the night. In a little while I\nheard a low husky sob and saw that the tears were overflowing down his\nface.\n\n\"The God Damn coward!\" he whimpered. \"He didn't even stop his car.\"\n\n\nThe Buchanans' house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling\ntrees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor\nwhere two windows bloomed with light among the vines.\n\n\"Daisy's home,\" he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and\nfrowned slightly.\n\n\"I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There's nothing we can\ndo tonight.\"\n\nA change had come over him and he spoke gravely, and with decision.\nAs we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of\nthe situation in a few brisk phrases.\n\n\"I'll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you're waiting\nyou and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some\nsupper--if you want any.\" He opened the door. \"Come in.\"\n\n\"No thanks. But I'd be glad if you'd order me the taxi. I'll wait\noutside.\"\n\nJordan put her hand on my arm.\n\n\"Won't you come in, Nick?\"\n\n\"No thanks.\"\n\nI was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan lingered\nfor a moment more.\n\n\"It's only half past nine,\" she said.\n\nI'd be damned if I'd go in; I'd had enough of all of them for one day\nand suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of\nthis in my expression for she turned abruptly away and ran up the\nporch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head\nin my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler's\nvoice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the\nhouse intending to wait by the gate.\n\nI hadn't gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from\nbetween two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird by that\ntime because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his\npink suit under the moon.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Just standing here, old sport.\"\n\nSomehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was going\nto rob the house in a moment; I wouldn't have been surprised to see\nsinister faces, the faces of \"Wolfsheim's people,\" behind him in the\ndark shrubbery.\n\n\"Did you see any trouble on the road?\" he asked after a minute.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe hesitated.\n\n\"Was she killed?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It's better that the shock\nshould all come at once. She stood it pretty well.\"\n\nHe spoke as if Daisy's reaction was the only thing that mattered.\n\n\"I got to West Egg by a side road,\" he went on, \"and left the car in my\ngarage. I don't think anybody saw us but of course I can't be sure.\"\n\nI disliked him so much by this time that I didn't find it necessary to\ntell him he was wrong.\n\n\"Who was the woman?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it\nhappen?\"\n\n\"Well, I tried to swing the wheel----\" He broke off, and suddenly I\nguessed at the truth.\n\n\"Was Daisy driving?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said after a moment, \"but of course I'll say I was. You see,\nwhen we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would\nsteady her to drive--and this woman rushed out at us just as we were\npassing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute but it\nseemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody\nshe knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other\ncar, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second my hand\nreached the wheel I felt the shock--it must have killed her instantly.\"\n\n\"It ripped her open----\"\n\n\"Don't tell me, old sport.\" He winced. \"Anyhow--Daisy stepped on it.\nI tried to make her stop, but she couldn't so I pulled on the emergency\nbrake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.\n\n\"She'll be all right tomorrow,\" he said presently. \"I'm just going to\nwait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness\nthis afternoon. She's locked herself into her room and if he tries any\nbrutality she's going to turn the light out and on again.\"\n\n\"He won't touch her,\" I said. \"He's not thinking about her.\"\n\n\"I don't trust him, old sport.\"\n\n\"How long are you going to wait?\"\n\n\"All night if necessary. Anyhow till they all go to bed.\"\n\nA new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had\nbeen driving. He might think he saw a connection in it--he might think\nanything. I looked at the house: there were two or three bright windows\ndownstairs and the pink glow from Daisy's room on the second floor.\n\n\"You wait here,\" I said. \"I'll see if there's any sign of a commotion.\"\n\nI walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly\nand tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains were open,\nand I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where we had dined\nthat June night three months before I came to a small rectangle of light\nwhich I guessed was the pantry window. The blind was drawn but I found\na rift at the sill.\n\nDaisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table\nwith a plate of cold fried chicken between them and two bottles of\nale. He was talking intently across the table at her and in his\nearnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a\nwhile she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.\n\nThey weren't happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the\nale--and yet they weren't unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air\nof natural intimacy about the picture and anybody would have said that\nthey were conspiring together.\n\nAs I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the\ndark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in\nthe drive.\n\n\"Is it all quiet up there?\" he asked anxiously.\n\n\"Yes, it's all quiet.\" I hesitated. \"You'd better come home and get\nsome sleep.\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.\"\n\nHe put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his\nscrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of\nthe vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the\nmoonlight--watching over nothing.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\n\n\nI couldn't sleep all night; a fog-horn was groaning incessantly on the\nSound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage\nfrightening dreams. Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby's drive\nand immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress--I felt that I\nhad something to tell him, something to warn him about and morning\nwould be too late.\n\nCrossing his lawn I saw that his front door was still open and he was\nleaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.\n\n\"Nothing happened,\" he said wanly. \"I waited, and about four o'clock she\ncame to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out\nthe light.\"\n\nHis house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we\nhunted through the great rooms for cigarettes. We pushed aside curtains\nthat were like pavilions and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for\nelectric light switches--once I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the\nkeys of a ghostly piano. There was an inexplicable amount of dust\neverywhere and the rooms were musty as though they hadn't been aired for\nmany days. I found the humidor on an unfamiliar table with two stale dry\ncigarettes inside. Throwing open the French windows of the\ndrawing-room we sat smoking out into the darkness.\n\n\"You ought to go away,\" I said. \"It's pretty certain they'll trace\nyour car.\"\n\n\"Go away NOW, old sport?\"\n\n\"Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal.\"\n\nHe wouldn't consider it. He couldn't possibly leave Daisy until he knew\nwhat she was going to do. He was clutching at some last hope and I\ncouldn't bear to shake him free.\n\nIt was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with\nDan Cody--told it to me because \"Jay Gatsby\" had broken up like glass\nagainst Tom's hard malice and the long secret extravaganza was played\nout. I think that he would have acknowledged anything, now, without\nreserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.\n\nShe was the first \"nice\" girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed\ncapacities he had come in contact with such people but always\nwith indiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly\ndesirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers\nfrom Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him--he had never been\nin such a beautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless\nintensity was that Daisy lived there--it was as casual a thing to her\nas his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it,\na hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other\nbedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its\ncorridors and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in\nlavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year's shining\nmotor cars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered. It\nexcited him too that many men had already loved Daisy--it increased\nher value in his eyes. He felt their presence all about the house,\npervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.\n\nBut he knew that he was in Daisy's house by a colossal accident.\nHowever glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a\npenniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible\ncloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he made\nthe most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and\nunscrupulously--eventually he took Daisy one still October night,\ntook her because he had no real right to touch her hand.\n\nHe might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under\nfalse pretenses. I don't mean that he had traded on his phantom\nmillions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he\nlet her believe that he was a person from much the same stratum as\nherself--that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of\nfact he had no such facilities--he had no comfortable family standing\nbehind him and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government\nto be blown anywhere about the world.\n\nBut he didn't despise himself and it didn't turn out as he had\nimagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go--but\nnow he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail.\nHe knew that Daisy was extraordinary but he didn't realize just how\nextraordinary a \"nice\" girl could be. She vanished into her rich\nhouse, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby--nothing. He felt\nmarried to her, that was all.\n\nWhen they met again two days later it was Gatsby who was breathless,\nwho was somehow betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought\nluxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably\nas she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth.\nShe had caught a cold and it made her voice huskier and more charming\nthan ever and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery\nthat wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes\nand of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot\nstruggles of the poor.\n\n\n\"I can't describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her,\nold sport. I even hoped for a while that she'd throw me over, but she\ndidn't, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot\nbecause I knew different things from her. . . . Well, there I was,\nway off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and\nall of a sudden I didn't care. What was the use of doing great\nthings if I could have a better time telling her what I was going\nto do?\"\n\nOn the last afternoon before he went abroad he sat with Daisy in\nhis arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day with fire\nin the room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he\nchanged his arm a little and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The\nafternoon had made them tranquil for a while as if to give them a deep\nmemory for the long parting the next day promised. They had never been\ncloser in their month of love nor communicated more profoundly one\nwith another than when she brushed silent lips against his coat's\nshoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though\nshe were asleep.\n\n\nHe did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before he went\nto the front and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and\nthe command of the divisional machine guns. After the Armistice\nhe tried frantically to get home but some complication or\nmisunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now--there\nwas a quality of nervous despair in Daisy's letters. She didn't see why\nhe couldn't come. She was feeling the pressure of the world outside\nand she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be\nreassured that she was doing the right thing after all.\n\nFor Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids\nand pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of\nthe year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new\ntunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the\n\"Beale Street Blues\" while a hundred pairs of golden and silver\nslippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were\nalways rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low sweet fever,\nwhile fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the\nsad horns around the floor.\n\nThrough this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the\nseason; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with\nhalf a dozen men and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and\nchiffon of an evening dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor\nbeside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a\ndecision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately--and the decision\nmust be made by some force--of love, of money, of unquestionable\npracticality--that was close at hand.\n\nThat force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom\nBuchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his\nposition and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certain\nstruggle and a certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby while he was\nstill at Oxford.\n\n\nIt was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of\nthe windows downstairs, filling the house with grey turning,\ngold turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew\nand ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a\nslow pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool\nlovely day.\n\n\"I don't think she ever loved him.\" Gatsby turned around from a window\nand looked at me challengingly. \"You must remember, old sport, she was\nvery excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that\nfrightened her--that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper.\nAnd the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.\"\n\nHe sat down gloomily.\n\n\"Of course she might have loved him, just for a minute, when they were\nfirst married--and loved me more even then, do you see?\"\n\nSuddenly he came out with a curious remark:\n\n\"In any case,\" he said, \"it was just personal.\"\n\nWhat could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in\nhis conception of the affair that couldn't be measured?\n\nHe came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding\ntrip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville\non the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week, walking the\nstreets where their footsteps had clicked together through the\nNovember night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which\nthey had driven in her white car. Just as Daisy's house had always\nseemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses so his\nidea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded\nwith a melancholy beauty.\n\nHe left feeling that if he had searched harder he might have found\nher--that he was leaving her behind. The day-coach--he was penniless\nnow--was hot. He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a\nfolding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar\nbuildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow\ntrolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have\nseen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.\n\nThe track curved and now it was going away from the sun which, as it\nsank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing\ncity where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand\ndesperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of\nthe spot that she had made lovely for him. But it was all going by too\nfast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of\nit, the freshest and the best, forever.\n\n\nIt was nine o'clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the\nporch. The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there\nwas an autumn flavor in the air. The gardener, the last one of Gatsby's\nformer servants, came to the foot of the steps.\n\n\"I'm going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. Leaves'll start falling\npretty soon and then there's always trouble with the pipes.\"\n\n\"Don't do it today,\" Gatsby answered. He turned to me apologetically.\n\"You know, old sport, I've never used that pool all summer?\"\n\nI looked at my watch and stood up.\n\n\"Twelve minutes to my train.\"\n\nI didn't want to go to the city. I wasn't worth a decent stroke of work\nbut it was more than that--I didn't want to leave Gatsby. I missed that\ntrain, and then another, before I could get myself away.\n\n\"I'll call you up,\" I said finally.\n\n\"Do, old sport.\"\n\n\"I'll call you about noon.\"\n\nWe walked slowly down the steps.\n\n\"I suppose Daisy'll call too.\" He looked at me anxiously as if he\nhoped I'd corroborate this.\n\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\n\"Well--goodbye.\"\n\nWe shook hands and I started away. Just before I reached the hedge I\nremembered something and turned around.\n\n\"They're a rotten crowd,\" I shouted across the lawn. \"You're worth the\nwhole damn bunch put together.\"\n\nI've always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever gave\nhim, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end. First he nodded\npolitely, and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding\nsmile, as if we'd been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time.\nHis gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of color against the\nwhite steps and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral\nhome three months before. The lawn and drive had been crowded with the\nfaces of those who guessed at his corruption--and he had stood on those\nsteps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye.\n\nI thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thanking him for\nthat--I and the others.\n\n\"Goodbye,\" I called. \"I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.\"\n\n\nUp in the city I tried for a while to list the quotations on an\ninterminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair.\nJust before noon the phone woke me and I started up with sweat\nbreaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker; she often called\nme up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements\nbetween hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find\nin any other way. Usually her voice came over the wire as something\nfresh and cool as if a divot from a green golf links had come\nsailing in at the office window but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.\n\n\"I've left Daisy's house,\" she said. \"I'm at Hempstead and I'm going down\nto Southampton this afternoon.\"\n\nProbably it had been tactful to leave Daisy's house, but the act\nannoyed me and her next remark made me rigid.\n\n\"You weren't so nice to me last night.\"\n\n\"How could it have mattered then?\"\n\nSilence for a moment. Then--\n\n\"However--I want to see you.\"\n\n\"I want to see you too.\"\n\n\"Suppose I don't go to Southampton, and come into town this afternoon?\"\n\n\"No--I don't think this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\"It's impossible this afternoon. Various----\"\n\nWe talked like that for a while and then abruptly we weren't talking any\nlonger. I don't know which of us hung up with a sharp click but I know I\ndidn't care. I couldn't have talked to her across a tea-table that day if\nI never talked to her again in this world.\n\nI called Gatsby's house a few minutes later, but the line was busy. I\ntried four times; finally an exasperated central told me the wire was\nbeing kept open for long distance from Detroit. Taking out my\ntime-table I drew a small circle around the three-fifty train. Then I\nleaned back in my chair and tried to think. It was just noon.\n\n\nWhen I passed the ashheaps on the train that morning I had crossed\ndeliberately to the other side of the car. I suppose there'd be a\ncurious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark\nspots in the dust and some garrulous man telling over and over what\nhad happened until it became less and less real even to him and he\ncould tell it no longer and Myrtle Wilson's tragic achievement was\nforgotten. Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at the\ngarage after we left there the night before.\n\nThey had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine. She must\nhave broken her rule against drinking that night for when she\narrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the\nambulance had already gone to Flushing. When they convinced her of\nthis she immediately fainted as if that was the intolerable part of\nthe affair. Someone kind or curious took her in his car and drove\nher in the wake of her sister's body.\n\nUntil long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front\nof the garage while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the\ncouch inside. For a while the door of the office was open and\neveryone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it.\nFinally someone said it was a shame and closed the door. Michaelis and\nseveral other men were with him--first four or five men, later two or\nthree men. Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger to wait\nthere fifteen minutes longer while he went back to his own place and made\na pot of coffee. After that he stayed there alone with Wilson until dawn.\n\nAbout three o'clock the quality of Wilson's incoherent muttering\nchanged--he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car. He\nannounced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged\nto, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had\ncome from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen.\n\nBut when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry \"Oh,\nmy God!\" again in his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt\nto distract him.\n\n\"How long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sit\nstill a minute and answer my question. How long have you been married?\"\n\n\"Twelve years.\"\n\n\"Ever had any children? Come on, George, sit still--I asked you a\nquestion. Did you ever have any children?\"\n\nThe hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light and whenever\nMichaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him\nlike the car that hadn't stopped a few hours before. He didn't like to go\ninto the garage because the work bench was stained where the body had\nbeen lying so he moved uncomfortably around the office--he knew every\nobject in it before morning--and from time to time sat down beside Wilson\ntrying to keep him more quiet.\n\n\"Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if you\nhaven't been there for a long time? Maybe I could call up the church\nand get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?\"\n\n\"Don't belong to any.\"\n\n\"You ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must have\ngone to church once. Didn't you get married in a church? Listen, George,\nlisten to me. Didn't you get married in a church?\"\n\n\"That was a long time ago.\"\n\nThe effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking--for a moment he\nwas silent. Then the same half knowing, half bewildered look came back\ninto his faded eyes.\n\n\"Look in the drawer there,\" he said, pointing at the desk.\n\n\"Which drawer?\"\n\n\"That drawer--that one.\"\n\nMichaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it but\na small expensive dog leash made of leather and braided silver. It was\napparently new.\n\n\"This?\" he inquired, holding it up.\n\nWilson stared and nodded.\n\n\"I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it but I\nknew it was something funny.\"\n\n\"You mean your wife bought it?\"\n\n\"She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.\"\n\nMichaelis didn't see anything odd in that and he gave Wilson a dozen\nreasons why his wife might have bought the dog leash. But conceivably\nWilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle,\nbecause he began saying \"Oh, my God!\" again in a whisper--his comforter\nleft several explanations in the air.\n\n\"Then he killed her,\" said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly.\n\n\"Who did?\"\n\n\"I have a way of finding out.\"\n\n\"You're morbid, George,\" said his friend. \"This has been a strain to you\nand you don't know what you're saying. You'd better try and sit quiet\ntill morning.\"\n\n\"He murdered her.\"\n\n\"It was an accident, George.\"\n\nWilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly\nwith the ghost of a superior \"Hm!\"\n\n\"I know,\" he said definitely, \"I'm one of these trusting fellas and I\ndon't think any harm to NObody, but when I get to know a thing I know\nit. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he\nwouldn't stop.\"\n\nMichaelis had seen this too but it hadn't occurred to him that there was\nany special significance in it. He believed that Mrs. Wilson had been\nrunning away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any\nparticular car.\n\n\"How could she of been like that?\"\n\n\"She's a deep one,\" said Wilson, as if that answered the question.\n\"Ah-h-h----\"\n\nHe began to rock again and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in\nhis hand.\n\n\"Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?\"\n\nThis was a forlorn hope--he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend:\nthere was not enough of him for his wife. He was glad a little later when\nhe noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and\nrealized that dawn wasn't far off. About five o'clock it was blue enough\noutside to snap off the light.\n\nWilson's glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps, where small grey\nclouds took on fantastic shape and scurried here and there in the faint\ndawn wind.\n\n\"I spoke to her,\" he muttered, after a long silence. \"I told her she might\nfool me but she couldn't fool God. I took her to the window--\" With an\neffort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face\npressed against it, \"--and I said 'God knows what you've been doing,\neverything you've been doing. You may fool me but you can't fool God!' \"\n\nStanding behind him Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the\neyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg which had just emerged pale and enormous\nfrom the dissolving night.\n\n\"God sees everything,\" repeated Wilson.\n\n\"That's an advertisement,\" Michaelis assured him. Something made him turn\naway from the window and look back into the room. But Wilson stood there a\nlong time, his face close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight.\n\n\nBy six o'clock Michaelis was worn out and grateful for the sound of a\ncar stopping outside. It was one of the watchers of the night before\nwho had promised to come back so he cooked breakfast for three which\nhe and the other man ate together. Wilson was quieter now and Michaelis\nwent home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the\ngarage Wilson was gone.\n\nHis movements--he was on foot all the time--were afterward traced to Port\nRoosevelt and then to Gad's Hill where he bought a sandwich that he\ndidn't eat and a cup of coffee. He must have been tired and walking\nslowly for he didn't reach Gad's Hill until noon. Thus far there was\nno difficulty in accounting for his time--there were boys who had seen a\nman \"acting sort of crazy\" and motorists at whom he stared oddly from\nthe side of the road. Then for three hours he disappeared from view.\nThe police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he \"had\na way of finding out,\" supposed that he spent that time going from\ngarage to garage thereabouts inquiring for a yellow car. On the other\nhand no garage man who had seen him ever came forward--and perhaps he\nhad an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to know. By\nhalf past two he was in West Egg where he asked someone the way to\nGatsby's house. So by that time he knew Gatsby's name.\n\n\nAt two o'clock Gatsby put on his bathing suit and left word with the\nbutler that if any one phoned word was to be brought to him at the\npool. He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused\nhis guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him pump it up.\nThen he gave instructions that the open car wasn't to be taken out\nunder any circumstances--and this was strange because the front right\nfender needed repair.\n\nGatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once he\nstopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he\nneeded help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among\nthe yellowing trees.\n\nNo telephone message arrived but the butler went without his sleep and\nwaited for it until four o'clock--until long after there was any one to\ngive it to if it came. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn't\nbelieve it would come and perhaps he no longer cared. If that was true\nhe must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high\nprice for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up\nat an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he\nfound what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was\nupon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being\nreal, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted\nfortuitously about . . . like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward\nhim through the amorphous trees.\n\nThe chauffeur--he was one of Wolfsheim's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s--heard the\nshots--afterward he could only say that he hadn't thought anything much\nabout them. I drove from the station directly to Gatsby's house and my\nrushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed any\none. But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a word said, four\nof us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener and I, hurried down to the pool.\n\nThere was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the\nfresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other.\nWith little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden\nmattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that\nscarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental\ncourse with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves\nrevolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of compass, a thin red circle\nin the water.\n\nIt was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener\nsaw Wilson's body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was\ncomplete.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\n\n\nAfter two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the\nnext day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and\nnewspaper men in and out of Gatsby's front door. A rope stretched\nacross the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but\nlittle boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard and\nthere were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the pool.\nSomeone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the\nexpression \"mad man\" as he bent over Wilson's body that afternoon, and\nthe adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper\nreports next morning.\n\nMost of those reports were a nightmare--grotesque, circumstantial,\neager and untrue. When Michaelis's testimony at the inquest brought to\nlight Wilson's suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would\nshortly be served up in racy pasquinade--but Catherine, who might have\nsaid anything, didn't say a word. She showed a surprising amount of\ncharacter about it too--looked at the coroner with determined eyes under\nthat corrected brow of hers and swore that her sister had never seen\nGatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her\nsister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced herself of it\nand cried into her handkerchief as if the very suggestion was more\nthan she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a man \"deranged by\ngrief\" in order that the case might remain in its simplest form. And\nit rested there.\n\nBut all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself on\nGatsby's side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of\nthe catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and\nevery practical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and\nconfused; then, as he lay in his house and didn't move or breathe or\nspeak hour upon hour it grew upon me that I was responsible, because no\none else was interested--interested, I mean, with that intense personal\ninterest to which every one has some vague right at the end.\n\nI called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her\ninstinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away\nearly that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.\n\n\"Left no address?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Say when they'd be back?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Any idea where they are? How I could reach them?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Can't say.\"\n\nI wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where he\nlay and reassure him: \"I'll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don't worry.\nJust trust me and I'll get somebody for you----\"\n\nMeyer Wolfsheim's name wasn't in the phone book. The butler gave me his\noffice address on Broadway and I called Information, but by the time I\nhad the number it was long after five and no one answered the phone.\n\n\"Will you ring again?\"\n\n\"I've rung them three times.\"\n\n\"It's very important.\"\n\n\"Sorry. I'm afraid no one's there.\"\n\nI went back to the drawing room and thought for an instant that they were\nchance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it. But\nas they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with unmoved eyes,\nhis protest continued in my brain.\n\n\"Look here, old sport, you've got to get somebody for me. You've got\nto try hard. I can't go through this alone.\"\n\nSome one started to ask me questions but I broke away and going upstairs\nlooked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk--he'd never told me\ndefinitely that his parents were dead. But there was nothing--only the\npicture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence staring down from\nthe wall.\n\nNext morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfsheim\nwhich asked for information and urged him to come out on the next\ntrain. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure he'd\nstart when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there'd be a wire\nfrom Daisy before noon--but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfsheim arrived, no\none arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men.\nWhen the butler brought back Wolfsheim's answer I began to have a\nfeeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me\nagainst them all.\n\n\n_Dear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my\nlife to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a mad\nact as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down now as\nI am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in\nthis thing now. If there is anything I can do a little later let me\nknow in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when I hear about a\nthing like this and am completely knocked down and out.\n\n                                        Yours truly\n                                                      MEYER Wolfsheim_\n\nand then hasty addenda beneath:\n\n_Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all._\n\n\nWhen the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was\ncalling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came\nthrough as a man's voice, very thin and far away.\n\n\"This is Slagle speaking. . . .\"\n\n\"Yes?\" The name was unfamiliar.\n\n\"Hell of a note, isn't it? Get my wire?\"\n\n\"There haven't been any wires.\"\n\n\"Young Parke's in trouble,\" he said rapidly. \"They picked him up when he\nhanded the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New York\ngiving 'em the numbers just five minutes before. What d'you know about\nthat, hey? You never can tell in these hick towns----\"\n\n\"Hello!\" I interrupted breathlessly. \"Look here--this isn't Mr. Gatsby.\nMr. Gatsby's dead.\"\n\nThere was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an\nexclamation . . . then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.\n\n\nI think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz\narrived from a town in Minnesota. It said only that the sender was\nleaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.\n\nIt was Gatsby's father, a solemn old man very helpless and dismayed,\nbundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day. His\neyes leaked continuously with excitement and when I took the bag and\numbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse\ngrey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was on the\npoint of collapse so I took him into the music room and made him sit\ndown while I sent for something to eat. But he wouldn't eat and the\nglass of milk spilled from his trembling hand.\n\n\"I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,\" he said. \"It was all in the Chicago\nnewspaper. I started right away.\"\n\n\"I didn't know how to reach you.\"\n\nHis eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room.\n\n\"It was a mad man,\" he said. \"He must have been mad.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you like some coffee?\" I urged him.\n\n\"I don't want anything. I'm all right now, Mr.----\"\n\n\"Carraway.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?\"\n\nI took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him there.\nSome little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall;\nwhen I told them who had arrived they went reluctantly away.\n\nAfter a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth\najar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and\nunpunctual tears. He had reached an age where death no longer has the\nquality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the\nfirst time and saw the height and splendor of the hall and the great\nrooms opening out from it into other rooms his grief began to be mixed\nwith an awed pride. I helped him to a bedroom upstairs; while he took\noff his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been\ndeferred until he came.\n\n\"I didn't know what you'd want, Mr. Gatsby----\"\n\n\"Gatz is my name.\"\n\n\"--Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body west.\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position in\nthe East. Were you a friend of my boy's, Mr.--?\"\n\n\"We were close friends.\"\n\n\"He had a big future before him, you know. He was only a young man but\nhe had a lot of brain power here.\"\n\nHe touched his head impressively and I nodded.\n\n\"If he'd of lived he'd of been a great man. A man like James J. Hill.\nHe'd of helped build up the country.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" I said, uncomfortably.\n\nHe fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the bed,\nand lay down stiffly--was instantly asleep.\n\nThat night an obviously frightened person called up and demanded to know\nwho I was before he would give his name.\n\n\"This is Mr. Carraway,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh--\" He sounded relieved. \"This is Klipspringer.\"\n\nI was relieved too for that seemed to promise another friend\nat Gatsby's grave. I didn't want it to be in the papers and draw\na sightseeing crowd so I'd been calling up a few people myself.\nThey were hard to find.\n\n\"The funeral's tomorrow,\" I said. \"Three o'clock, here at the house.\nI wish you'd tell anybody who'd be interested.\"\n\n\"Oh, I will,\" he broke out hastily. \"Of course I'm not likely to see\nanybody, but if I do.\"\n\nHis tone made me suspicious.\n\n\"Of course you'll be there yourself.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll certainly try. What I called up about is----\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" I interrupted. \"How about saying you'll come?\"\n\n\"Well, the fact is--the truth of the matter is that I'm staying with\nsome people up here in Greenwich and they rather expect me to be with\nthem tomorrow. In fact there's a sort of picnic or something.\nOf course I'll do my very best to get away.\"\n\nI ejaculated an unrestrained \"Huh!\" and he must have heard me for he went\non nervously:\n\n\"What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. I wonder if\nit'd be too much trouble to have the butler send them on. You\nsee they're tennis shoes and I'm sort of helpless without them. My\naddress is care of B. F.----\"\n\nI didn't hear the rest of the name because I hung up the receiver.\n\nAfter that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby--one gentleman to whom I\ntelephoned implied that he had got what he deserved. However, that was\nmy fault, for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at\nGatsby on the courage of Gatsby's liquor and I should have known\nbetter than to call him.\n\nThe morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer\nWolfsheim; I couldn't seem to reach him any other way. The door that I\npushed open on the advice of an elevator boy was marked \"The Swastika\nHolding Company\" and at first there didn't seem to be any one inside.\nBut when I'd shouted \"Hello\" several times in vain an argument broke\nout behind a partition and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an\ninterior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes.\n\n\"Nobody's in,\" she said. \"Mr. Wolfsheim's gone to Chicago.\"\n\nThe first part of this was obviously untrue for someone had begun to\nwhistle \"The Rosary,\" tunelessly, inside.\n\n\"Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.\"\n\n\"I can't get him back from Chicago, can I?\"\n\nAt this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfsheim's called \"Stella!\"\nfrom the other side of the door.\n\n\"Leave your name on the desk,\" she said quickly. \"I'll give it to him\nwhen he gets back.\"\n\n\"But I know he's there.\"\n\nShe took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up\nand down her hips.\n\n\"You young men think you can force your way in here any time,\" she\nscolded. \"We're getting sickantired of it. When I say he's in Chicago,\nhe's in ChiCAgo.\"\n\nI mentioned Gatsby.\n\n\"Oh--h!\" She looked at me over again. \"Will you just--what was your name?\"\n\nShe vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfsheim stood solemnly in the doorway,\nholding out both hands. He drew me into his office, remarking in a\nreverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered me\na cigar.\n\n\"My memory goes back to when I first met him,\" he said. \"A young\nmajor just out of the army and covered over with medals he got\nin the war. He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform\nbecause he couldn't buy some regular clothes. First time I saw him was\nwhen he come into Winebrenner's poolroom at Forty-third Street and\nasked for a job. He hadn't eat anything for a couple of days. 'Come on\nhave some lunch with me,' I sid. He ate more than four dollars' worth of\nfood in half an hour.\"\n\n\"Did you start him in business?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Start him! I made him.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right\naway he was a fine appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told\nme he was an Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join up\nin the American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he\ndid some work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like\nthat in everything--\" He held up two bulbous fingers \"--always\ntogether.\"\n\nI wondered if this partnership had included the World's Series transaction\nin 1919.\n\n\"Now he's dead,\" I said after a moment. \"You were his closest friend,\nso I know you'll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.\"\n\n\"I'd like to come.\"\n\n\"Well, come then.\"\n\nThe hair in his nostrils quivered slightly and as he shook his head his\neyes filled with tears.\n\n\"I can't do it--I can't get mixed up in it,\" he said.\n\n\"There's nothing to get mixed up in. It's all over now.\"\n\n\"When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way.\nI keep out. When I was a young man it was different--if a friend of mine\ndied, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You may think that's\nsentimental but I mean it--to the bitter end.\"\n\nI saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come,\nso I stood up.\n\n\"Are you a college man?\" he inquired suddenly.\n\nFor a moment I thought he was going to suggest a \"gonnegtion\" but he\nonly nodded and shook my hand.\n\n\"Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not\nafter he is dead,\" he suggested. \"After that my own rule is to let\neverything alone.\"\n\nWhen I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West Egg\nin a drizzle. After changing my clothes I went next door and found\nMr. Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall. His pride in his\nson and in his son's possessions was continually increasing and now he\nhad something to show me.\n\n\"Jimmy sent me this picture.\" He took out his wallet with trembling\nfingers. \"Look there.\"\n\nIt was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirty with\nmany hands. He pointed out every detail to me eagerly. \"Look there!\" and\nthen sought admiration from my eyes. He had shown it so often that I think\nit was more real to him now than the house itself.\n\n\"Jimmy sent it to me. I think it's a very pretty picture. It shows up\nwell.\"\n\n\"Very well. Had you seen him lately?\"\n\n\"He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in\nnow. Of course we was broke up when he run off from home but I see now\nthere was a reason for it. He knew he had a big future in front of him.\nAnd ever since he made a success he was very generous with me.\"\n\nHe seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another minute,\nlingeringly, before my eyes. Then he returned the wallet and pulled from\nhis pocket a ragged old copy of a book called \"Hopalong Cassidy.\"\n\n\"Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows\nyou.\"\n\nHe opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see.\nOn the last fly-leaf was printed the word SCHEDULE, and the date\nSeptember 12th, 1906. And underneath:\n\n\nRise from bed . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  6.00       A.M.\nDumbbell exercise and wall-scaling . . . . . . 6.15-6.30   \"\nStudy electricity, etc . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.15-8.15   \"\nWork . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8.30-4.30  P.M.\nBaseball and sports . . . . . . . . . . . . .  4.30-5.00   \"\nPractice elocution, poise and how to attain it 5.00-6.00   \"\nStudy needed inventions . . . . . . . . . . .  7.00-9.00   \"\n\n                GENERAL RESOLVES\n\nNo wasting time at Shafters or [a name, indecipherable]\nNo more smokeing or chewing\nBath every other day\nRead one improving book or magazine per week\nSave $5.00 [crossed out] $3.00 per week\nBe better to parents\n\n\n\"I come across this book by accident,\" said the old man. \"It just shows\nyou, don't it?\"\n\n\"It just shows you.\"\n\n\"Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this or\nsomething. Do you notice what he's got about improving his mind? He was\nalways great for that. He told me I et like a hog once and I beat him\nfor it.\"\n\nHe was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then\nlooking eagerly at me. I think he rather expected me to copy down the\nlist for my own use.\n\nA little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing and\nI began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars. So did\nGatsby's father. And as the time passed and the servants came in and\nstood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously and he\nspoke of the rain in a worried uncertain way. The minister glanced\nseveral times at his watch so I took him aside and asked him to wait\nfor half an hour. But it wasn't any use. Nobody came.\n\n\nAbout five o'clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery\nand stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate--first a motor hearse,\nhorribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and I in the\nlimousine, and, a little later, four or five servants and the postman\nfrom West Egg in Gatsby's station wagon, all wet to the skin. As we\nstarted through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then\nthe sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. I looked\naround. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found\nmarvelling over Gatsby's books in the library one night three months\nbefore.\n\nI'd never seen him since then. I don't know how he knew about the\nfuneral or even his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses and\nhe took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled\nfrom Gatsby's grave.\n\nI tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment but he was already too\nfar away and I could only remember, without resentment, that Daisy\nhadn't sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur\n\"Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,\" and then the owl-eyed\nman said \"Amen to that,\" in a brave voice.\n\nWe straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-Eyes spoke\nto me by the gate.\n\n\"I couldn't get to the house,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Neither could anybody else.\"\n\n\"Go on!\" He started. \"Why, my God! they used to go there by the\nhundreds.\"\n\nHe took off his glasses and wiped them again outside and in.\n\n\"The poor son-of-a-bitch,\" he said.\n\n\nOne of my most vivid memories is of coming back west from prep school\nand later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than\nChicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o'clock of a\nDecember evening with a few Chicago friends already caught up into\ntheir own holiday gayeties to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember\nthe fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This or That's and\nthe chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as\nwe caught sight of old acquaintances and the matchings of invitations:\n\"Are you going to the Ordways'? the Herseys'? the Schultzes'?\"\nand the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands.\nAnd last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul\nRailroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside\nthe gate.\n\nWhen we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow,\nbegan to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the\ndim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace\ncame suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked\nback from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our\nidentity with this country for one strange hour before we melted\nindistinguishably into it again.\n\nThat's my middle west--not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede\ntowns but the thrilling, returning trains of my youth and the street\nlamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly\nwreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a\nlittle solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent\nfrom growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are\nstill called through decades by a family's name. I see now that this\nhas been a story of the West, after all--Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and\nJordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some\ndeficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.\n\nEven when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware\nof its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the\nOhio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the\nchildren and the very old--even then it had always for me a quality of\ndistortion. West Egg especially still figures in my more fantastic\ndreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at\nonce conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging\nsky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress\nsuits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a\ndrunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over\nthe side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a\nhouse--the wrong house. But no one knows the woman's name, and no one\ncares.\n\nAfter Gatsby's death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted\nbeyond my eyes' power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle\nleaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the\nline I decided to come back home.\n\nThere was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant\nthing that perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted to\nleave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent\nsea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and\naround what had happened to us together and what had happened\nafterward to me, and she lay perfectly still listening in a big\nchair.\n\nShe was dressed to play golf and I remember thinking she looked like a\ngood illustration, her chin raised a little, jauntily, her hair the\ncolor of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless\nglove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without comment that\nshe was engaged to another man. I doubted that though there were\nseveral she could have married at a nod of her head but I pretended to\nbe surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn't making a\nmistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say\ngoodbye.\n\n\"Nevertheless you did throw me over,\" said Jordan suddenly. \"You threw me\nover on the telephone. I don't give a damn about you now but it was a\nnew experience for me and I felt a little dizzy for a while.\"\n\nWe shook hands.\n\n\"Oh, and do you remember--\" she added, \"----a conversation we had once\nabout driving a car?\"\n\n\"Why--not exactly.\"\n\n\"You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver?\nWell, I met another bad driver, didn't I? I mean it was careless of me\nto make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest,\nstraightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.\"\n\n\"I'm thirty,\" I said. \"I'm five years too old to lie to myself and call\nit honor.\"\n\nShe didn't answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously\nsorry, I turned away.\n\n\nOne afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead\nof me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a\nlittle from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving\nsharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as I\nslowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into\nthe windows of a jewelry store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back\nholding out his hand.\n\n\"What's the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?\"\n\n\"Yes. You know what I think of you.\"\n\n\"You're crazy, Nick,\" he said quickly. \"Crazy as hell. I don't know\nwhat's the matter with you.\"\n\n\"Tom,\" I inquired, \"what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?\"\n\nHe stared at me without a word and I knew I had guessed right about\nthose missing hours. I started to turn away but he took a step after me\nand grabbed my arm.\n\n\"I told him the truth,\" he said. \"He came to the door while we were\ngetting ready to leave and when I sent down word that we weren't in he\ntried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if I\nhadn't told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his\npocket every minute he was in the house----\" He broke off defiantly.\n\"What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw\ndust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy's but he was a tough\none. He ran over Myrtle like you'd run over a dog and never even stopped\nhis car.\"\n\nThere was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact\nthat it wasn't true.\n\n\"And if you think I didn't have my share of suffering--look here, when I\nwent to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting\nthere on the sideboard I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it\nwas awful----\"\n\nI couldn't forgive him or like him but I saw that what he had done was,\nto him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused.\nThey were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and\ncreatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast\ncarelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other\npeople clean up the mess they had made. . . .\n\nI shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as\nthough I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewelry store to\nbuy a pearl necklace--or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons--rid of my\nprovincial squeamishness forever.\n\n\nGatsby's house was still empty when I left--the grass on his lawn had\ngrown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village never\ntook a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and\npointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to\nEast Egg the night of the accident and perhaps he had made a story\nabout it all his own. I didn't want to hear it and I avoided him when I\ngot off the train.\n\nI spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling\nparties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the\nmusic and the laughter faint and incessant from his garden and the\ncars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a material car\nthere and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I didn't\ninvestigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the\nends of the earth and didn't know that the party was over.\n\nOn the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer,\nI went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once\nmore. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a\npiece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight and I erased it,\ndrawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the\nbeach and sprawled out on the sand.\n\nMost of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any\nlights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound.\nAnd as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away\nuntil gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered\nonce for Dutch sailors' eyes--a fresh, green breast of the new world.\nIts vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby's house, had\nonce pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams;\nfor a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the\npresence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation\nhe neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in\nhistory with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.\n\nAnd as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of\nGatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of\nDaisy's dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must\nhave seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not\nknow that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity\nbeyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under\nthe night.\n\nGatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by\nyear recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow\nwe will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine\nmorning----\n\nSo we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into\nthe past.\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nProject Gutenberg Australia",
        "summary": "**Summary of \"The Great Gatsby\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald**\n\n\"The Great Gatsby\" revolves around the mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his obsession with the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. The story is narrated by Nick Carraway, who moves to West Egg, Long Island, where he becomes Gatsby's neighbor.\n\nGatsby throws extravagant parties in hopes of attracting Daisy, his former lover. As their relationship rekindles, tensions arise due to Tom Buchanan, Daisy's wealthy husband, and his suspicions of Gatsby\u2019s past and wealth. Tom represents old money, while Gatsby symbolizes new money and the American Dream gone awry.\n\nAmidst the novel, themes of love, wealth, class, and the pursuit of the American Dream are explored. Gatsby's lavish lifestyle is contrasted with the grim realities in the valley of ashes, portrayed by the character George Wilson, who suffers from the consequences of aspirations that lead to tragedy.\n\nThe story culminates in a series of tragic events following a hit-and-run accident involving Gatsby's car, which leads to the death of Myrtle Wilson, George Wilson's wife. Tom manipulates George into believing Gatsby was responsible, leading to Gatsby\u2019s demise as George seeks revenge.\n\nIn the end, Gatsby's dream collapses as he is left alone, abandoned by Daisy and ultimately killed by George. The novel concludes with Nick reflecting on Gatsby\u2019s idealism and the elusive nature of the American Dream, indicating that no matter how hard one strives, the past is inescapable and can never be reclaimed.\n\nThe themes of aspiration, love, and the moral decay of society resonate throughout the story, showcasing Fitzgerald's critique of the American Dream and its unattainable nature.",

The room is\nluxuriously and artistically furnished. The sound of a piano is heard\nin the adjoining room.\n\n[Lane is arranging afternoon tea on the table, and after the music has\nceased, Algernon enters.]\n\nALGERNON.\nDid you hear what I was playing, Lane?\n\nLANE.\nI didn\u2019t think it polite to listen, sir.\n\nALGERNON.\nI\u2019m sorry for that, for your sake. I don\u2019t play accurately\u2014any one can\nplay accurately\u2014but I play with wonderful expression. As far as the\npiano is concerned, sentiment is my forte. I keep science for Life.\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir.\n\nALGERNON.\nAnd, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the cucumber\nsandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir. [Hands them on a salver.]\n\nALGERNON.\n[Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the sofa.] Oh! . . . by the\nway, Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night, when Lord\nShoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of\nchampagne are entered as having been consumed.\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.\n\nALGERNON.\nWhy is it that at a bachelor\u2019s establishment the servants invariably\ndrink the champagne? I ask merely for information.\n\nLANE.\nI attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir. I have often\nobserved that in married households the champagne is rarely of a\nfirst-rate brand.\n\nALGERNON.\nGood heavens! Is marriage so demoralising as that?\n\nLANE.\nI believe it _is_ a very pleasant state, sir. I have had very little\nexperience of it myself up to the present. I have only been married\nonce. That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and\na young person.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Languidly_._] I don\u2019t know that I am much interested in your family\nlife, Lane.\n\nLANE.\nNo, sir; it is not a very interesting subject. I never think of it\nmyself.\n\nALGERNON.\nVery natural, I am sure. That will do, Lane, thank you.\n\nLANE.\nThank you, sir. [Lane goes out.]\n\nALGERNON.\nLane\u2019s views on marriage seem somewhat lax. Really, if the lower orders\ndon\u2019t set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them? They\nseem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility.\n\n[Enter Lane.]\n\nLANE.\nMr. Ernest Worthing.\n\n[Enter Jack.]\n\n[Lane goes out_._]\n\nALGERNON.\nHow are you, my dear Ernest? What brings you up to town?\n\nJACK.\nOh, pleasure, pleasure! What else should bring one anywhere? Eating as\nusual, I see, Algy!\n\nALGERNON.\n[Stiffly_._] I believe it is customary in good society to take some\nslight refreshment at five o\u2019clock. Where have you been since last\nThursday?\n\nJACK.\n[Sitting down on the sofa.] In the country.\n\nALGERNON.\nWhat on earth do you do there?\n\nJACK.\n[Pulling off his gloves_._] When one is in town one amuses oneself.\nWhen one is in the country one amuses other people. It is excessively\nboring.\n\nALGERNON.\nAnd who are the people you amuse?\n\nJACK.\n[Airily_._] Oh, neighbours, neighbours.\n\nALGERNON.\nGot nice neighbours in your part of Shropshire?\n\nJACK.\nPerfectly horrid! Never speak to one of them.\n\nALGERNON.\nHow immensely you must amuse them! [Goes over and takes sandwich.] By\nthe way, Shropshire is your county, is it not?\n\nJACK.\nEh? Shropshire? Yes, of course. Hallo! Why all these cups? Why cucumber\nsandwiches? Why such reckless extravagance in one so young? Who is\ncoming to tea?\n\nALGERNON.\nOh! merely Aunt Augusta and Gwendolen.\n\nJACK.\nHow perfectly delightful!\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, that is all very well; but I am afraid Aunt Augusta won\u2019t quite\napprove of your being here.\n\nJACK.\nMay I ask why?\n\nALGERNON.\nMy dear fellow, the way you flirt with Gwendolen is perfectly\ndisgraceful. It is almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with you.\n\nJACK.\nI am in love with Gwendolen. I have come up to town expressly to\npropose to her.\n\nALGERNON.\nI thought you had come up for pleasure? . . . I call that business.\n\nJACK.\nHow utterly unromantic you are!\n\nALGERNON.\nI really don\u2019t see anything romantic in proposing. It is very romantic\nto be in love. But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal.\nWhy, one may be accepted. One usually is, I believe. Then the\nexcitement is all over. The very essence of romance is uncertainty. If\never I get married, I\u2019ll certainly try to forget the fact.\n\nJACK.\nI have no doubt about that, dear Algy. The Divorce Court was specially\ninvented for people whose memories are so curiously constituted.\n\nALGERNON.\nOh! there is no use speculating on that subject. Divorces are made in\nHeaven\u2014[Jack puts out his hand to take a sandwich. Algernon at once\ninterferes.] Please don\u2019t touch the cucumber sandwiches. They are\nordered specially for Aunt Augusta. [Takes one and eats it.]\n\nJACK.\nWell, you have been eating them all the time.\n\nALGERNON.\nThat is quite a different matter. She is my aunt. [Takes plate from\nbelow.] Have some bread and butter. The bread and butter is for\nGwendolen. Gwendolen is devoted to bread and butter.\n\nJACK.\n[Advancing to table and helping himself.] And very good bread and\nbutter it is too.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you were going to eat it\nall. You behave as if you were married to her already. You are not\nmarried to her already, and I don\u2019t think you ever will be.\n\nJACK.\nWhy on earth do you say that?\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt with.\nGirls don\u2019t think it right.\n\nJACK.\nOh, that is nonsense!\n\nALGERNON.\nIt isn\u2019t. It is a great truth. It accounts for the extraordinary number\nof bachelors that one sees all over the place. In the second place, I\ndon\u2019t give my consent.\n\nJACK.\nYour consent!\n\nALGERNON.\nMy dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin. And before I allow you to\nmarry her, you will have to clear up the whole question of Cecily.\n[Rings bell.]\n\nJACK.\nCecily! What on earth do you mean? What do you mean, Algy, by Cecily! I\ndon\u2019t know any one of the name of Cecily.\n\n[Enter Lane.]\n\nALGERNON.\nBring me that cigarette case Mr. Worthing left in the smoking-room the\nlast time he dined here.\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir. [Lane goes out.]\n\nJACK.\nDo you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time? I wish\nto goodness you had let me know. I have been writing frantic letters to\nScotland Yard about it. I was very nearly offering a large reward.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, I wish you would offer one. I happen to be more than usually hard\nup.\n\nJACK.\nThere is no good offering a large reward now that the thing is found.\n\n[Enter Lane with the cigarette case on a salver. Algernon takes it at\nonce. Lane goes out.]\n\nALGERNON.\nI think that is rather mean of you, Ernest, I must say. [Opens case and\nexamines it.] However, it makes no matter, for, now that I look at the\ninscription inside, I find that the thing isn\u2019t yours after all.\n\nJACK.\nOf course it\u2019s mine. [Moving to him.] You have seen me with it a\nhundred times, and you have no right whatsoever to read what is written\ninside. It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette\ncase.\n\nALGERNON.\nOh! it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what one should\nread and what one shouldn\u2019t. More than half of modern culture depends\non what one shouldn\u2019t read.\n\nJACK.\nI am quite aware of the fact, and I don\u2019t propose to discuss modern\nculture. It isn\u2019t the sort of thing one should talk of in private. I\nsimply want my cigarette case back.\n\nALGERNON.\nYes; but this isn\u2019t your cigarette case. This cigarette case is a\npresent from some one of the name of Cecily, and you said you didn\u2019t\nknow any one of that name.\n\nJACK.\nWell, if you want to know, Cecily happens to be my aunt.\n\nALGERNON.\nYour aunt!\n\nJACK.\nYes. Charming old lady she is, too. Lives at Tunbridge Wells. Just give\nit back to me, Algy.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Retreating to back of sofa.] But why does she call herself little\nCecily if she is your aunt and lives at Tunbridge Wells? [Reading.]\n\u2018From little Cecily with her fondest love.\u2019\n\nJACK.\n[Moving to sofa and kneeling upon it.] My dear fellow, what on earth is\nthere in that? Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall. That is a\nmatter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for herself. You\nseem to think that every aunt should be exactly like your aunt! That is\nabsurd! For Heaven\u2019s sake give me back my cigarette case. [Follows\nAlgernon round the room.]\n\nALGERNON.\nYes. But why does your aunt call you her uncle? \u2018From little Cecily,\nwith her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.\u2019 There is no objection, I\nadmit, to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an aunt, no matter what\nher size may be, should call her own nephew her uncle, I can\u2019t quite\nmake out. Besides, your name isn\u2019t Jack at all; it is Ernest.\n\nJACK.\nIt isn\u2019t Ernest; it\u2019s Jack.\n\nALGERNON.\nYou have always told me it was Ernest. I have introduced you to every\none as Ernest. You answer to the name of Ernest. You look as if your\nname was Ernest. You are the most earnest-looking person I ever saw in\nmy life. It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn\u2019t\nErnest. It\u2019s on your cards. Here is one of them. [Taking it from case.]\n\u2018Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany.\u2019 I\u2019ll keep this as a proof that\nyour name is Ernest if ever you attempt to deny it to me, or to\nGwendolen, or to any one else. [Puts the card in his pocket.]\n\nJACK.\nWell, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and the\ncigarette case was given to me in the country.\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, but that does not account for the fact that your small Aunt\nCecily, who lives at Tunbridge Wells, calls you her dear uncle. Come,\nold boy, you had much better have the thing out at once.\n\nJACK.\nMy dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were a dentist. It is very\nvulgar to talk like a dentist when one isn\u2019t a dentist. It produces a\nfalse impression.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, that is exactly what dentists always do. Now, go on! Tell me the\nwhole thing. I may mention that I have always suspected you of being a\nconfirmed and secret Bunburyist; and I am quite sure of it now.\n\nJACK.\nBunburyist? What on earth do you mean by a Bunburyist?\n\nALGERNON.\nI\u2019ll reveal to you the meaning of that incomparable expression as soon\nas you are kind enough to inform me why you are Ernest in town and Jack\nin the country.\n\nJACK.\nWell, produce my cigarette case first.\n\nALGERNON.\nHere it is. [Hands cigarette case.] Now produce your explanation, and\npray make it improbable. [Sits on sofa.]\n\nJACK.\nMy dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about my explanation at\nall. In fact it\u2019s perfectly ordinary. Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who\nadopted me when I was a little boy, made me in his will guardian to his\ngrand-daughter, Miss Cecily Cardew. Cecily, who addresses me as her\nuncle from motives of respect that you could not possibly appreciate,\nlives at my place in the country under the charge of her admirable\ngoverness, Miss Prism.\n\nALGERNON.\nWhere is that place in the country, by the way?\n\nJACK.\nThat is nothing to you, dear boy. You are not going to be invited . . .\nI may tell you candidly that the place is not in Shropshire.\n\nALGERNON.\nI suspected that, my dear fellow! I have Bunburyed all over Shropshire\non two separate occasions. Now, go on. Why are you Ernest in town and\nJack in the country?\n\nJACK.\nMy dear Algy, I don\u2019t know whether you will be able to understand my\nreal motives. You are hardly serious enough. When one is placed in the\nposition of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all\nsubjects. It\u2019s one\u2019s duty to do so. And as a high moral tone can hardly\nbe said to conduce very much to either one\u2019s health or one\u2019s happiness,\nin order to get up to town I have always pretended to have a younger\nbrother of the name of Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets into\nthe most dreadful scrapes. That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure\nand simple.\n\nALGERNON.\nThe truth is rarely pure and never simple. Modern life would be very\ntedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete\nimpossibility!\n\nJACK.\nThat wouldn\u2019t be at all a bad thing.\n\nALGERNON.\nLiterary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow. Don\u2019t try it. You\nshould leave that to people who haven\u2019t been at a University. They do\nit so well in the daily papers. What you really are is a Bunburyist. I\nwas quite right in saying you were a Bunburyist. You are one of the\nmost advanced Bunburyists I know.\n\nJACK.\nWhat on earth do you mean?\n\nALGERNON.\nYou have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest, in order\nthat you may be able to come up to town as often as you like. I have\ninvented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury, in order that\nI may be able to go down into the country whenever I choose. Bunbury is\nperfectly invaluable. If it wasn\u2019t for Bunbury\u2019s extraordinary bad\nhealth, for instance, I wouldn\u2019t be able to dine with you at Willis\u2019s\nto-night, for I have been really engaged to Aunt Augusta for more than\na week.\n\nJACK.\nI haven\u2019t asked you to dine with me anywhere to-night.\n\nALGERNON.\nI know. You are absurdly careless about sending out invitations. It is\nvery foolish of you. Nothing annoys people so much as not receiving\ninvitations.\n\nJACK.\nYou had much better dine with your Aunt Augusta.\n\nALGERNON.\nI haven\u2019t the smallest intention of doing anything of the kind. To\nbegin with, I dined there on Monday, and once a week is quite enough to\ndine with one\u2019s own relations. In the second place, whenever I do dine\nthere I am always treated as a member of the family, and sent down with\neither no woman at all, or two. In the third place, I know perfectly\nwell whom she will place me next to, to-night. She will place me next\nMary Farquhar, who always flirts with her own husband across the\ndinner-table. That is not very pleasant. Indeed, it is not even decent\n. . . and that sort of thing is enormously on the increase. The amount\nof women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly\nscandalous. It looks so bad. It is simply washing one\u2019s clean linen in\npublic. Besides, now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist I\nnaturally want to talk to you about Bunburying. I want to tell you the\nrules.\n\nJACK.\nI\u2019m not a Bunburyist at all. If Gwendolen accepts me, I am going to\nkill my brother, indeed I think I\u2019ll kill him in any case. Cecily is a\nlittle too much interested in him. It is rather a bore. So I am going\nto get rid of Ernest. And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr.\n. . . with your invalid friend who has the absurd name.\n\nALGERNON.\nNothing will induce me to part with Bunbury, and if you ever get\nmarried, which seems to me extremely problematic, you will be very glad\nto know Bunbury. A man who marries without knowing Bunbury has a very\ntedious time of it.\n\nJACK.\nThat is nonsense. If I marry a charming girl like Gwendolen, and she is\nthe only girl I ever saw in my life that I would marry, I certainly\nwon\u2019t want to know Bunbury.\n\nALGERNON.\nThen your wife will. You don\u2019t seem to realise, that in married life\nthree is company and two is none.\n\nJACK.\n[Sententiously.] That, my dear young friend, is the theory that the\ncorrupt French Drama has been propounding for the last fifty years.\n\nALGERNON.\nYes; and that the happy English home has proved in half the time.\n\nJACK.\nFor heaven\u2019s sake, don\u2019t try to be cynical. It\u2019s perfectly easy to be\ncynical.\n\nALGERNON.\nMy dear fellow, it isn\u2019t easy to be anything nowadays. There\u2019s such a\nlot of beastly competition about. [The sound of an electric bell is\nheard.] Ah! that must be Aunt Augusta. Only relatives, or creditors,\never ring in that Wagnerian manner. Now, if I get her out of the way\nfor ten minutes, so that you can have an opportunity for proposing to\nGwendolen, may I dine with you to-night at Willis\u2019s?\n\nJACK.\nI suppose so, if you want to.\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, but you must be serious about it. I hate people who are not\nserious about meals. It is so shallow of them.\n\n[Enter Lane.]\n\nLANE.\nLady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax.\n\n[Algernon goes forward to meet them. Enter Lady Bracknell and\nGwendolen.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nGood afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are behaving very well.\n\nALGERNON.\nI\u2019m feeling very well, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThat\u2019s not quite the same thing. In fact the two things rarely go\ntogether. [Sees Jack and bows to him with icy coldness.]\n\nALGERNON.\n[To Gwendolen.] Dear me, you are smart!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI am always smart! Am I not, Mr. Worthing?\n\nJACK.\nYou\u2019re quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nOh! I hope I am not that. It would leave no room for developments, and\nI intend to develop in many directions. [Gwendolen and Jack sit down\ntogether in the corner.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nI\u2019m sorry if we are a little late, Algernon, but I was obliged to call\non dear Lady Harbury. I hadn\u2019t been there since her poor husband\u2019s\ndeath. I never saw a woman so altered; she looks quite twenty years\nyounger. And now I\u2019ll have a cup of tea, and one of those nice cucumber\nsandwiches you promised me.\n\nALGERNON.\nCertainly, Aunt Augusta. [Goes over to tea-table.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nWon\u2019t you come and sit here, Gwendolen?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThanks, mamma, I\u2019m quite comfortable where I am.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Picking up empty plate in horror.] Good heavens! Lane! Why are there\nno cucumber sandwiches? I ordered them specially.\n\nLANE.\n[Gravely.] There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir. I\nwent down twice.\n\nALGERNON.\nNo cucumbers!\n\nLANE.\nNo, sir. Not even for ready money.\n\nALGERNON.\nThat will do, Lane, thank you.\n\nLANE.\nThank you, sir. [Goes out.]\n\nALGERNON.\nI am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta, about there being no cucumbers,\nnot even for ready money.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nIt really makes no matter, Algernon. I had some crumpets with Lady\nHarbury, who seems to me to be living entirely for pleasure now.\n\nALGERNON.\nI hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nIt certainly has changed its colour. From what cause I, of course,\ncannot say. [Algernon crosses and hands tea.] Thank you. I\u2019ve quite a\ntreat for you to-night, Algernon. I am going to send you down with Mary\nFarquhar. She is such a nice woman, and so attentive to her husband.\nIt\u2019s delightful to watch them.\n\nALGERNON.\nI am afraid, Aunt Augusta, I shall have to give up the pleasure of\ndining with you to-night after all.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Frowning.] I hope not, Algernon. It would put my table completely out.\nYour uncle would have to dine upstairs. Fortunately he is accustomed to\nthat.\n\nALGERNON.\nIt is a great bore, and, I need hardly say, a terrible disappointment\nto me, but the fact is I have just had a telegram to say that my poor\nfriend Bunbury is very ill again. [Exchanges glances with Jack.] They\nseem to think I should be with him.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nIt is very strange. This Mr. Bunbury seems to suffer from curiously bad\nhealth.\n\nALGERNON.\nYes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nWell, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time that Mr.\nBunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die. This\nshilly-shallying with the question is absurd. Nor do I in any way\napprove of the modern sympathy with invalids. I consider it morbid.\nIllness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others.\nHealth is the primary duty of life. I am always telling that to your\npoor uncle, but he never seems to take much notice . . . as far as any\nimprovement in his ailment goes. I should be much obliged if you would\nask Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough not to have a relapse on\nSaturday, for I rely on you to arrange my music for me. It is my last\nreception, and one wants something that will encourage conversation,\nparticularly at the end of the season when every one has practically\nsaid whatever they had to say, which, in most cases, was probably not\nmuch.\n\nALGERNON.\nI\u2019ll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta, if he is still conscious, and I\nthink I can promise you he\u2019ll be all right by Saturday. Of course the\nmusic is a great difficulty. You see, if one plays good music, people\ndon\u2019t listen, and if one plays bad music people don\u2019t talk. But I\u2019ll\nrun over the programme I\u2019ve drawn out, if you will kindly come into the\nnext room for a moment.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThank you, Algernon. It is very thoughtful of you. [Rising, and\nfollowing Algernon.] I\u2019m sure the programme will be delightful, after a\nfew expurgations. French songs I cannot possibly allow. People always\nseem to think that they are improper, and either look shocked, which is\nvulgar, or laugh, which is worse. But German sounds a thoroughly\nrespectable language, and indeed, I believe is so. Gwendolen, you will\naccompany me.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nCertainly, mamma.\n\n[Lady Bracknell and Algernon go into the music-room, Gwendolen remains\nbehind.]\n\nJACK.\nCharming day it has been, Miss Fairfax.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nPray don\u2019t talk to me about the weather, Mr. Worthing. Whenever people\ntalk to me about the weather, I always feel quite certain that they\nmean something else. And that makes me so nervous.\n\nJACK.\nI _do_ mean something else.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI thought so. In fact, I am never wrong.\n\nJACK.\nAnd I would like to be allowed to take advantage of Lady Bracknell\u2019s\ntemporary absence . . .\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI would certainly advise you to do so. Mamma has a way of coming back\nsuddenly into a room that I have often had to speak to her about.\n\nJACK.\n[Nervously.] Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admired you more\nthan any girl . . . I have ever met since . . . I met you.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYes, I am quite well aware of the fact. And I often wish that in\npublic, at any rate, you had been more demonstrative. For me you have\nalways had an irresistible fascination. Even before I met you I was far\nfrom indifferent to you. [Jack looks at her in amazement.] We live, as\nI hope you know, Mr. Worthing, in an age of ideals. The fact is\nconstantly mentioned in the more expensive monthly magazines, and has\nreached the provincial pulpits, I am told; and my ideal has always been\nto love some one of the name of Ernest. There is something in that name\nthat inspires absolute confidence. The moment Algernon first mentioned\nto me that he had a friend called Ernest, I knew I was destined to love\nyou.\n\nJACK.\nYou really love me, Gwendolen?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nPassionately!\n\nJACK.\nDarling! You don\u2019t know how happy you\u2019ve made me.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nMy own Ernest!\n\nJACK.\nBut you don\u2019t really mean to say that you couldn\u2019t love me if my name\nwasn\u2019t Ernest?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nBut your name is Ernest.\n\nJACK.\nYes, I know it is. But supposing it was something else? Do you mean to\nsay you couldn\u2019t love me then?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Glibly.] Ah! that is clearly a metaphysical speculation, and like most\nmetaphysical speculations has very little reference at all to the\nactual facts of real life, as we know them.\n\nJACK.\nPersonally, darling, to speak quite candidly, I don\u2019t much care about\nthe name of Ernest . . . I don\u2019t think the name suits me at all.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nIt suits you perfectly. It is a divine name. It has a music of its own.\nIt produces vibrations.\n\nJACK.\nWell, really, Gwendolen, I must say that I think there are lots of\nother much nicer names. I think Jack, for instance, a charming name.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nJack? . . . No, there is very little music in the name Jack, if any at\nall, indeed. It does not thrill. It produces absolutely no vibrations .\n. . I have known several Jacks, and they all, without exception, were\nmore than usually plain. Besides, Jack is a notorious domesticity for\nJohn! And I pity any woman who is married to a man called John. She\nwould probably never be allowed to know the entrancing pleasure of a\nsingle moment\u2019s solitude. The only really safe name is Ernest.\n\nJACK.\nGwendolen, I must get christened at once\u2014I mean we must get married at\nonce. There is no time to be lost.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nMarried, Mr. Worthing?\n\nJACK.\n[Astounded.] Well . . . surely. You know that I love you, and you led\nme to believe, Miss Fairfax, that you were not absolutely indifferent\nto me.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI adore you. But you haven\u2019t proposed to me yet. Nothing has been said\nat all about marriage. The subject has not even been touched on.\n\nJACK.\nWell . . . may I propose to you now?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI think it would be an admirable opportunity. And to spare you any\npossible disappointment, Mr. Worthing, I think it only fair to tell you\nquite frankly before-hand that I am fully determined to accept you.\n\nJACK.\nGwendolen!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYes, Mr. Worthing, what have you got to say to me?\n\nJACK.\nYou know what I have got to say to you.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYes, but you don\u2019t say it.\n\nJACK.\nGwendolen, will you marry me? [Goes on his knees.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nOf course I will, darling. How long you have been about it! I am afraid\nyou have had very little experience in how to propose.\n\nJACK.\nMy own one, I have never loved any one in the world but you.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYes, but men often propose for practice. I know my brother Gerald does.\nAll my girl-friends tell me so. What wonderfully blue eyes you have,\nErnest! They are quite, quite, blue. I hope you will always look at me\njust like that, especially when there are other people present. [Enter\nLady Bracknell.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nMr. Worthing! Rise, sir, from this semi-recumbent posture. It is most\nindecorous.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nMamma! [He tries to rise; she restrains him.] I must beg you to retire.\nThis is no place for you. Besides, Mr. Worthing has not quite finished\nyet.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nFinished what, may I ask?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI am engaged to Mr. Worthing, mamma. [They rise together.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nPardon me, you are not engaged to any one. When you do become engaged\nto some one, I, or your father, should his health permit him, will\ninform you of the fact. An engagement should come on a young girl as a\nsurprise, pleasant or unpleasant, as the case may be. It is hardly a\nmatter that she could be allowed to arrange for herself . . . And now I\nhave a few questions to put to you, Mr. Worthing. While I am making\nthese inquiries, you, Gwendolen, will wait for me below in the\ncarriage.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Reproachfully.] Mamma!\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nIn the carriage, Gwendolen! [Gwendolen goes to the door. She and Jack\nblow kisses to each other behind Lady Bracknell\u2019s back. Lady Bracknell\nlooks vaguely about as if she could not understand what the noise was.\nFinally turns round.] Gwendolen, the carriage!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYes, mamma. [Goes out, looking back at Jack.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Sitting down.] You can take a seat, Mr. Worthing.\n\n[Looks in her pocket for note-book and pencil.]\n\nJACK.\nThank you, Lady Bracknell, I prefer standing.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Pencil and note-book in hand.] I feel bound to tell you that you are\nnot down on my list of eligible young men, although I have the same\nlist as the dear Duchess of Bolton has. We work together, in fact.\nHowever, I am quite ready to enter your name, should your answers be\nwhat a really affectionate mother requires. Do you smoke?\n\nJACK.\nWell, yes, I must admit I smoke.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nI am glad to hear it. A man should always have an occupation of some\nkind. There are far too many idle men in London as it is. How old are\nyou?\n\nJACK.\nTwenty-nine.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nA very good age to be married at. I have always been of opinion that a\nman who desires to get married should know either everything or\nnothing. Which do you know?\n\nJACK.\n[After some hesitation.] I know nothing, Lady Bracknell.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nI am pleased to hear it. I do not approve of anything that tampers with\nnatural ignorance. Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it\nand the bloom is gone. The whole theory of modern education is\nradically unsound. Fortunately in England, at any rate, education\nproduces no effect whatsoever. If it did, it would prove a serious\ndanger to the upper classes, and probably lead to acts of violence in\nGrosvenor Square. What is your income?\n\nJACK.\nBetween seven and eight thousand a year.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Makes a note in her book.] In land, or in investments?\n\nJACK.\nIn investments, chiefly.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThat is satisfactory. What between the duties expected of one during\none\u2019s lifetime, and the duties exacted from one after one\u2019s death, land\nhas ceased to be either a profit or a pleasure. It gives one position,\nand prevents one from keeping it up. That\u2019s all that can be said about\nland.\n\nJACK.\nI have a country house with some land, of course, attached to it, about\nfifteen hundred acres, I believe; but I don\u2019t depend on that for my\nreal income. In fact, as far as I can make out, the poachers are the\nonly people who make anything out of it.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nA country house! How many bedrooms? Well, that point can be cleared up\nafterwards. You have a town house, I hope? A girl with a simple,\nunspoiled nature, like Gwendolen, could hardly be expected to reside in\nthe country.\n\nJACK.\nWell, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but it is let by the year to\nLady Bloxham. Of course, I can get it back whenever I like, at six\nmonths\u2019 notice.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nLady Bloxham? I don\u2019t know her.\n\nJACK.\nOh, she goes about very little. She is a lady considerably advanced in\nyears.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nAh, nowadays that is no guarantee of respectability of character. What\nnumber in Belgrave Square?\n\nJACK.\n149.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Shaking her head.] The unfashionable side. I thought there was\nsomething. However, that could easily be altered.\n\nJACK.\nDo you mean the fashion, or the side?\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Sternly.] Both, if necessary, I presume. What are your politics?\n\nJACK.\nWell, I am afraid I really have none. I am a Liberal Unionist.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nOh, they count as Tories. They dine with us. Or come in the evening, at\nany rate. Now to minor matters. Are your parents living?\n\nJACK.\nI have lost both my parents.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nTo lose one parent, Mr. Worthing, may be regarded as a misfortune; to\nlose both looks like carelessness. Who was your father? He was\nevidently a man of some wealth. Was he born in what the Radical papers\ncall the purple of commerce, or did he rise from the ranks of the\naristocracy?\n\nJACK.\nI am afraid I really don\u2019t know. The fact is, Lady Bracknell, I said I\nhad lost my parents. It would be nearer the truth to say that my\nparents seem to have lost me . . . I don\u2019t actually know who I am by\nbirth. I was . . . well, I was found.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nFound!\n\nJACK.\nThe late Mr. Thomas Cardew, an old gentleman of a very charitable and\nkindly disposition, found me, and gave me the name of Worthing, because\nhe happened to have a first-class ticket for Worthing in his pocket at\nthe time. Worthing is a place in Sussex. It is a seaside resort.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nWhere did the charitable gentleman who had a first-class ticket for\nthis seaside resort find you?\n\nJACK.\n[Gravely.] In a hand-bag.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nA hand-bag?\n\nJACK.\n[Very seriously.] Yes, Lady Bracknell. I was in a hand-bag\u2014a somewhat\nlarge, black leather hand-bag, with handles to it\u2014an ordinary hand-bag\nin fact.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nIn what locality did this Mr. James, or Thomas, Cardew come across this\nordinary hand-bag?\n\nJACK.\nIn the cloak-room at Victoria Station. It was given to him in mistake\nfor his own.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThe cloak-room at Victoria Station?\n\nJACK.\nYes. The Brighton line.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThe line is immaterial. Mr. Worthing, I confess I feel somewhat\nbewildered by what you have just told me. To be born, or at any rate\nbred, in a hand-bag, whether it had handles or not, seems to me to\ndisplay a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that\nreminds one of the worst excesses of the French Revolution. And I\npresume you know what that unfortunate movement led to? As for the\nparticular locality in which the hand-bag was found, a cloak-room at a\nrailway station might serve to conceal a social indiscretion\u2014has\nprobably, indeed, been used for that purpose before now\u2014but it could\nhardly be regarded as an assured basis for a recognised position in\ngood society.\n\nJACK.\nMay I ask you then what you would advise me to do? I need hardly say I\nwould do anything in the world to ensure Gwendolen\u2019s happiness.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nI would strongly advise you, Mr. Worthing, to try and acquire some\nrelations as soon as possible, and to make a definite effort to produce\nat any rate one parent, of either sex, before the season is quite over.\n\nJACK.\nWell, I don\u2019t see how I could possibly manage to do that. I can produce\nthe hand-bag at any moment. It is in my dressing-room at home. I really\nthink that should satisfy you, Lady Bracknell.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nMe, sir! What has it to do with me? You can hardly imagine that I and\nLord Bracknell would dream of allowing our only daughter\u2014a girl brought\nup with the utmost care\u2014to marry into a cloak-room, and form an\nalliance with a parcel? Good morning, Mr. Worthing!\n\n[Lady Bracknell sweeps out in majestic indignation.]\n\nJACK.\nGood morning! [Algernon, from the other room, strikes up the Wedding\nMarch. Jack looks perfectly furious, and goes to the door.] For\ngoodness\u2019 sake don\u2019t play that ghastly tune, Algy. How idiotic you are!\n\n[The music stops and Algernon enters cheerily.]\n\nALGERNON.\nDidn\u2019t it go off all right, old boy? You don\u2019t mean to say Gwendolen\nrefused you? I know it is a way she has. She is always refusing people.\nI think it is most ill-natured of her.\n\nJACK.\nOh, Gwendolen is as right as a trivet. As far as she is concerned, we\nare engaged. Her mother is perfectly unbearable. Never met such a\nGorgon . . . I don\u2019t really know what a Gorgon is like, but I am quite\nsure that Lady Bracknell is one. In any case, she is a monster, without\nbeing a myth, which is rather unfair . . . I beg your pardon, Algy, I\nsuppose I shouldn\u2019t talk about your own aunt in that way before you.\n\nALGERNON.\nMy dear boy, I love hearing my relations abused. It is the only thing\nthat makes me put up with them at all. Relations are simply a tedious\npack of people, who haven\u2019t got the remotest knowledge of how to live,\nnor the smallest instinct about when to die.\n\nJACK.\nOh, that is nonsense!\n\nALGERNON.\nIt isn\u2019t!\n\nJACK.\nWell, I won\u2019t argue about the matter. You always want to argue about\nthings.\n\nALGERNON.\nThat is exactly what things were originally made for.\n\nJACK.\nUpon my word, if I thought that, I\u2019d shoot myself . . . [A pause.] You\ndon\u2019t think there is any chance of Gwendolen becoming like her mother\nin about a hundred and fifty years, do you, Algy?\n\nALGERNON.\nAll women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man\ndoes. That\u2019s his.\n\nJACK.\nIs that clever?\n\nALGERNON.\nIt is perfectly phrased! and quite as true as any observation in\ncivilised life should be.\n\nJACK.\nI am sick to death of cleverness. Everybody is clever nowadays. You\ncan\u2019t go anywhere without meeting clever people. The thing has become\nan absolute public nuisance. I wish to goodness we had a few fools\nleft.\n\nALGERNON.\nWe have.\n\nJACK.\nI should extremely like to meet them. What do they talk about?\n\nALGERNON.\nThe fools? Oh! about the clever people, of course.\n\nJACK.\nWhat fools!\n\nALGERNON.\nBy the way, did you tell Gwendolen the truth about your being Ernest in\ntown, and Jack in the country?\n\nJACK.\n[In a very patronising manner.] My dear fellow, the truth isn\u2019t quite\nthe sort of thing one tells to a nice, sweet, refined girl. What\nextraordinary ideas you have about the way to behave to a woman!\n\nALGERNON.\nThe only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her, if she is\npretty, and to some one else, if she is plain.\n\nJACK.\nOh, that is nonsense.\n\nALGERNON.\nWhat about your brother? What about the profligate Ernest?\n\nJACK.\nOh, before the end of the week I shall have got rid of him. I\u2019ll say he\ndied in Paris of apoplexy. Lots of people die of apoplexy, quite\nsuddenly, don\u2019t they?\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, but it\u2019s hereditary, my dear fellow. It\u2019s a sort of thing that\nruns in families. You had much better say a severe chill.\n\nJACK.\nYou are sure a severe chill isn\u2019t hereditary, or anything of that kind?\n\nALGERNON.\nOf course it isn\u2019t!\n\nJACK.\nVery well, then. My poor brother Ernest is carried off suddenly, in\nParis, by a severe chill. That gets rid of him.\n\nALGERNON.\nBut I thought you said that . . . Miss Cardew was a little too much\ninterested in your poor brother Ernest? Won\u2019t she feel his loss a good\ndeal?\n\nJACK.\nOh, that is all right. Cecily is not a silly romantic girl, I am glad\nto say. She has got a capital appetite, goes long walks, and pays no\nattention at all to her lessons.\n\nALGERNON.\nI would rather like to see Cecily.\n\nJACK.\nI will take very good care you never do. She is excessively pretty, and\nshe is only just eighteen.\n\nALGERNON.\nHave you told Gwendolen yet that you have an excessively pretty ward\nwho is only just eighteen?\n\nJACK.\nOh! one doesn\u2019t blurt these things out to people. Cecily and Gwendolen\nare perfectly certain to be extremely great friends. I\u2019ll bet you\nanything you like that half an hour after they have met, they will be\ncalling each other sister.\n\nALGERNON.\nWomen only do that when they have called each other a lot of other\nthings first. Now, my dear boy, if we want to get a good table at\nWillis\u2019s, we really must go and dress. Do you know it is nearly seven?\n\nJACK.\n[Irritably.] Oh! It always is nearly seven.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, I\u2019m hungry.\n\nJACK.\nI never knew you when you weren\u2019t . . .\n\nALGERNON.\nWhat shall we do after dinner? Go to a theatre?\n\nJACK.\nOh no! I loathe listening.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, let us go to the Club?\n\nJACK.\nOh, no! I hate talking.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, we might trot round to the Empire at ten?\n\nJACK.\nOh, no! I can\u2019t bear looking at things. It is so silly.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, what shall we do?\n\nJACK.\nNothing!\n\nALGERNON.\nIt is awfully hard work doing nothing. However, I don\u2019t mind hard work\nwhere there is no definite object of any kind.\n\n[Enter Lane.]\n\nLANE.\nMiss Fairfax.\n\n[Enter Gwendolen. Lane goes out.]\n\nALGERNON.\nGwendolen, upon my word!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nAlgy, kindly turn your back. I have something very particular to say to\nMr. Worthing.\n\nALGERNON.\nReally, Gwendolen, I don\u2019t think I can allow this at all.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nAlgy, you always adopt a strictly immoral attitude towards life. You\nare not quite old enough to do that. [Algernon retires to the\nfireplace.]\n\nJACK.\nMy own darling!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nErnest, we may never be married. From the expression on mamma\u2019s face I\nfear we never shall. Few parents nowadays pay any regard to what their\nchildren say to them. The old-fashioned respect for the young is fast\ndying out. Whatever influence I ever had over mamma, I lost at the age\nof three. But although she may prevent us from becoming man and wife,\nand I may marry some one else, and marry often, nothing that she can\npossibly do can alter my eternal devotion to you.\n\nJACK.\nDear Gwendolen!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThe story of your romantic origin, as related to me by mamma, with\nunpleasing comments, has naturally stirred the deeper fibres of my\nnature. Your Christian name has an irresistible fascination. The\nsimplicity of your character makes you exquisitely incomprehensible to\nme. Your town address at the Albany I have. What is your address in the\ncountry?\n\nJACK.\nThe Manor House, Woolton, Hertfordshire.\n\n[Algernon, who has been carefully listening, smiles to himself, and\nwrites the address on his shirt-cuff. Then picks up the Railway Guide.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThere is a good postal service, I suppose? It may be necessary to do\nsomething desperate. That of course will require serious consideration.\nI will communicate with you daily.\n\nJACK.\nMy own one!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nHow long do you remain in town?\n\nJACK.\nTill Monday.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nGood! Algy, you may turn round now.\n\nALGERNON.\nThanks, I\u2019ve turned round already.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYou may also ring the bell.\n\nJACK.\nYou will let me see you to your carriage, my own darling?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nCertainly.\n\nJACK.\n[To Lane, who now enters.] I will see Miss Fairfax out.\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir. [Jack and Gwendolen go off.]\n\n[Lane presents several letters on a salver to Algernon. It is to be\nsurmised that they are bills, as Algernon, after looking at the\nenvelopes, tears them up.]\n\nALGERNON.\nA glass of sherry, Lane.\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir.\n\nALGERNON.\nTo-morrow, Lane, I\u2019m going Bunburying.\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir.\n\nALGERNON.\nI shall probably not be back till Monday. You can put up my dress\nclothes, my smoking jacket, and all the Bunbury suits . . .\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir. [Handing sherry.]\n\nALGERNON.\nI hope to-morrow will be a fine day, Lane.\n\nLANE.\nIt never is, sir.\n\nALGERNON.\nLane, you\u2019re a perfect pessimist.\n\nLANE.\nI do my best to give satisfaction, sir.\n\n[Enter Jack. Lane goes off.]\n\nJACK.\nThere\u2019s a sensible, intellectual girl! the only girl I ever cared for\nin my life. [Algernon is laughing immoderately.] What on earth are you\nso amused at?\n\nALGERNON.\nOh, I\u2019m a little anxious about poor Bunbury, that is all.\n\nJACK.\nIf you don\u2019t take care, your friend Bunbury will get you into a serious\nscrape some day.\n\nALGERNON.\nI love scrapes. They are the only things that are never serious.\n\nJACK.\nOh, that\u2019s nonsense, Algy. You never talk anything but nonsense.\n\nALGERNON.\nNobody ever does.\n\n[Jack looks indignantly at him, and leaves the room. Algernon lights a\ncigarette, reads his shirt-cuff, and smiles.]\n\nACT DROP\n\n\n\n\nSECOND ACT\n\n\nSCENE\n\nGarden at the Manor House. A flight of grey stone steps leads up to the\nhouse. The garden, an old-fashioned one, full of roses. Time of year,\nJuly. Basket chairs, and a table covered with books, are set under a\nlarge yew-tree.\n\n[Miss Prism discovered seated at the table. Cecily is at the back\nwatering flowers.]\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Calling.] Cecily, Cecily! Surely such a utilitarian occupation as the\nwatering of flowers is rather Moulton\u2019s duty than yours? Especially at\na moment when intellectual pleasures await you. Your German grammar is\non the table. Pray open it at page fifteen. We will repeat yesterday\u2019s\nlesson.\n\nCECILY.\n[Coming over very slowly.] But I don\u2019t like German. It isn\u2019t at all a\nbecoming language. I know perfectly well that I look quite plain after\nmy German lesson.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nChild, you know how anxious your guardian is that you should improve\nyourself in every way. He laid particular stress on your German, as he\nwas leaving for town yesterday. Indeed, he always lays stress on your\nGerman when he is leaving for town.\n\nCECILY.\nDear Uncle Jack is so very serious! Sometimes he is so serious that I\nthink he cannot be quite well.\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Drawing herself up.] Your guardian enjoys the best of health, and his\ngravity of demeanour is especially to be commended in one so\ncomparatively young as he is. I know no one who has a higher sense of\nduty and responsibility.\n\nCECILY.\nI suppose that is why he often looks a little bored when we three are\ntogether.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nCecily! I am surprised at you. Mr. Worthing has many troubles in his\nlife. Idle merriment and triviality would be out of place in his\nconversation. You must remember his constant anxiety about that\nunfortunate young man his brother.\n\nCECILY.\nI wish Uncle Jack would allow that unfortunate young man, his brother,\nto come down here sometimes. We might have a good influence over him,\nMiss Prism. I am sure you certainly would. You know German, and\ngeology, and things of that kind influence a man very much. [Cecily\nbegins to write in her diary.]\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Shaking her head.] I do not think that even I could produce any effect\non a character that according to his own brother\u2019s admission is\nirretrievably weak and vacillating. Indeed I am not sure that I would\ndesire to reclaim him. I am not in favour of this modern mania for\nturning bad people into good people at a moment\u2019s notice. As a man sows\nso let him reap. You must put away your diary, Cecily. I really don\u2019t\nsee why you should keep a diary at all.\n\nCECILY.\nI keep a diary in order to enter the wonderful secrets of my life. If I\ndidn\u2019t write them down, I should probably forget all about them.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nMemory, my dear Cecily, is the diary that we all carry about with us.\n\nCECILY.\nYes, but it usually chronicles the things that have never happened, and\ncouldn\u2019t possibly have happened. I believe that Memory is responsible\nfor nearly all the three-volume novels that Mudie sends us.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nDo not speak slightingly of the three-volume novel, Cecily. I wrote one\nmyself in earlier days.\n\nCECILY.\nDid you really, Miss Prism? How wonderfully clever you are! I hope it\ndid not end happily? I don\u2019t like novels that end happily. They depress\nme so much.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nThe good ended happily, and the bad unhappily. That is what Fiction\nmeans.\n\nCECILY.\nI suppose so. But it seems very unfair. And was your novel ever\npublished?\n\nMISS PRISM.\nAlas! no. The manuscript unfortunately was abandoned. [Cecily starts.]\nI use the word in the sense of lost or mislaid. To your work, child,\nthese speculations are profitless.\n\nCECILY.\n[Smiling.] But I see dear Dr. Chasuble coming up through the garden.\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Rising and advancing.] Dr. Chasuble! This is indeed a pleasure.\n\n[Enter Canon Chasuble.]\n\nCHASUBLE.\nAnd how are we this morning? Miss Prism, you are, I trust, well?\n\nCECILY.\nMiss Prism has just been complaining of a slight headache. I think it\nwould do her so much good to have a short stroll with you in the Park,\nDr. Chasuble.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nCecily, I have not mentioned anything about a headache.\n\nCECILY.\nNo, dear Miss Prism, I know that, but I felt instinctively that you had\na headache. Indeed I was thinking about that, and not about my German\nlesson, when the Rector came in.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nI hope, Cecily, you are not inattentive.\n\nCECILY.\nOh, I am afraid I am.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nThat is strange. Were I fortunate enough to be Miss Prism\u2019s pupil, I\nwould hang upon her lips. [Miss Prism glares.] I spoke\nmetaphorically.\u2014My metaphor was drawn from bees. Ahem! Mr. Worthing, I\nsuppose, has not returned from town yet?\n\nMISS PRISM.\nWe do not expect him till Monday afternoon.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nAh yes, he usually likes to spend his Sunday in London. He is not one\nof those whose sole aim is enjoyment, as, by all accounts, that\nunfortunate young man his brother seems to be. But I must not disturb\nEgeria and her pupil any longer.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nEgeria? My name is L\u00e6titia, Doctor.\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[Bowing.] A classical allusion merely, drawn from the Pagan authors. I\nshall see you both no doubt at Evensong?\n\nMISS PRISM.\nI think, dear Doctor, I will have a stroll with you. I find I have a\nheadache after all, and a walk might do it good.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nWith pleasure, Miss Prism, with pleasure. We might go as far as the\nschools and back.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nThat would be delightful. Cecily, you will read your Political Economy\nin my absence. The chapter on the Fall of the Rupee you may omit. It is\nsomewhat too sensational. Even these metallic problems have their\nmelodramatic side.\n\n[Goes down the garden with Dr. Chasuble.]\n\nCECILY.\n[Picks up books and throws them back on table.] Horrid Political\nEconomy! Horrid Geography! Horrid, horrid German!\n\n[Enter Merriman with a card on a salver.]\n\nMERRIMAN.\nMr. Ernest Worthing has just driven over from the station. He has\nbrought his luggage with him.\n\nCECILY.\n[Takes the card and reads it.] \u2018Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany,\nW.\u2019 Uncle Jack\u2019s brother! Did you tell him Mr. Worthing was in town?\n\nMERRIMAN.\nYes, Miss. He seemed very much disappointed. I mentioned that you and\nMiss Prism were in the garden. He said he was anxious to speak to you\nprivately for a moment.\n\nCECILY.\nAsk Mr. Ernest Worthing to come here. I suppose you had better talk to\nthe housekeeper about a room for him.\n\nMERRIMAN.\nYes, Miss.\n\n[Merriman goes off.]\n\nCECILY.\nI have never met any really wicked person before. I feel rather\nfrightened. I am so afraid he will look just like every one else.\n\n[Enter Algernon, very gay and debonnair.] He does!\n\nALGERNON.\n[Raising his hat.] You are my little cousin Cecily, I\u2019m sure.\n\nCECILY.\nYou are under some strange mistake. I am not little. In fact, I believe\nI am more than usually tall for my age. [Algernon is rather taken\naback.] But I am your cousin Cecily. You, I see from your card, are\nUncle Jack\u2019s brother, my cousin Ernest, my wicked cousin Ernest.\n\nALGERNON.\nOh! I am not really wicked at all, cousin Cecily. You mustn\u2019t think\nthat I am wicked.\n\nCECILY.\nIf you are not, then you have certainly been deceiving us all in a very\ninexcusable manner. I hope you have not been leading a double life,\npretending to be wicked and being really good all the time. That would\nbe hypocrisy.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Looks at her in amazement.] Oh! Of course I have been rather reckless.\n\nCECILY.\nI am glad to hear it.\n\nALGERNON.\nIn fact, now you mention the subject, I have been very bad in my own\nsmall way.\n\nCECILY.\nI don\u2019t think you should be so proud of that, though I am sure it must\nhave been very pleasant.\n\nALGERNON.\nIt is much pleasanter being here with you.\n\nCECILY.\nI can\u2019t understand how you are here at all. Uncle Jack won\u2019t be back\ntill Monday afternoon.\n\nALGERNON.\nThat is a great disappointment. I am obliged to go up by the first\ntrain on Monday morning. I have a business appointment that I am\nanxious . . . to miss?\n\nCECILY.\nCouldn\u2019t you miss it anywhere but in London?\n\nALGERNON.\nNo: the appointment is in London.\n\nCECILY.\nWell, I know, of course, how important it is not to keep a business\nengagement, if one wants to retain any sense of the beauty of life, but\nstill I think you had better wait till Uncle Jack arrives. I know he\nwants to speak to you about your emigrating.\n\nALGERNON.\nAbout my what?\n\nCECILY.\nYour emigrating. He has gone up to buy your outfit.\n\nALGERNON.\nI certainly wouldn\u2019t let Jack buy my outfit. He has no taste in\nneckties at all.\n\nCECILY.\nI don\u2019t think you will require neckties. Uncle Jack is sending you to\nAustralia.\n\nALGERNON.\nAustralia! I\u2019d sooner die.\n\nCECILY.\nWell, he said at dinner on Wednesday night, that you would have to\nchoose between this world, the next world, and Australia.\n\nALGERNON.\nOh, well! The accounts I have received of Australia and the next world,\nare not particularly encouraging. This world is good enough for me,\ncousin Cecily.\n\nCECILY.\nYes, but are you good enough for it?\n\nALGERNON.\nI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not that. That is why I want you to reform me. You might\nmake that your mission, if you don\u2019t mind, cousin Cecily.\n\nCECILY.\nI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve no time, this afternoon.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, would you mind my reforming myself this afternoon?\n\nCECILY.\nIt is rather Quixotic of you. But I think you should try.\n\nALGERNON.\nI will. I feel better already.\n\nCECILY.\nYou are looking a little worse.\n\nALGERNON.\nThat is because I am hungry.\n\nCECILY.\nHow thoughtless of me. I should have remembered that when one is going\nto lead an entirely new life, one requires regular and wholesome meals.\nWon\u2019t you come in?\n\nALGERNON.\nThank you. Might I have a buttonhole first? I never have any appetite\nunless I have a buttonhole first.\n\nCECILY.\nA Marechal Niel? [Picks up scissors.]\n\nALGERNON.\nNo, I\u2019d sooner have a pink rose.\n\nCECILY.\nWhy? [Cuts a flower.]\n\nALGERNON.\nBecause you are like a pink rose, Cousin Cecily.\n\nCECILY.\nI don\u2019t think it can be right for you to talk to me like that. Miss\nPrism never says such things to me.\n\nALGERNON.\nThen Miss Prism is a short-sighted old lady. [Cecily puts the rose in\nhis buttonhole.] You are the prettiest girl I ever saw.\n\nCECILY.\nMiss Prism says that all good looks are a snare.\n\nALGERNON.\nThey are a snare that every sensible man would like to be caught in.\n\nCECILY.\nOh, I don\u2019t think I would care to catch a sensible man. I shouldn\u2019t\nknow what to talk to him about.\n\n[They pass into the house. Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble return.]\n\nMISS PRISM.\nYou are too much alone, dear Dr. Chasuble. You should get married. A\nmisanthrope I can understand\u2014a womanthrope, never!\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[With a scholar\u2019s shudder.] Believe me, I do not deserve so neologistic\na phrase. The precept as well as the practice of the Primitive Church\nwas distinctly against matrimony.\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Sententiously.] That is obviously the reason why the Primitive Church\nhas not lasted up to the present day. And you do not seem to realise,\ndear Doctor, that by persistently remaining single, a man converts\nhimself into a permanent public temptation. Men should be more careful;\nthis very celibacy leads weaker vessels astray.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nBut is a man not equally attractive when married?\n\nMISS PRISM.\nNo married man is ever attractive except to his wife.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nAnd often, I\u2019ve been told, not even to her.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nThat depends on the intellectual sympathies of the woman. Maturity can\nalways be depended on. Ripeness can be trusted. Young women are green.\n[Dr. Chasuble starts.] I spoke horticulturally. My metaphor was drawn\nfrom fruits. But where is Cecily?\n\nCHASUBLE.\nPerhaps she followed us to the schools.\n\n[Enter Jack slowly from the back of the garden. He is dressed in the\ndeepest mourning, with crape hatband and black gloves.]\n\nMISS PRISM.\nMr. Worthing!\n\nCHASUBLE.\nMr. Worthing?\n\nMISS PRISM.\nThis is indeed a surprise. We did not look for you till Monday\nafternoon.\n\nJACK.\n[Shakes Miss Prism\u2019s hand in a tragic manner.] I have returned sooner\nthan I expected. Dr. Chasuble, I hope you are well?\n\nCHASUBLE.\nDear Mr. Worthing, I trust this garb of woe does not betoken some\nterrible calamity?\n\nJACK.\nMy brother.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nMore shameful debts and extravagance?\n\nCHASUBLE.\nStill leading his life of pleasure?\n\nJACK.\n[Shaking his head.] Dead!\n\nCHASUBLE.\nYour brother Ernest dead?\n\nJACK.\nQuite dead.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nWhat a lesson for him! I trust he will profit by it.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nMr. Worthing, I offer you my sincere condolence. You have at least the\nconsolation of knowing that you were always the most generous and\nforgiving of brothers.\n\nJACK.\nPoor Ernest! He had many faults, but it is a sad, sad blow.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nVery sad indeed. Were you with him at the end?\n\nJACK.\nNo. He died abroad; in Paris, in fact. I had a telegram last night from\nthe manager of the Grand Hotel.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nWas the cause of death mentioned?\n\nJACK.\nA severe chill, it seems.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nAs a man sows, so shall he reap.\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[Raising his hand.] Charity, dear Miss Prism, charity! None of us are\nperfect. I myself am peculiarly susceptible to draughts. Will the\ninterment take place here?\n\nJACK.\nNo. He seems to have expressed a desire to be buried in Paris.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nIn Paris! [Shakes his head.] I fear that hardly points to any very\nserious state of mind at the last. You would no doubt wish me to make\nsome slight allusion to this tragic domestic affliction next Sunday.\n[Jack presses his hand convulsively.] My sermon on the meaning of the\nmanna in the wilderness can be adapted to almost any occasion, joyful,\nor, as in the present case, distressing. [All sigh.] I have preached it\nat harvest celebrations, christenings, confirmations, on days of\nhumiliation and festal days. The last time I delivered it was in the\nCathedral, as a charity sermon on behalf of the Society for the\nPrevention of Discontent among the Upper Orders. The Bishop, who was\npresent, was much struck by some of the analogies I drew.\n\nJACK.\nAh! that reminds me, you mentioned christenings I think, Dr. Chasuble?\nI suppose you know how to christen all right? [Dr. Chasuble looks\nastounded.] I mean, of course, you are continually christening, aren\u2019t\nyou?\n\nMISS PRISM.\nIt is, I regret to say, one of the Rector\u2019s most constant duties in\nthis parish. I have often spoken to the poorer classes on the subject.\nBut they don\u2019t seem to know what thrift is.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nBut is there any particular infant in whom you are interested, Mr.\nWorthing? Your brother was, I believe, unmarried, was he not?\n\nJACK.\nOh yes.\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Bitterly.] People who live entirely for pleasure usually are.\n\nJACK.\nBut it is not for any child, dear Doctor. I am very fond of children.\nNo! the fact is, I would like to be christened myself, this afternoon,\nif you have nothing better to do.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nBut surely, Mr. Worthing, you have been christened already?\n\nJACK.\nI don\u2019t remember anything about it.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nBut have you any grave doubts on the subject?\n\nJACK.\nI certainly intend to have. Of course I don\u2019t know if the thing would\nbother you in any way, or if you think I am a little too old now.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nNot at all. The sprinkling, and, indeed, the immersion of adults is a\nperfectly canonical practice.\n\nJACK.\nImmersion!\n\nCHASUBLE.\nYou need have no apprehensions. Sprinkling is all that is necessary, or\nindeed I think advisable. Our weather is so changeable. At what hour\nwould you wish the ceremony performed?\n\nJACK.\nOh, I might trot round about five if that would suit you.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nPerfectly, perfectly! In fact I have two similar ceremonies to perform\nat that time. A case of twins that occurred recently in one of the\noutlying cottages on your own estate. Poor Jenkins the carter, a most\nhard-working man.\n\nJACK.\nOh! I don\u2019t see much fun in being christened along with other babies.\nIt would be childish. Would half-past five do?\n\nCHASUBLE.\nAdmirably! Admirably! [Takes out watch.] And now, dear Mr. Worthing, I\nwill not intrude any longer into a house of sorrow. I would merely beg\nyou not to be too much bowed down by grief. What seem to us bitter\ntrials are often blessings in disguise.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nThis seems to me a blessing of an extremely obvious kind.\n\n[Enter Cecily from the house.]\n\nCECILY.\nUncle Jack! Oh, I am pleased to see you back. But what horrid clothes\nyou have got on! Do go and change them.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nCecily!\n\nCHASUBLE.\nMy child! my child! [Cecily goes towards Jack; he kisses her brow in a\nmelancholy manner.]\n\nCECILY.\nWhat is the matter, Uncle Jack? Do look happy! You look as if you had\ntoothache, and I have got such a surprise for you. Who do you think is\nin the dining-room? Your brother!\n\nJACK.\nWho?\n\nCECILY.\nYour brother Ernest. He arrived about half an hour ago.\n\nJACK.\nWhat nonsense! I haven\u2019t got a brother.\n\nCECILY.\nOh, don\u2019t say that. However badly he may have behaved to you in the\npast he is still your brother. You couldn\u2019t be so heartless as to\ndisown him. I\u2019ll tell him to come out. And you will shake hands with\nhim, won\u2019t you, Uncle Jack? [Runs back into the house.]\n\nCHASUBLE.\nThese are very joyful tidings.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nAfter we had all been resigned to his loss, his sudden return seems to\nme peculiarly distressing.\n\nJACK.\nMy brother is in the dining-room? I don\u2019t know what it all means. I\nthink it is perfectly absurd.\n\n[Enter Algernon and Cecily hand in hand. They come slowly up to Jack.]\n\nJACK.\nGood heavens! [Motions Algernon away.]\n\nALGERNON.\nBrother John, I have come down from town to tell you that I am very\nsorry for all the trouble I have given you, and that I intend to lead a\nbetter life in the future. [Jack glares at him and does not take his\nhand.]\n\nCECILY.\nUncle Jack, you are not going to refuse your own brother\u2019s hand?\n\nJACK.\nNothing will induce me to take his hand. I think his coming down here\ndisgraceful. He knows perfectly well why.\n\nCECILY.\nUncle Jack, do be nice. There is some good in every one. Ernest has\njust been telling me about his poor invalid friend Mr. Bunbury whom he\ngoes to visit so often. And surely there must be much good in one who\nis kind to an invalid, and leaves the pleasures of London to sit by a\nbed of pain.\n\nJACK.\nOh! he has been talking about Bunbury, has he?\n\nCECILY.\nYes, he has told me all about poor Mr. Bunbury, and his terrible state\nof health.\n\nJACK.\nBunbury! Well, I won\u2019t have him talk to you about Bunbury or about\nanything else. It is enough to drive one perfectly frantic.\n\nALGERNON.\nOf course I admit that the faults were all on my side. But I must say\nthat I think that Brother John\u2019s coldness to me is peculiarly painful.\nI expected a more enthusiastic welcome, especially considering it is\nthe first time I have come here.\n\nCECILY.\nUncle Jack, if you don\u2019t shake hands with Ernest I will never forgive\nyou.\n\nJACK.\nNever forgive me?\n\nCECILY.\nNever, never, never!\n\nJACK.\nWell, this is the last time I shall ever do it. [Shakes with Algernon\nand glares.]\n\nCHASUBLE.\nIt\u2019s pleasant, is it not, to see so perfect a reconciliation? I think\nwe might leave the two brothers together.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nCecily, you will come with us.\n\nCECILY.\nCertainly, Miss Prism. My little task of reconciliation is over.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nYou have done a beautiful action to-day, dear child.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nWe must not be premature in our judgments.\n\nCECILY.\nI feel very happy. [They all go off except Jack and Algernon.]\n\nJACK.\nYou young scoundrel, Algy, you must get out of this place as soon as\npossible. I don\u2019t allow any Bunburying here.\n\n[Enter Merriman.]\n\nMERRIMAN.\nI have put Mr. Ernest\u2019s things in the room next to yours, sir. I\nsuppose that is all right?\n\nJACK.\nWhat?\n\nMERRIMAN.\nMr. Ernest\u2019s luggage, sir. I have unpacked it and put it in the room\nnext to your own.\n\nJACK.\nHis luggage?\n\nMERRIMAN.\nYes, sir. Three portmanteaus, a dressing-case, two hat-boxes, and a\nlarge luncheon-basket.\n\nALGERNON.\nI am afraid I can\u2019t stay more than a week this time.\n\nJACK.\nMerriman, order the dog-cart at once. Mr. Ernest has been suddenly\ncalled back to town.\n\nMERRIMAN.\nYes, sir. [Goes back into the house.]\n\nALGERNON.\nWhat a fearful liar you are, Jack. I have not been called back to town\nat all.\n\nJACK.\nYes, you have.\n\nALGERNON.\nI haven\u2019t heard any one call me.\n\nJACK.\nYour duty as a gentleman calls you back.\n\nALGERNON.\nMy duty as a gentleman has never interfered with my pleasures in the\nsmallest degree.\n\nJACK.\nI can quite understand that.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, Cecily is a darling.\n\nJACK.\nYou are not to talk of Miss Cardew like that. I don\u2019t like it.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, I don\u2019t like your clothes. You look perfectly ridiculous in them.\nWhy on earth don\u2019t you go up and change? It is perfectly childish to be\nin deep mourning for a man who is actually staying for a whole week\nwith you in your house as a guest. I call it grotesque.\n\nJACK.\nYou are certainly not staying with me for a whole week as a guest or\nanything else. You have got to leave . . . by the four-five train.\n\nALGERNON.\nI certainly won\u2019t leave you so long as you are in mourning. It would be\nmost unfriendly. If I were in mourning you would stay with me, I\nsuppose. I should think it very unkind if you didn\u2019t.\n\nJACK.\nWell, will you go if I change my clothes?\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, if you are not too long. I never saw anybody take so long to\ndress, and with such little result.\n\nJACK.\nWell, at any rate, that is better than being always over-dressed as you\nare.\n\nALGERNON.\nIf I am occasionally a little over-dressed, I make up for it by being\nalways immensely over-educated.\n\nJACK.\nYour vanity is ridiculous, your conduct an outrage, and your presence\nin my garden utterly absurd. However, you have got to catch the\nfour-five, and I hope you will have a pleasant journey back to town.\nThis Bunburying, as you call it, has not been a great success for you.\n\n[Goes into the house.]\n\nALGERNON.\nI think it has been a great success. I\u2019m in love with Cecily, and that\nis everything.\n\n[Enter Cecily at the back of the garden. She picks up the can and\nbegins to water the flowers.] But I must see her before I go, and make\narrangements for another Bunbury. Ah, there she is.\n\nCECILY.\nOh, I merely came back to water the roses. I thought you were with\nUncle Jack.\n\nALGERNON.\nHe\u2019s gone to order the dog-cart for me.\n\nCECILY.\nOh, is he going to take you for a nice drive?\n\nALGERNON.\nHe\u2019s going to send me away.\n\nCECILY.\nThen have we got to part?\n\nALGERNON.\nI am afraid so. It\u2019s a very painful parting.\n\nCECILY.\nIt is always painful to part from people whom one has known for a very\nbrief space of time. The absence of old friends one can endure with\nequanimity. But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has\njust been introduced is almost unbearable.\n\nALGERNON.\nThank you.\n\n[Enter Merriman.]\n\nMERRIMAN.\nThe dog-cart is at the door, sir. [Algernon looks appealingly at\nCecily.]\n\nCECILY.\nIt can wait, Merriman for . . . five minutes.\n\nMERRIMAN.\nYes, Miss. [Exit Merriman.]\n\nALGERNON.\nI hope, Cecily, I shall not offend you if I state quite frankly and\nopenly that you seem to me to be in every way the visible\npersonification of absolute perfection.\n\nCECILY.\nI think your frankness does you great credit, Ernest. If you will allow\nme, I will copy your remarks into my diary. [Goes over to table and\nbegins writing in diary.]\n\nALGERNON.\nDo you really keep a diary? I\u2019d give anything to look at it. May I?\n\nCECILY.\nOh no. [Puts her hand over it.] You see, it is simply a very young\ngirl\u2019s record of her own thoughts and impressions, and consequently\nmeant for publication. When it appears in volume form I hope you will\norder a copy. But pray, Ernest, don\u2019t stop. I delight in taking down\nfrom dictation. I have reached \u2018absolute perfection\u2019. You can go on. I\nam quite ready for more.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Somewhat taken aback.] Ahem! Ahem!\n\nCECILY.\nOh, don\u2019t cough, Ernest. When one is dictating one should speak\nfluently and not cough. Besides, I don\u2019t know how to spell a cough.\n[Writes as Algernon speaks.]\n\nALGERNON.\n[Speaking very rapidly.] Cecily, ever since I first looked upon your\nwonderful and incomparable beauty, I have dared to love you wildly,\npassionately, devotedly, hopelessly.\n\nCECILY.\nI don\u2019t think that you should tell me that you love me wildly,\npassionately, devotedly, hopelessly. Hopelessly doesn\u2019t seem to make\nmuch sense, does it?\n\nALGERNON.\nCecily!\n\n[Enter Merriman.]\n\nMERRIMAN.\nThe dog-cart is waiting, sir.\n\nALGERNON.\nTell it to come round next week, at the same hour.\n\nMERRIMAN.\n[Looks at Cecily, who makes no sign.] Yes, sir.\n\n[Merriman retires.]\n\nCECILY.\nUncle Jack would be very much annoyed if he knew you were staying on\ntill next week, at the same hour.\n\nALGERNON.\nOh, I don\u2019t care about Jack. I don\u2019t care for anybody in the whole\nworld but you. I love you, Cecily. You will marry me, won\u2019t you?\n\nCECILY.\nYou silly boy! Of course. Why, we have been engaged for the last three\nmonths.\n\nALGERNON.\nFor the last three months?\n\nCECILY.\nYes, it will be exactly three months on Thursday.\n\nALGERNON.\nBut how did we become engaged?\n\nCECILY.\nWell, ever since dear Uncle Jack first confessed to us that he had a\nyounger brother who was very wicked and bad, you of course have formed\nthe chief topic of conversation between myself and Miss Prism. And of\ncourse a man who is much talked about is always very attractive. One\nfeels there must be something in him, after all. I daresay it was\nfoolish of me, but I fell in love with you, Ernest.\n\nALGERNON.\nDarling! And when was the engagement actually settled?\n\nCECILY.\nOn the 14th of February last. Worn out by your entire ignorance of my\nexistence, I determined to end the matter one way or the other, and\nafter a long struggle with myself I accepted you under this dear old\ntree here. The next day I bought this little ring in your name, and\nthis is the little bangle with the true lover\u2019s knot I promised you\nalways to wear.\n\nALGERNON.\nDid I give you this? It\u2019s very pretty, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCECILY.\nYes, you\u2019ve wonderfully good taste, Ernest. It\u2019s the excuse I\u2019ve always\ngiven for your leading such a bad life. And this is the box in which I\nkeep all your dear letters. [Kneels at table, opens box, and produces\nletters tied up with blue ribbon.]\n\nALGERNON.\nMy letters! But, my own sweet Cecily, I have never written you any\nletters.\n\nCECILY.\nYou need hardly remind me of that, Ernest. I remember only too well\nthat I was forced to write your letters for you. I wrote always three\ntimes a week, and sometimes oftener.\n\nALGERNON.\nOh, do let me read them, Cecily?\n\nCECILY.\nOh, I couldn\u2019t possibly. They would make you far too conceited.\n[Replaces box.] The three you wrote me after I had broken off the\nengagement are so beautiful, and so badly spelled, that even now I can\nhardly read them without crying a little.\n\nALGERNON.\nBut was our engagement ever broken off?\n\nCECILY.\nOf course it was. On the 22nd of last March. You can see the entry if\nyou like. [Shows diary.] \u2018To-day I broke off my engagement with Ernest.\nI feel it is better to do so. The weather still continues charming.\u2019\n\nALGERNON.\nBut why on earth did you break it off? What had I done? I had done\nnothing at all. Cecily, I am very much hurt indeed to hear you broke it\noff. Particularly when the weather was so charming.\n\nCECILY.\nIt would hardly have been a really serious engagement if it hadn\u2019t been\nbroken off at least once. But I forgave you before the week was out.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Crossing to her, and kneeling.] What a perfect angel you are, Cecily.\n\nCECILY.\nYou dear romantic boy. [He kisses her, she puts her fingers through his\nhair.] I hope your hair curls naturally, does it?\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, darling, with a little help from others.\n\nCECILY.\nI am so glad.\n\nALGERNON.\nYou\u2019ll never break off our engagement again, Cecily?\n\nCECILY.\nI don\u2019t think I could break it off now that I have actually met you.\nBesides, of course, there is the question of your name.\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, of course. [Nervously.]\n\nCECILY.\nYou must not laugh at me, darling, but it had always been a girlish\ndream of mine to love some one whose name was Ernest. [Algernon rises,\nCecily also.] There is something in that name that seems to inspire\nabsolute confidence. I pity any poor married woman whose husband is not\ncalled Ernest.\n\nALGERNON.\nBut, my dear child, do you mean to say you could not love me if I had\nsome other name?\n\nCECILY.\nBut what name?\n\nALGERNON.\nOh, any name you like\u2014Algernon\u2014for instance . . .\n\nCECILY.\nBut I don\u2019t like the name of Algernon.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, my own dear, sweet, loving little darling, I really can\u2019t see why\nyou should object to the name of Algernon. It is not at all a bad name.\nIn fact, it is rather an aristocratic name. Half of the chaps who get\ninto the Bankruptcy Court are called Algernon. But seriously, Cecily .\n. . [Moving to her] . . . if my name was Algy, couldn\u2019t you love me?\n\nCECILY.\n[Rising.] I might respect you, Ernest, I might admire your character,\nbut I fear that I should not be able to give you my undivided\nattention.\n\nALGERNON.\nAhem! Cecily! [Picking up hat.] Your Rector here is, I suppose,\nthoroughly experienced in the practice of all the rites and ceremonials\nof the Church?\n\nCECILY.\nOh, yes. Dr. Chasuble is a most learned man. He has never written a\nsingle book, so you can imagine how much he knows.\n\nALGERNON.\nI must see him at once on a most important christening\u2014I mean on most\nimportant business.\n\nCECILY.\nOh!\n\nALGERNON.\nI shan\u2019t be away more than half an hour.\n\nCECILY.\nConsidering that we have been engaged since February the 14th, and that\nI only met you to-day for the first time, I think it is rather hard\nthat you should leave me for so long a period as half an hour. Couldn\u2019t\nyou make it twenty minutes?\n\nALGERNON.\nI\u2019ll be back in no time.\n\n[Kisses her and rushes down the garden.]\n\nCECILY.\nWhat an impetuous boy he is! I like his hair so much. I must enter his\nproposal in my diary.\n\n[Enter Merriman.]\n\nMERRIMAN.\nA Miss Fairfax has just called to see Mr. Worthing. On very important\nbusiness, Miss Fairfax states.\n\nCECILY.\nIsn\u2019t Mr. Worthing in his library?\n\nMERRIMAN.\nMr. Worthing went over in the direction of the Rectory some time ago.\n\nCECILY.\nPray ask the lady to come out here; Mr. Worthing is sure to be back\nsoon. And you can bring tea.\n\nMERRIMAN.\nYes, Miss. [Goes out.]\n\nCECILY.\nMiss Fairfax! I suppose one of the many good elderly women who are\nassociated with Uncle Jack in some of his philanthropic work in London.\nI don\u2019t quite like women who are interested in philanthropic work. I\nthink it is so forward of them.\n\n[Enter Merriman.]\n\nMERRIMAN.\nMiss Fairfax.\n\n[Enter Gwendolen.]\n\n[Exit Merriman.]\n\nCECILY.\n[Advancing to meet her.] Pray let me introduce myself to you. My name\nis Cecily Cardew.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nCecily Cardew? [Moving to her and shaking hands.] What a very sweet\nname! Something tells me that we are going to be great friends. I like\nyou already more than I can say. My first impressions of people are\nnever wrong.\n\nCECILY.\nHow nice of you to like me so much after we have known each other such\na comparatively short time. Pray sit down.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Still standing up.] I may call you Cecily, may I not?\n\nCECILY.\nWith pleasure!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nAnd you will always call me Gwendolen, won\u2019t you?\n\nCECILY.\nIf you wish.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThen that is all quite settled, is it not?\n\nCECILY.\nI hope so. [A pause. They both sit down together.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nPerhaps this might be a favourable opportunity for my mentioning who I\nam. My father is Lord Bracknell. You have never heard of papa, I\nsuppose?\n\nCECILY.\nI don\u2019t think so.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nOutside the family circle, papa, I am glad to say, is entirely unknown.\nI think that is quite as it should be. The home seems to me to be the\nproper sphere for the man. And certainly once a man begins to neglect\nhis domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate, does he not? And I\ndon\u2019t like that. It makes men so very attractive. Cecily, mamma, whose\nviews on education are remarkably strict, has brought me up to be\nextremely short-sighted; it is part of her system; so do you mind my\nlooking at you through my glasses?\n\nCECILY.\nOh! not at all, Gwendolen. I am very fond of being looked at.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[After examining Cecily carefully through a lorgnette.] You are here on\na short visit, I suppose.\n\nCECILY.\nOh no! I live here.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Severely.] Really? Your mother, no doubt, or some female relative of\nadvanced years, resides here also?\n\nCECILY.\nOh no! I have no mother, nor, in fact, any relations.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nIndeed?\n\nCECILY.\nMy dear guardian, with the assistance of Miss Prism, has the arduous\ntask of looking after me.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYour guardian?\n\nCECILY.\nYes, I am Mr. Worthing\u2019s ward.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nOh! It is strange he never mentioned to me that he had a ward. How\nsecretive of him! He grows more interesting hourly. I am not sure,\nhowever, that the news inspires me with feelings of unmixed delight.\n[Rising and going to her.] I am very fond of you, Cecily; I have liked\nyou ever since I met you! But I am bound to state that now that I know\nthat you are Mr. Worthing\u2019s ward, I cannot help expressing a wish you\nwere\u2014well, just a little older than you seem to be\u2014and not quite so\nvery alluring in appearance. In fact, if I may speak candidly\u2014\n\nCECILY.\nPray do! I think that whenever one has anything unpleasant to say, one\nshould always be quite candid.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nWell, to speak with perfect candour, Cecily, I wish that you were fully\nforty-two, and more than usually plain for your age. Ernest has a\nstrong upright nature. He is the very soul of truth and honour.\nDisloyalty would be as impossible to him as deception. But even men of\nthe noblest possible moral character are extremely susceptible to the\ninfluence of the physical charms of others. Modern, no less than\nAncient History, supplies us with many most painful examples of what I\nrefer to. If it were not so, indeed, History would be quite unreadable.\n\nCECILY.\nI beg your pardon, Gwendolen, did you say Ernest?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYes.\n\nCECILY.\nOh, but it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is my guardian. It is his\nbrother\u2014his elder brother.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Sitting down again.] Ernest never mentioned to me that he had a\nbrother.\n\nCECILY.\nI am sorry to say they have not been on good terms for a long time.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nAh! that accounts for it. And now that I think of it I have never heard\nany man mention his brother. The subject seems distasteful to most men.\nCecily, you have lifted a load from my mind. I was growing almost\nanxious. It would have been terrible if any cloud had come across a\nfriendship like ours, would it not? Of course you are quite, quite sure\nthat it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is your guardian?\n\nCECILY.\nQuite sure. [A pause.] In fact, I am going to be his.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Inquiringly.] I beg your pardon?\n\nCECILY.\n[Rather shy and confidingly.] Dearest Gwendolen, there is no reason why\nI should make a secret of it to you. Our little county newspaper is\nsure to chronicle the fact next week. Mr. Ernest Worthing and I are\nengaged to be married.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Quite politely, rising.] My darling Cecily, I think there must be some\nslight error. Mr. Ernest Worthing is engaged to me. The announcement\nwill appear in the _Morning Post_ on Saturday at the latest.\n\nCECILY.\n[Very politely, rising.] I am afraid you must be under some\nmisconception. Ernest proposed to me exactly ten minutes ago. [Shows\ndiary.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Examines diary through her lorgnettte carefully.] It is certainly very\ncurious, for he asked me to be his wife yesterday afternoon at 5.30. If\nyou would care to verify the incident, pray do so. [Produces diary of\nher own.] I never travel without my diary. One should always have\nsomething sensational to read in the train. I am so sorry, dear Cecily,\nif it is any disappointment to you, but I am afraid I have the prior\nclaim.\n\nCECILY.\nIt would distress me more than I can tell you, dear Gwendolen, if it\ncaused you any mental or physical anguish, but I feel bound to point\nout that since Ernest proposed to you he clearly has changed his mind.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Meditatively.] If the poor fellow has been entrapped into any foolish\npromise I shall consider it my duty to rescue him at once, and with a\nfirm hand.\n\nCECILY.\n[Thoughtfully and sadly.] Whatever unfortunate entanglement my dear boy\nmay have got into, I will never reproach him with it after we are\nmarried.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nDo you allude to me, Miss Cardew, as an entanglement? You are\npresumptuous. On an occasion of this kind it becomes more than a moral\nduty to speak one\u2019s mind. It becomes a pleasure.\n\nCECILY.\nDo you suggest, Miss Fairfax, that I entrapped Ernest into an\nengagement? How dare you? This is no time for wearing the shallow mask\nof manners. When I see a spade I call it a spade.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Satirically.] I am glad to say that I have never seen a spade. It is\nobvious that our social spheres have been widely different.\n\n[Enter Merriman, followed by the footman. He carries a salver, table\ncloth, and plate stand. Cecily is about to retort. The presence of the\nservants exercises a restraining influence, under which both girls\nchafe.]\n\nMERRIMAN.\nShall I lay tea here as usual, Miss?\n\nCECILY.\n[Sternly, in a calm voice.] Yes, as usual. [Merriman begins to clear\ntable and lay cloth. A long pause. Cecily and Gwendolen glare at each\nother.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nAre there many interesting walks in the vicinity, Miss Cardew?\n\nCECILY.\nOh! yes! a great many. From the top of one of the hills quite close one\ncan see five counties.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nFive counties! I don\u2019t think I should like that; I hate crowds.\n\nCECILY.\n[Sweetly.] I suppose that is why you live in town? [Gwendolen bites her\nlip, and beats her foot nervously with her parasol.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Looking round.] Quite a well-kept garden this is, Miss Cardew.\n\nCECILY.\nSo glad you like it, Miss Fairfax.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI had no idea there were any flowers in the country.\n\nCECILY.\nOh, flowers are as common here, Miss Fairfax, as people are in London.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nPersonally I cannot understand how anybody manages to exist in the\ncountry, if anybody who is anybody does. The country always bores me to\ndeath.\n\nCECILY.\nAh! This is what the newspapers call agricultural depression, is it\nnot? I believe the aristocracy are suffering very much from it just at\npresent. It is almost an epidemic amongst them, I have been told. May I\noffer you some tea, Miss Fairfax?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[With elaborate politeness.] Thank you. [Aside.] Detestable girl! But I\nrequire tea!\n\nCECILY.\n[Sweetly.] Sugar?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Superciliously.] No, thank you. Sugar is not fashionable any more.\n[Cecily looks angrily at her, takes up the tongs and puts four lumps of\nsugar into the cup.]\n\nCECILY.\n[Severely.] Cake or bread and butter?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[In a bored manner.] Bread and butter, please. Cake is rarely seen at\nthe best houses nowadays.\n\nCECILY.\n[Cuts a very large slice of cake, and puts it on the tray.] Hand that\nto Miss Fairfax.\n\n[Merriman does so, and goes out with footman. Gwendolen drinks the tea\nand makes a grimace. Puts down cup at once, reaches out her hand to the\nbread and butter, looks at it, and finds it is cake. Rises in\nindignation.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYou have filled my tea with lumps of sugar, and though I asked most\ndistinctly for bread and butter, you have given me cake. I am known for\nthe gentleness of my disposition, and the extraordinary sweetness of my\nnature, but I warn you, Miss Cardew, you may go too far.\n\nCECILY.\n[Rising.] To save my poor, innocent, trusting boy from the machinations\nof any other girl there are no lengths to which I would not go.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nFrom the moment I saw you I distrusted you. I felt that you were false\nand deceitful. I am never deceived in such matters. My first\nimpressions of people are invariably right.\n\nCECILY.\nIt seems to me, Miss Fairfax, that I am trespassing on your valuable\ntime. No doubt you have many other calls of a similar character to make\nin the neighbourhood.\n\n[Enter Jack.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Catching sight of him.] Ernest! My own Ernest!\n\nJACK.\nGwendolen! Darling! [Offers to kiss her.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Draws back.] A moment! May I ask if you are engaged to be married to\nthis young lady? [Points to Cecily.]\n\nJACK.\n[Laughing.] To dear little Cecily! Of course not! What could have put\nsuch an idea into your pretty little head?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThank you. You may! [Offers her cheek.]\n\nCECILY.\n[Very sweetly.] I knew there must be some misunderstanding, Miss\nFairfax. The gentleman whose arm is at present round your waist is my\nguardian, Mr. John Worthing.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI beg your pardon?\n\nCECILY.\nThis is Uncle Jack.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Receding.] Jack! Oh!\n\n[Enter Algernon.]\n\nCECILY.\nHere is Ernest.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Goes straight over to Cecily without noticing any one else.] My own\nlove! [Offers to kiss her.]\n\nCECILY.\n[Drawing back.] A moment, Ernest! May I ask you\u2014are you engaged to be\nmarried to this young lady?\n\nALGERNON.\n[Looking round.] To what young lady? Good heavens! Gwendolen!\n\nCECILY.\nYes! to good heavens, Gwendolen, I mean to Gwendolen.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Laughing.] Of course not! What could have put such an idea into your\npretty little head?\n\nCECILY.\nThank you. [Presenting her cheek to be kissed.] You may. [Algernon\nkisses her.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI felt there was some slight error, Miss Cardew. The gentleman who is\nnow embracing you is my cousin, Mr. Algernon Moncrieff.\n\nCECILY.\n[Breaking away from Algernon.] Algernon Moncrieff! Oh! [The two girls\nmove towards each other and put their arms round each other\u2019s waists as\nif for protection.]\n\nCECILY.\nAre you called Algernon?\n\nALGERNON.\nI cannot deny it.\n\nCECILY.\nOh!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nIs your name really John?\n\nJACK.\n[Standing rather proudly.] I could deny it if I liked. I could deny\nanything if I liked. But my name certainly is John. It has been John\nfor years.\n\nCECILY.\n[To Gwendolen.] A gross deception has been practised on both of us.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nMy poor wounded Cecily!\n\nCECILY.\nMy sweet wronged Gwendolen!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Slowly and seriously.] You will call me sister, will you not? [They\nembrace. Jack and Algernon groan and walk up and down.]\n\nCECILY.\n[Rather brightly.] There is just one question I would like to be\nallowed to ask my guardian.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nAn admirable idea! Mr. Worthing, there is just one question I would\nlike to be permitted to put to you. Where is your brother Ernest? We\nare both engaged to be married to your brother Ernest, so it is a\nmatter of some importance to us to know where your brother Ernest is at\npresent.\n\nJACK.\n[Slowly and hesitatingly.] Gwendolen\u2014Cecily\u2014it is very painful for me\nto be forced to speak the truth. It is the first time in my life that I\nhave ever been reduced to such a painful position, and I am really\nquite inexperienced in doing anything of the kind. However, I will tell\nyou quite frankly that I have no brother Ernest. I have no brother at\nall. I never had a brother in my life, and I certainly have not the\nsmallest intention of ever having one in the future.\n\nCECILY.\n[Surprised.] No brother at all?\n\nJACK.\n[Cheerily.] None!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Severely.] Had you never a brother of any kind?\n\nJACK.\n[Pleasantly.] Never. Not even of any kind.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI am afraid it is quite clear, Cecily, that neither of us is engaged to\nbe married to any one.\n\nCECILY.\nIt is not a very pleasant position for a young girl suddenly to find\nherself in. Is it?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nLet us go into the house. They will hardly venture to come after us\nthere.\n\nCECILY.\nNo, men are so cowardly, aren\u2019t they?\n\n[They retire into the house with scornful looks.]\n\nJACK.\nThis ghastly state of things is what you call Bunburying, I suppose?\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, and a perfectly wonderful Bunbury it is. The most wonderful\nBunbury I have ever had in my life.\n\nJACK.\nWell, you\u2019ve no right whatsoever to Bunbury here.\n\nALGERNON.\nThat is absurd. One has a right to Bunbury anywhere one chooses. Every\nserious Bunburyist knows that.\n\nJACK.\nSerious Bunburyist! Good heavens!\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, one must be serious about something, if one wants to have any\namusement in life. I happen to be serious about Bunburying. What on\nearth you are serious about I haven\u2019t got the remotest idea. About\neverything, I should fancy. You have such an absolutely trivial nature.\n\nJACK.\nWell, the only small satisfaction I have in the whole of this wretched\nbusiness is that your friend Bunbury is quite exploded. You won\u2019t be\nable to run down to the country quite so often as you used to do, dear\nAlgy. And a very good thing too.\n\nALGERNON.\nYour brother is a little off colour, isn\u2019t he, dear Jack? You won\u2019t be\nable to disappear to London quite so frequently as your wicked custom\nwas. And not a bad thing either.\n\nJACK.\nAs for your conduct towards Miss Cardew, I must say that your taking in\na sweet, simple, innocent girl like that is quite inexcusable. To say\nnothing of the fact that she is my ward.\n\nALGERNON.\nI can see no possible defence at all for your deceiving a brilliant,\nclever, thoroughly experienced young lady like Miss Fairfax. To say\nnothing of the fact that she is my cousin.\n\nJACK.\nI wanted to be engaged to Gwendolen, that is all. I love her.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, I simply wanted to be engaged to Cecily. I adore her.\n\nJACK.\nThere is certainly no chance of your marrying Miss Cardew.\n\nALGERNON.\nI don\u2019t think there is much likelihood, Jack, of you and Miss Fairfax\nbeing united.\n\nJACK.\nWell, that is no business of yours.\n\nALGERNON.\nIf it was my business, I wouldn\u2019t talk about it. [Begins to eat\nmuffins.] It is very vulgar to talk about one\u2019s business. Only people\nlike stock-brokers do that, and then merely at dinner parties.\n\nJACK.\nHow can you sit there, calmly eating muffins when we are in this\nhorrible trouble, I can\u2019t make out. You seem to me to be perfectly\nheartless.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, I can\u2019t eat muffins in an agitated manner. The butter would\nprobably get on my cuffs. One should always eat muffins quite calmly.\nIt is the only way to eat them.\n\nJACK.\nI say it\u2019s perfectly heartless your eating muffins at all, under the\ncircumstances.\n\nALGERNON.\nWhen I am in trouble, eating is the only thing that consoles me.\nIndeed, when I am in really great trouble, as any one who knows me\nintimately will tell you, I refuse everything except food and drink. At\nthe present moment I am eating muffins because I am unhappy. Besides, I\nam particularly fond of muffins. [Rising.]\n\nJACK.\n[Rising.] Well, that is no reason why you should eat them all in that\ngreedy way. [Takes muffins from Algernon.]\n\nALGERNON.\n[Offering tea-cake.] I wish you would have tea-cake instead. I don\u2019t\nlike tea-cake.\n\nJACK.\nGood heavens! I suppose a man may eat his own muffins in his own\ngarden.\n\nALGERNON.\nBut you have just said it was perfectly heartless to eat muffins.\n\nJACK.\nI said it was perfectly heartless of you, under the circumstances. That\nis a very different thing.\n\nALGERNON.\nThat may be. But the muffins are the same. [He seizes the muffin-dish\nfrom Jack.]\n\nJACK.\nAlgy, I wish to goodness you would go.\n\nALGERNON.\nYou can\u2019t possibly ask me to go without having some dinner. It\u2019s\nabsurd. I never go without my dinner. No one ever does, except\nvegetarians and people like that. Besides I have just made arrangements\nwith Dr. Chasuble to be christened at a quarter to six under the name\nof Ernest.\n\nJACK.\nMy dear fellow, the sooner you give up that nonsense the better. I made\narrangements this morning with Dr. Chasuble to be christened myself at\n5.30, and I naturally will take the name of Ernest. Gwendolen would\nwish it. We can\u2019t both be christened Ernest. It\u2019s absurd. Besides, I\nhave a perfect right to be christened if I like. There is no evidence\nat all that I have ever been christened by anybody. I should think it\nextremely probable I never was, and so does Dr. Chasuble. It is\nentirely different in your case. You have been christened already.\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, but I have not been christened for years.\n\nJACK.\nYes, but you have been christened. That is the important thing.\n\nALGERNON.\nQuite so. So I know my constitution can stand it. If you are not quite\nsure about your ever having been christened, I must say I think it\nrather dangerous your venturing on it now. It might make you very\nunwell. You can hardly have forgotten that some one very closely\nconnected with you was very nearly carried off this week in Paris by a\nsevere chill.\n\nJACK.\nYes, but you said yourself that a severe chill was not hereditary.\n\nALGERNON.\nIt usen\u2019t to be, I know\u2014but I daresay it is now. Science is always\nmaking wonderful improvements in things.\n\nJACK.\n[Picking up the muffin-dish.] Oh, that is nonsense; you are always\ntalking nonsense.\n\nALGERNON.\nJack, you are at the muffins again! I wish you wouldn\u2019t. There are only\ntwo left. [Takes them.] I told you I was particularly fond of muffins.\n\nJACK.\nBut I hate tea-cake.\n\nALGERNON.\nWhy on earth then do you allow tea-cake to be served up for your\nguests? What ideas you have of hospitality!\n\nJACK.\nAlgernon! I have already told you to go. I don\u2019t want you here. Why\ndon\u2019t you go!\n\nALGERNON.\nI haven\u2019t quite finished my tea yet! and there is still one muffin\nleft. [Jack groans, and sinks into a chair. Algernon still continues\neating.]\n\nACT DROP\n\n\n\n\nTHIRD ACT\n\nSCENE\n\nMorning-room at the Manor House.\n\n[Gwendolen and Cecily are at the window, looking out into the garden.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThe fact that they did not follow us at once into the house, as any one\nelse would have done, seems to me to show that they have some sense of\nshame left.\n\nCECILY.\nThey have been eating muffins. That looks like repentance.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[After a pause.] They don\u2019t seem to notice us at all. Couldn\u2019t you\ncough?\n\nCECILY.\nBut I haven\u2019t got a cough.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThey\u2019re looking at us. What effrontery!\n\nCECILY.\nThey\u2019re approaching. That\u2019s very forward of them.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nLet us preserve a dignified silence.\n\nCECILY.\nCertainly. It\u2019s the only thing to do now. [Enter Jack followed by\nAlgernon. They whistle some dreadful popular air from a British Opera.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThis dignified silence seems to produce an unpleasant effect.\n\nCECILY.\nA most distasteful one.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nBut we will not be the first to speak.\n\nCECILY.\nCertainly not.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nMr. Worthing, I have something very particular to ask you. Much depends\non your reply.\n\nCECILY.\nGwendolen, your common sense is invaluable. Mr. Moncrieff, kindly\nanswer me the following question. Why did you pretend to be my\nguardian\u2019s brother?\n\nALGERNON.\nIn order that I might have an opportunity of meeting you.\n\nCECILY.\n[To Gwendolen.] That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does\nit not?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYes, dear, if you can believe him.\n\nCECILY.\nI don\u2019t. But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of his answer.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nTrue. In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity is the vital\nthing. Mr. Worthing, what explanation can you offer to me for\npretending to have a brother? Was it in order that you might have an\nopportunity of coming up to town to see me as often as possible?\n\nJACK.\nCan you doubt it, Miss Fairfax?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI have the gravest doubts upon the subject. But I intend to crush them.\nThis is not the moment for German scepticism. [Moving to Cecily.] Their\nexplanations appear to be quite satisfactory, especially Mr.\nWorthing\u2019s. That seems to me to have the stamp of truth upon it.\n\nCECILY.\nI am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said. His voice alone\ninspires one with absolute credulity.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThen you think we should forgive them?\n\nCECILY.\nYes. I mean no.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nTrue! I had forgotten. There are principles at stake that one cannot\nsurrender. Which of us should tell them? The task is not a pleasant\none.\n\nCECILY.\nCould we not both speak at the same time?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nAn excellent idea! I nearly always speak at the same time as other\npeople. Will you take the time from me?\n\nCECILY.\nCertainly. [Gwendolen beats time with uplifted finger.]\n\nGWENDOLEN and CECILY [Speaking together.] Your Christian names are\nstill an insuperable barrier. That is all!\n\nJACK and ALGERNON [Speaking together.] Our Christian names! Is that\nall? But we are going to be christened this afternoon.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[To Jack.] For my sake you are prepared to do this terrible thing?\n\nJACK.\nI am.\n\nCECILY.\n[To Algernon.] To please me you are ready to face this fearful ordeal?\n\nALGERNON.\nI am!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nHow absurd to talk of the equality of the sexes! Where questions of\nself-sacrifice are concerned, men are infinitely beyond us.\n\nJACK.\nWe are. [Clasps hands with Algernon.]\n\nCECILY.\nThey have moments of physical courage of which we women know absolutely\nnothing.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[To Jack.] Darling!\n\nALGERNON.\n[To Cecily.] Darling! [They fall into each other\u2019s arms.]\n\n[Enter Merriman. When he enters he coughs loudly, seeing the\nsituation.]\n\nMERRIMAN.\nAhem! Ahem! Lady Bracknell!\n\nJACK.\nGood heavens!\n\n[Enter Lady Bracknell. The couples separate in alarm. Exit Merriman.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nGwendolen! What does this mean?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nMerely that I am engaged to be married to Mr. Worthing, mamma.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nCome here. Sit down. Sit down immediately. Hesitation of any kind is a\nsign of mental decay in the young, of physical weakness in the old.\n[Turns to Jack.] Apprised, sir, of my daughter\u2019s sudden flight by her\ntrusty maid, whose confidence I purchased by means of a small coin, I\nfollowed her at once by a luggage train. Her unhappy father is, I am\nglad to say, under the impression that she is attending a more than\nusually lengthy lecture by the University Extension Scheme on the\nInfluence of a permanent income on Thought. I do not propose to\nundeceive him. Indeed I have never undeceived him on any question. I\nwould consider it wrong. But of course, you will clearly understand\nthat all communication between yourself and my daughter must cease\nimmediately from this moment. On this point, as indeed on all points, I\nam firm.\n\nJACK.\nI am engaged to be married to Gwendolen, Lady Bracknell!\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nYou are nothing of the kind, sir. And now, as regards Algernon! . . .\nAlgernon!\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nMay I ask if it is in this house that your invalid friend Mr. Bunbury\nresides?\n\nALGERNON.\n[Stammering.] Oh! No! Bunbury doesn\u2019t live here. Bunbury is somewhere\nelse at present. In fact, Bunbury is dead.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nDead! When did Mr. Bunbury die? His death must have been extremely\nsudden.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Airily.] Oh! I killed Bunbury this afternoon. I mean poor Bunbury died\nthis afternoon.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nWhat did he die of?\n\nALGERNON.\nBunbury? Oh, he was quite exploded.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nExploded! Was he the victim of a revolutionary outrage? I was not aware\nthat Mr. Bunbury was interested in social legislation. If so, he is\nwell punished for his morbidity.\n\nALGERNON.\nMy dear Aunt Augusta, I mean he was found out! The doctors found out\nthat Bunbury could not live, that is what I mean\u2014so Bunbury died.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nHe seems to have had great confidence in the opinion of his physicians.\nI am glad, however, that he made up his mind at the last to some\ndefinite course of action, and acted under proper medical advice. And\nnow that we have finally got rid of this Mr. Bunbury, may I ask, Mr.\nWorthing, who is that young person whose hand my nephew Algernon is now\nholding in what seems to me a peculiarly unnecessary manner?\n\nJACK.\nThat lady is Miss Cecily Cardew, my ward. [Lady Bracknell bows coldly\nto Cecily.]\n\nALGERNON.\nI am engaged to be married to Cecily, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nI beg your pardon?\n\nCECILY.\nMr. Moncrieff and I are engaged to be married, Lady Bracknell.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[With a shiver, crossing to the sofa and sitting down.] I do not know\nwhether there is anything peculiarly exciting in the air of this\nparticular part of Hertfordshire, but the number of engagements that go\non seems to me considerably above the proper average that statistics\nhave laid down for our guidance. I think some preliminary inquiry on my\npart would not be out of place. Mr. Worthing, is Miss Cardew at all\nconnected with any of the larger railway stations in London? I merely\ndesire information. Until yesterday I had no idea that there were any\nfamilies or persons whose origin was a Terminus. [Jack looks perfectly\nfurious, but restrains himself.]\n\nJACK.\n[In a clear, cold voice.] Miss Cardew is the grand-daughter of the late\nMr. Thomas Cardew of 149 Belgrave Square, S.W.; Gervase Park, Dorking,\nSurrey; and the Sporran, Fifeshire, N.B.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThat sounds not unsatisfactory. Three addresses always inspire\nconfidence, even in tradesmen. But what proof have I of their\nauthenticity?\n\nJACK.\nI have carefully preserved the Court Guides of the period. They are\nopen to your inspection, Lady Bracknell.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Grimly.] I have known strange errors in that publication.\n\nJACK.\nMiss Cardew\u2019s family solicitors are Messrs. Markby, Markby, and Markby.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nMarkby, Markby, and Markby? A firm of the very highest position in\ntheir profession. Indeed I am told that one of the Mr. Markby\u2019s is\noccasionally to be seen at dinner parties. So far I am satisfied.\n\nJACK.\n[Very irritably.] How extremely kind of you, Lady Bracknell! I have\nalso in my possession, you will be pleased to hear, certificates of\nMiss Cardew\u2019s birth, baptism, whooping cough, registration,\nvaccination, confirmation, and the measles; both the German and the\nEnglish variety.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nAh! A life crowded with incident, I see; though perhaps somewhat too\nexciting for a young girl. I am not myself in favour of premature\nexperiences. [Rises, looks at her watch.] Gwendolen! the time\napproaches for our departure. We have not a moment to lose. As a matter\nof form, Mr. Worthing, I had better ask you if Miss Cardew has any\nlittle fortune?\n\nJACK.\nOh! about a hundred and thirty thousand pounds in the Funds. That is\nall. Goodbye, Lady Bracknell. So pleased to have seen you.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Sitting down again.] A moment, Mr. Worthing. A hundred and thirty\nthousand pounds! And in the Funds! Miss Cardew seems to me a most\nattractive young lady, now that I look at her. Few girls of the present\nday have any really solid qualities, any of the qualities that last,\nand improve with time. We live, I regret to say, in an age of surfaces.\n[To Cecily.] Come over here, dear. [Cecily goes across.] Pretty child!\nyour dress is sadly simple, and your hair seems almost as Nature might\nhave left it. But we can soon alter all that. A thoroughly experienced\nFrench maid produces a really marvellous result in a very brief space\nof time. I remember recommending one to young Lady Lancing, and after\nthree months her own husband did not know her.\n\nJACK.\nAnd after six months nobody knew her.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Glares at Jack for a few moments. Then bends, with a practised smile,\nto Cecily.] Kindly turn round, sweet child. [Cecily turns completely\nround.] No, the side view is what I want. [Cecily presents her\nprofile.] Yes, quite as I expected. There are distinct social\npossibilities in your profile. The two weak points in our age are its\nwant of principle and its want of profile. The chin a little higher,\ndear. Style largely depends on the way the chin is worn. They are worn\nvery high, just at present. Algernon!\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, Aunt Augusta!\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThere are distinct social possibilities in Miss Cardew\u2019s profile.\n\nALGERNON.\nCecily is the sweetest, dearest, prettiest girl in the whole world. And\nI don\u2019t care twopence about social possibilities.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nNever speak disrespectfully of Society, Algernon. Only people who can\u2019t\nget into it do that. [To Cecily.] Dear child, of course you know that\nAlgernon has nothing but his debts to depend upon. But I do not approve\nof mercenary marriages. When I married Lord Bracknell I had no fortune\nof any kind. But I never dreamed for a moment of allowing that to stand\nin my way. Well, I suppose I must give my consent.\n\nALGERNON.\nThank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nCecily, you may kiss me!\n\nCECILY.\n[Kisses her.] Thank you, Lady Bracknell.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nYou may also address me as Aunt Augusta for the future.\n\nCECILY.\nThank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThe marriage, I think, had better take place quite soon.\n\nALGERNON.\nThank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\nCECILY.\nThank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nTo speak frankly, I am not in favour of long engagements. They give\npeople the opportunity of finding out each other\u2019s character before\nmarriage, which I think is never advisable.\n\nJACK.\nI beg your pardon for interrupting you, Lady Bracknell, but this\nengagement is quite out of the question. I am Miss Cardew\u2019s guardian,\nand she cannot marry without my consent until she comes of age. That\nconsent I absolutely decline to give.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nUpon what grounds may I ask? Algernon is an extremely, I may almost say\nan ostentatiously, eligible young man. He has nothing, but he looks\neverything. What more can one desire?\n\nJACK.\nIt pains me very much to have to speak frankly to you, Lady Bracknell,\nabout your nephew, but the fact is that I do not approve at all of his\nmoral character. I suspect him of being untruthful. [Algernon and\nCecily look at him in indignant amazement.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nUntruthful! My nephew Algernon? Impossible! He is an Oxonian.\n\nJACK.\nI fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter. This afternoon\nduring my temporary absence in London on an important question of\nromance, he obtained admission to my house by means of the false\npretence of being my brother. Under an assumed name he drank, I\u2019ve just\nbeen informed by my butler, an entire pint bottle of my Perrier-Jouet,\nBrut, \u201989; wine I was specially reserving for myself. Continuing his\ndisgraceful deception, he succeeded in the course of the afternoon in\nalienating the affections of my only ward. He subsequently stayed to\ntea, and devoured every single muffin. And what makes his conduct all\nthe more heartless is, that he was perfectly well aware from the first\nthat I have no brother, that I never had a brother, and that I don\u2019t\nintend to have a brother, not even of any kind. I distinctly told him\nso myself yesterday afternoon.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nAhem! Mr. Worthing, after careful consideration I have decided entirely\nto overlook my nephew\u2019s conduct to you.\n\nJACK.\nThat is very generous of you, Lady Bracknell. My own decision, however,\nis unalterable. I decline to give my consent.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[To Cecily.] Come here, sweet child. [Cecily goes over.] How old are\nyou, dear?\n\nCECILY.\nWell, I am really only eighteen, but I always admit to twenty when I go\nto evening parties.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nYou are perfectly right in making some slight alteration. Indeed, no\nwoman should ever be quite accurate about her age. It looks so\ncalculating . . . [In a meditative manner.] Eighteen, but admitting to\ntwenty at evening parties. Well, it will not be very long before you\nare of age and free from the restraints of tutelage. So I don\u2019t think\nyour guardian\u2019s consent is, after all, a matter of any importance.\n\nJACK.\nPray excuse me, Lady Bracknell, for interrupting you again, but it is\nonly fair to tell you that according to the terms of her grandfather\u2019s\nwill Miss Cardew does not come legally of age till she is thirty-five.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThat does not seem to me to be a grave objection. Thirty-five is a very\nattractive age. London society is full of women of the very highest\nbirth who have, of their own free choice, remained thirty-five for\nyears. Lady Dumbleton is an instance in point. To my own knowledge she\nhas been thirty-five ever since she arrived at the age of forty, which\nwas many years ago now. I see no reason why our dear Cecily should not\nbe even still more attractive at the age you mention than she is at\npresent. There will be a large accumulation of property.\n\nCECILY.\nAlgy, could you wait for me till I was thirty-five?\n\nALGERNON.\nOf course I could, Cecily. You know I could.\n\nCECILY.\nYes, I felt it instinctively, but I couldn\u2019t wait all that time. I hate\nwaiting even five minutes for anybody. It always makes me rather cross.\nI am not punctual myself, I know, but I do like punctuality in others,\nand waiting, even to be married, is quite out of the question.\n\nALGERNON.\nThen what is to be done, Cecily?\n\nCECILY.\nI don\u2019t know, Mr. Moncrieff.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nMy dear Mr. Worthing, as Miss Cardew states positively that she cannot\nwait till she is thirty-five\u2014a remark which I am bound to say seems to\nme to show a somewhat impatient nature\u2014I would beg of you to reconsider\nyour decision.\n\nJACK.\nBut my dear Lady Bracknell, the matter is entirely in your own hands.\nThe moment you consent to my marriage with Gwendolen, I will most\ngladly allow your nephew to form an alliance with my ward.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Rising and drawing herself up.] You must be quite aware that what you\npropose is out of the question.\n\nJACK.\nThen a passionate celibacy is all that any of us can look forward to.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThat is not the destiny I propose for Gwendolen. Algernon, of course,\ncan choose for himself. [Pulls out her watch.] Come, dear, [Gwendolen\nrises] we have already missed five, if not six, trains. To miss any\nmore might expose us to comment on the platform.\n\n[Enter Dr. Chasuble.]\n\nCHASUBLE.\nEverything is quite ready for the christenings.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThe christenings, sir! Is not that somewhat premature?\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[Looking rather puzzled, and pointing to Jack and Algernon.] Both these\ngentlemen have expressed a desire for immediate baptism.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nAt their age? The idea is grotesque and irreligious! Algernon, I forbid\nyou to be baptized. I will not hear of such excesses. Lord Bracknell\nwould be highly displeased if he learned that that was the way in which\nyou wasted your time and money.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nAm I to understand then that there are to be no christenings at all\nthis afternoon?\n\nJACK.\nI don\u2019t think that, as things are now, it would be of much practical\nvalue to either of us, Dr. Chasuble.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nI am grieved to hear such sentiments from you, Mr. Worthing. They\nsavour of the heretical views of the Anabaptists, views that I have\ncompletely refuted in four of my unpublished sermons. However, as your\npresent mood seems to be one peculiarly secular, I will return to the\nchurch at once. Indeed, I have just been informed by the pew-opener\nthat for the last hour and a half Miss Prism has been waiting for me in\nthe vestry.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Starting.] Miss Prism! Did I hear you mention a Miss Prism?\n\nCHASUBLE.\nYes, Lady Bracknell. I am on my way to join her.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nPray allow me to detain you for a moment. This matter may prove to be\none of vital importance to Lord Bracknell and myself. Is this Miss\nPrism a female of repellent aspect, remotely connected with education?\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[Somewhat indignantly.] She is the most cultivated of ladies, and the\nvery picture of respectability.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nIt is obviously the same person. May I ask what position she holds in\nyour household?\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[Severely.] I am a celibate, madam.\n\nJACK.\n[Interposing.] Miss Prism, Lady Bracknell, has been for the last three\nyears Miss Cardew\u2019s esteemed governess and valued companion.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nIn spite of what I hear of her, I must see her at once. Let her be sent\nfor.\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[Looking off.] She approaches; she is nigh.\n\n[Enter Miss Prism hurriedly.]\n\nMISS PRISM.\nI was told you expected me in the vestry, dear Canon. I have been\nwaiting for you there for an hour and three-quarters. [Catches sight of\nLady Bracknell, who has fixed her with a stony glare. Miss Prism grows\npale and quails. She looks anxiously round as if desirous to escape.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[In a severe, judicial voice.] Prism! [Miss Prism bows her head in\nshame.] Come here, Prism! [Miss Prism approaches in a humble manner.]\nPrism! Where is that baby? [General consternation. The Canon starts\nback in horror. Algernon and Jack pretend to be anxious to shield\nCecily and Gwendolen from hearing the details of a terrible public\nscandal.] Twenty-eight years ago, Prism, you left Lord Bracknell\u2019s\nhouse, Number 104, Upper Grosvenor Street, in charge of a perambulator\nthat contained a baby of the male sex. You never returned. A few weeks\nlater, through the elaborate investigations of the Metropolitan police,\nthe perambulator was discovered at midnight, standing by itself in a\nremote corner of Bayswater. It contained the manuscript of a\nthree-volume novel of more than usually revolting sentimentality. [Miss\nPrism starts in involuntary indignation.] But the baby was not there!\n[Every one looks at Miss Prism.] Prism! Where is that baby? [A pause.]\n\nMISS PRISM.\nLady Bracknell, I admit with shame that I do not know. I only wish I\ndid. The plain facts of the case are these. On the morning of the day\nyou mention, a day that is for ever branded on my memory, I prepared as\nusual to take the baby out in its perambulator. I had also with me a\nsomewhat old, but capacious hand-bag in which I had intended to place\nthe manuscript of a work of fiction that I had written during my few\nunoccupied hours. In a moment of mental abstraction, for which I never\ncan forgive myself, I deposited the manuscript in the basinette, and\nplaced the baby in the hand-bag.\n\nJACK.\n[Who has been listening attentively.] But where did you deposit the\nhand-bag?\n\nMISS PRISM.\nDo not ask me, Mr. Worthing.\n\nJACK.\nMiss Prism, this is a matter of no small importance to me. I insist on\nknowing where you deposited the hand-bag that contained that infant.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nI left it in the cloak-room of one of the larger railway stations in\nLondon.\n\nJACK.\nWhat railway station?\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Quite crushed.] Victoria. The Brighton line. [Sinks into a chair.]\n\nJACK.\nI must retire to my room for a moment. Gwendolen, wait here for me.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nIf you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my life. [Exit\nJack in great excitement.]\n\nCHASUBLE.\nWhat do you think this means, Lady Bracknell?\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nI dare not even suspect, Dr. Chasuble. I need hardly tell you that in\nfamilies of high position strange coincidences are not supposed to\noccur. They are hardly considered the thing.\n\n[Noises heard overhead as if some one was throwing trunks about. Every\none looks up.]\n\nCECILY.\nUncle Jack seems strangely agitated.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nYour guardian has a very emotional nature.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThis noise is extremely unpleasant. It sounds as if he was having an\nargument. I dislike arguments of any kind. They are always vulgar, and\noften convincing.\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[Looking up.] It has stopped now. [The noise is redoubled.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nI wish he would arrive at some conclusion.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThis suspense is terrible. I hope it will last. [Enter Jack with a\nhand-bag of black leather in his hand.]\n\nJACK.\n[Rushing over to Miss Prism.] Is this the hand-bag, Miss Prism? Examine\nit carefully before you speak. The happiness of more than one life\ndepends on your answer.\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Calmly.] It seems to be mine. Yes, here is the injury it received\nthrough the upsetting of a Gower Street omnibus in younger and happier\ndays. Here is the stain on the lining caused by the explosion of a\ntemperance beverage, an incident that occurred at Leamington. And here,\non the lock, are my initials. I had forgotten that in an extravagant\nmood I had had them placed there. The bag is undoubtedly mine. I am\ndelighted to have it so unexpectedly restored to me. It has been a\ngreat inconvenience being without it all these years.\n\nJACK.\n[In a pathetic voice.] Miss Prism, more is restored to you than this\nhand-bag. I was the baby you placed in it.\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Amazed.] You?\n\nJACK.\n[Embracing her.] Yes . . . mother!\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Recoiling in indignant astonishment.] Mr. Worthing! I am unmarried!\n\nJACK.\nUnmarried! I do not deny that is a serious blow. But after all, who has\nthe right to cast a stone against one who has suffered? Cannot\nrepentance wipe out an act of folly? Why should there be one law for\nmen, and another for women? Mother, I forgive you. [Tries to embrace\nher again.]\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Still more indignant.] Mr. Worthing, there is some error. [Pointing to\nLady Bracknell.] There is the lady who can tell you who you really are.\n\nJACK.\n[After a pause.] Lady Bracknell, I hate to seem inquisitive, but would\nyou kindly inform me who I am?\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nI am afraid that the news I have to give you will not altogether please\nyou. You are the son of my poor sister, Mrs. Moncrieff, and\nconsequently Algernon\u2019s elder brother.\n\nJACK.\nAlgy\u2019s elder brother! Then I have a brother after all. I knew I had a\nbrother! I always said I had a brother! Cecily,\u2014how could you have ever\ndoubted that I had a brother? [Seizes hold of Algernon.] Dr. Chasuble,\nmy unfortunate brother. Miss Prism, my unfortunate brother. Gwendolen,\nmy unfortunate brother. Algy, you young scoundrel, you will have to\ntreat me with more respect in the future. You have never behaved to me\nlike a brother in all your life.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, not till to-day, old boy, I admit. I did my best, however, though\nI was out of practice.\n\n[Shakes hands.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[To Jack.] My own! But what own are you? What is your Christian name,\nnow that you have become some one else?\n\nJACK.\nGood heavens! . . . I had quite forgotten that point. Your decision on\nthe subject of my name is irrevocable, I suppose?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI never change, except in my affections.\n\nCECILY.\nWhat a noble nature you have, Gwendolen!\n\nJACK.\nThen the question had better be cleared up at once. Aunt Augusta, a\nmoment. At the time when Miss Prism left me in the hand-bag, had I been\nchristened already?\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nEvery luxury that money could buy, including christening, had been\nlavished on you by your fond and doting parents.\n\nJACK.\nThen I was christened! That is settled. Now, what name was I given? Let\nme know the worst.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nBeing the eldest son you were naturally christened after your father.\n\nJACK.\n[Irritably.] Yes, but what was my father\u2019s Christian name?\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Meditatively.] I cannot at the present moment recall what the\nGeneral\u2019s Christian name was. But I have no doubt he had one. He was\neccentric, I admit. But only in later years. And that was the result of\nthe Indian climate, and marriage, and indigestion, and other things of\nthat kind.\n\nJACK.\nAlgy! Can\u2019t you recollect what our father\u2019s Christian name was?\n\nALGERNON.\nMy dear boy, we were never even on speaking terms. He died before I was\na year old.\n\nJACK.\nHis name would appear in the Army Lists of the period, I suppose, Aunt\nAugusta?\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThe General was essentially a man of peace, except in his domestic\nlife. But I have no doubt his name would appear in any military\ndirectory.\n\nJACK.\nThe Army Lists of the last forty years are here. These delightful\nrecords should have been my constant study. [Rushes to bookcase and\ntears the books out.] M. Generals . . . Mallam, Maxbohm, Magley, what\nghastly names they have\u2014Markby, Migsby, Mobbs, Moncrieff! Lieutenant\n1840, Captain, Lieutenant-Colonel, Colonel, General 1869, Christian\nnames, Ernest John. [Puts book very quietly down and speaks quite\ncalmly.] I always told you, Gwendolen, my name was Ernest, didn\u2019t I?\nWell, it is Ernest after all. I mean it naturally is Ernest.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nYes, I remember now that the General was called Ernest, I knew I had\nsome particular reason for disliking the name.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nErnest! My own Ernest! I felt from the first that you could have no\nother name!\n\nJACK.\nGwendolen, it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that\nall his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth. Can you\nforgive me?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI can. For I feel that you are sure to change.\n\nJACK.\nMy own one!\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[To Miss Prism.] L\u00e6titia! [Embraces her]\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Enthusiastically.] Frederick! At last!\n\nALGERNON.\nCecily! [Embraces her.] At last!\n\nJACK.\nGwendolen! [Embraces her.] At last!\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nMy nephew, you seem to be displaying signs of triviality.\n\nJACK.\nOn the contrary, Aunt Augusta, I\u2019ve now realised for the first time in\nmy life the vital Importance of Being Earnest.\n\nTABLEAU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST: A TRIVIAL COMEDY FOR SERIOUS PEOPLE ***\n\n\n    \n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

        "summary": "**Summary of \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" by Oscar Wilde**\n\n**Overview:**\n\"The Importance of Being Earnest\" is a comedic play by Oscar Wilde, first performed on February 14, 1895. It centers around two main characters, Jack Worthing and Algernon Moncrieff, who employ fictional identities to escape social obligations.\n\n**Main Characters:**\n- John Worthing (Jack)\n- Algernon Moncrieff\n- Lady Bracknell\n- Gwendolen Fairfax\n- Cecily Cardew\n- Miss Prism (governess)\n- Rev. Canon Chasuble, D.D.\n- Lane (servant)\n- Merriman (butler)\n\n**Plot Summary:**\n- **Act 1:** In Algernon's flat, Jack (who pretends to be Ernest in town) visits to propose to Gwendolen. Algernon mocks Jack's double life and reveals he has an invalid friend named Bunbury to escape obligations. Jack discusses his ward, Cecily, whom he plans to keep away from Algernon. \n\n- **Act 2:** Set in the garden at Jack's country house, Cecily meets Algernon, who pretends to be Jack's brother, Ernest. They fall for each other, unaware of the truth. The act reveals misunderstandings regarding identity and engagements between characters.\n\n- **Act 3:** In the morning-room, Gwendolen and Cecily confront their engagements to \"Ernest.\" Jack and Algernon reveal they have both been deceiving the women. Lady Bracknell enters and challenges the men's moral character, demanding background checks and family lineage. The truth about Jack's origins emerges, including the revelation that he was raised by Miss Prism, who lost him as a baby in a handbag.\n\n**Resolution:**\nUltimately, Jack discovers he is truly named Ernest, fulfilling the expectations of the women who prefer that name. Both couples become engaged, resolving the confusion over identities.\n\n**Themes:**\n- The nature of identity and deception.\n- Social expectations and hypocrisy.\n- The triviality of societal norms versus true affection.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWilde's play cleverly critiques Victorian society, revealing the absurdities of courtship and social status, while emphasizing the importance of being earnest about one's identity and intentions.",

LANYON\u2019S NARRATIVE\n\n HENRY JEKYLL\u2019S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n\nSTORY OF THE DOOR\n\nMr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was\nnever lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse;\nbackward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow\nlovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste,\nsomething eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which\nnever found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these\nsilent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in\nthe acts of his life. He was austere with himself; drank gin when he\nwas alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the\ntheatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he had\nan approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with\nenvy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and\nin any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove. \u201cI incline to\nCain\u2019s heresy,\u201d he used to say quaintly: \u201cI let my brother go to the\ndevil in his own way.\u201d In this character, it was frequently his fortune\nto be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in\nthe lives of downgoing men. And to such as these, so long as they came\nabout his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.\n\nNo doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative\nat the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar\ncatholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to accept\nhis friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that\nwas the lawyer\u2019s way. His friends were those of his own blood or those\nwhom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the\ngrowth of time, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt\nthe bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman,\nthe well-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for many, what\nthese two could see in each other, or what subject they could find in\ncommon. It was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday\nwalks, that they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail\nwith obvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two\nmen put the greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief\njewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but\neven resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them\nuninterrupted.\n\nIt chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a\nby-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what is\ncalled quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The\ninhabitants were all doing well, it seemed, and all emulously hoping to\ndo better still, and laying out the surplus of their gains in coquetry;\nso that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of\ninvitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday, when it\nveiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage,\nthe street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a fire\nin a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters, well-polished\nbrasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught\nand pleased the eye of the passenger.\n\nTwo doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was\nbroken by the entry of a court; and just at that point a certain\nsinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street. It\nwas two storeys high; showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower\nstorey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper; and bore\nin every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence. The\ndoor, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered\nand distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on\nthe panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had tried\nhis knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one had\nappeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their\nravages.\n\nMr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; but\nwhen they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane and\npointed.\n\n\u201cDid you ever remark that door?\u201d he asked; and when his companion had\nreplied in the affirmative, \u201cIt is connected in my mind,\u201d added he,\n\u201cwith a very odd story.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed?\u201d said Mr. Utterson, with a slight change of voice, \u201cand what\nwas that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it was this way,\u201d returned Mr. Enfield: \u201cI was coming home from\nsome place at the end of the world, about three o\u2019clock of a black\nwinter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was\nliterally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street and all the\nfolks asleep\u2014street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession\nand all as empty as a church\u2014till at last I got into that state of mind\nwhen a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a\npoliceman. All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was\nstumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe\neight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross\nstreet. Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at the\ncorner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man\ntrampled calmly over the child\u2019s body and left her screaming on the\nground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It wasn\u2019t\nlike a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a few halloa,\ntook to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where\nthere was already quite a group about the screaming child. He was\nperfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly\nthat it brought out the sweat on me like running. The people who had\nturned out were the girl\u2019s own family; and pretty soon, the doctor, for\nwhom she had been sent, put in his appearance. Well, the child was not\nmuch the worse, more frightened, according to the sawbones; and there\nyou might have supposed would be an end to it. But there was one\ncurious circumstance. I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first\nsight. So had the child\u2019s family, which was only natural. But the\ndoctor\u2019s case was what struck me. He was the usual cut and dry\napothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh\naccent and about as emotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the\nrest of us; every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that sawbones\nturn sick and white with the desire to kill him. I knew what was in his\nmind, just as he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of the\nquestion, we did the next best. We told the man we could and would make\nsuch a scandal out of this as should make his name stink from one end\nof London to the other. If he had any friends or any credit, we\nundertook that he should lose them. And all the time, as we were\npitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best we\ncould for they were as wild as harpies. I never saw a circle of such\nhateful faces; and there was the man in the middle, with a kind of\nblack sneering coolness\u2014frightened too, I could see that\u2014but carrying\nit off, sir, really like Satan. \u2018If you choose to make capital out of\nthis accident,\u2019 said he, \u2018I am naturally helpless. No gentleman but\nwishes to avoid a scene,\u2019 says he. \u2018Name your figure.\u2019 Well, we screwed\nhim up to a hundred pounds for the child\u2019s family; he would have\nclearly liked to stick out; but there was something about the lot of us\nthat meant mischief, and at last he struck. The next thing was to get\nthe money; and where do you think he carried us but to that place with\nthe door?\u2014whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with the\nmatter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts\u2019s,\ndrawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can\u2019t mention,\nthough it\u2019s one of the points of my story, but it was a name at least\nvery well known and often printed. The figure was stiff; but the\nsignature was good for more than that if it was only genuine. I took\nthe liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business\nlooked apocryphal, and that a man does not, in real life, walk into a\ncellar door at four in the morning and come out with another man\u2019s\ncheque for close upon a hundred pounds. But he was quite easy and\nsneering. \u2018Set your mind at rest,\u2019 says he, \u2018I will stay with you till\nthe banks open and cash the cheque myself.\u2019 So we all set off, the\ndoctor, and the child\u2019s father, and our friend and myself, and passed\nthe rest of the night in my chambers; and next day, when we had\nbreakfasted, went in a body to the bank. I gave in the cheque myself,\nand said I had every reason to believe it was a forgery. Not a bit of\nit. The cheque was genuine.\u201d\n\n\u201cTut-tut!\u201d said Mr. Utterson.\n\n\u201cI see you feel as I do,\u201d said Mr. Enfield. \u201cYes, it\u2019s a bad story. For\nmy man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really\ndamnable man; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of\nthe proprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one of your\nfellows who do what they call good. Blackmail, I suppose; an honest man\npaying through the nose for some of the capers of his youth. Black Mail\nHouse is what I call the place with the door, in consequence. Though\neven that, you know, is far from explaining all,\u201d he added, and with\nthe words fell into a vein of musing.\n\nFrom this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly: \u201cAnd\nyou don\u2019t know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?\u201d\n\n\u201cA likely place, isn\u2019t it?\u201d returned Mr. Enfield. \u201cBut I happen to have\nnoticed his address; he lives in some square or other.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you never asked about the\u2014place with the door?\u201d said Mr. Utterson.\n\n\u201cNo, sir; I had a delicacy,\u201d was the reply. \u201cI feel very strongly about\nputting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the day of\njudgment. You start a question, and it\u2019s like starting a stone. You sit\nquietly on the top of a hill; and away the stone goes, starting others;\nand presently some bland old bird (the last you would have thought of)\nis knocked on the head in his own back garden and the family have to\nchange their name. No sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks\nlike Queer Street, the less I ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cA very good rule, too,\u201d said the lawyer.\n\n\u201cBut I have studied the place for myself,\u201d continued Mr. Enfield. \u201cIt\nseems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody goes in or\nout of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of my\nadventure. There are three windows looking on the court on the first\nfloor; none below; the windows are always shut but they\u2019re clean. And\nthen there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so somebody must\nlive there. And yet it\u2019s not so sure; for the buildings are so packed\ntogether about the court, that it\u2019s hard to say where one ends and\nanother begins.\u201d\n\nThe pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then \u201cEnfield,\u201d\nsaid Mr. Utterson, \u201cthat\u2019s a good rule of yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I think it is,\u201d returned Enfield.\n\n\u201cBut for all that,\u201d continued the lawyer, \u201cthere\u2019s one point I want to\nask. I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Mr. Enfield, \u201cI can\u2019t see what harm it would do. It was a\nman of the name of Hyde.\u201d\n\n\u201cHm,\u201d said Mr. Utterson. \u201cWhat sort of a man is he to see?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is not easy to describe. There is something wrong with his\nappearance; something displeasing, something down-right detestable. I\nnever saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why. He must be\ndeformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although I\ncouldn\u2019t specify the point. He\u2019s an extraordinary looking man, and yet\nI really can name nothing out of the way. No, sir; I can make no hand\nof it; I can\u2019t describe him. And it\u2019s not want of memory; for I declare\nI can see him this moment.\u201d\n\nMr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a\nweight of consideration. \u201cYou are sure he used a key?\u201d he inquired at\nlast.\n\n\u201cMy dear sir...\u201d began Enfield, surprised out of himself.\n\n\u201cYes, I know,\u201d said Utterson; \u201cI know it must seem strange. The fact\nis, if I do not ask you the name of the other party, it is because I\nknow it already. You see, Richard, your tale has gone home. If you have\nbeen inexact in any point you had better correct it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you might have warned me,\u201d returned the other with a touch of\nsullenness. \u201cBut I have been pedantically exact, as you call it. The\nfellow had a key; and what\u2019s more, he has it still. I saw him use it\nnot a week ago.\u201d\n\nMr. Utterson sighed deeply but said never a word; and the young man\npresently resumed. \u201cHere is another lesson to say nothing,\u201d said he. \u201cI\nam ashamed of my long tongue. Let us make a bargain never to refer to\nthis again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith all my heart,\u201d said the lawyer. \u201cI shake hands on that, Richard.\u201d\n\n\n\nSEARCH FOR MR. HYDE\n\nThat evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre\nspirits and sat down to dinner without relish. It was his custom of a\nSunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume of\nsome dry divinity on his reading desk, until the clock of the\nneighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when he would go\nsoberly and gratefully to bed. On this night however, as soon as the\ncloth was taken away, he took up a candle and went into his business\nroom. There he opened his safe, took from the most private part of it a\ndocument endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekyll\u2019s Will and sat down\nwith a clouded brow to study its contents. The will was holograph, for\nMr. Utterson though he took charge of it now that it was made, had\nrefused to lend the least assistance in the making of it; it provided\nnot only that, in case of the decease of Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L.,\nL.L.D., F.R.S., etc., all his possessions were to pass into the hands\nof his \u201cfriend and benefactor Edward Hyde,\u201d but that in case of Dr.\nJekyll\u2019s \u201cdisappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding\nthree calendar months,\u201d the said Edward Hyde should step into the said\nHenry Jekyll\u2019s shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or\nobligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the\ndoctor\u2019s household. This document had long been the lawyer\u2019s eyesore.\nIt offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and\ncustomary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest. And\nhitherto it was his ignorance of Mr. Hyde that had swelled his\nindignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was his knowledge. It was\nalready bad enough when the name was but a name of which he could learn\nno more. It was worse when it began to be clothed upon with detestable\nattributes; and out of the shifting, insubstantial mists that had so\nlong baffled his eye, there leaped up the sudden, definite presentment\nof a fiend.\n\n\u201cI thought it was madness,\u201d he said, as he replaced the obnoxious paper\nin the safe, \u201cand now I begin to fear it is disgrace.\u201d\n\nWith that he blew out his candle, put on a greatcoat, and set forth in\nthe direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of medicine, where his\nfriend, the great Dr. Lanyon, had his house and received his crowding\npatients. \u201cIf anyone knows, it will be Lanyon,\u201d he had thought.\n\nThe solemn butler knew and welcomed him; he was subjected to no stage\nof delay, but ushered direct from the door to the dining-room where Dr.\nLanyon sat alone over his wine. This was a hearty, healthy, dapper,\nred-faced gentleman, with a shock of hair prematurely white, and a\nboisterous and decided manner. At sight of Mr. Utterson, he sprang up\nfrom his chair and welcomed him with both hands. The geniality, as was\nthe way of the man, was somewhat theatrical to the eye; but it reposed\non genuine feeling. For these two were old friends, old mates both at\nschool and college, both thorough respectors of themselves and of each\nother, and what does not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed each\nother\u2019s company.\n\nAfter a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject which so\ndisagreeably preoccupied his mind.\n\n\u201cI suppose, Lanyon,\u201d said he, \u201cyou and I must be the two oldest friends\nthat Henry Jekyll has?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish the friends were younger,\u201d chuckled Dr. Lanyon. \u201cBut I suppose\nwe are. And what of that? I see little of him now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed?\u201d said Utterson. \u201cI thought you had a bond of common interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had,\u201d was the reply. \u201cBut it is more than ten years since Henry\nJekyll became too fanciful for me. He began to go wrong, wrong in mind;\nand though of course I continue to take an interest in him for old\nsake\u2019s sake, as they say, I see and I have seen devilish little of the\nman. Such unscientific balderdash,\u201d added the doctor, flushing suddenly\npurple, \u201cwould have estranged Damon and Pythias.\u201d\n\nThis little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr. Utterson.\n\u201cThey have only differed on some point of science,\u201d he thought; and\nbeing a man of no scientific passions (except in the matter of\nconveyancing), he even added: \u201cIt is nothing worse than that!\u201d He gave\nhis friend a few seconds to recover his composure, and then approached\nthe question he had come to put. \u201cDid you ever come across a _prot\u00e9g\u00e9_\nof his\u2014one Hyde?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cHyde?\u201d repeated Lanyon. \u201cNo. Never heard of him. Since my time.\u201d\n\nThat was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back with\nhim to the great, dark bed on which he tossed to and fro, until the\nsmall hours of the morning began to grow large. It was a night of\nlittle ease to his toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness and besieged\nby questions.\n\nSix o\u2019clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently\nnear to Mr. Utterson\u2019s dwelling, and still he was digging at the\nproblem. Hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side alone;\nbut now his imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved; and as he\nlay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained\nroom, Mr. Enfield\u2019s tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted\npictures. He would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal\ncity; then of the figure of a man walking swiftly; then of a child\nrunning from the doctor\u2019s; and then these met, and that human\nJuggernaut trod the child down and passed on regardless of her screams.\nOr else he would see a room in a rich house, where his friend lay\nasleep, dreaming and smiling at his dreams; and then the door of that\nroom would be opened, the curtains of the bed plucked apart, the\nsleeper recalled, and lo! there would stand by his side a figure to\nwhom power was given, and even at that dead hour, he must rise and do\nits bidding. The figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer all\nnight; and if at any time he dozed over, it was but to see it glide\nmore stealthily through sleeping houses, or move the more swiftly and\nstill the more swiftly, even to dizziness, through wider labyrinths of\nlamplighted city, and at every street corner crush a child and leave\nher screaming. And still the figure had no face by which he might know\nit; even in his dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled him and\nmelted before his eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and grew\napace in the lawyer\u2019s mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate,\ncuriosity to behold the features of the real Mr. Hyde. If he could but\nonce set eyes on him, he thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps\nroll altogether away, as was the habit of mysterious things when well\nexamined. He might see a reason for his friend\u2019s strange preference or\nbondage (call it which you please) and even for the startling clause of\nthe will. At least it would be a face worth seeing: the face of a man\nwho was without bowels of mercy: a face which had but to show itself to\nraise up, in the mind of the unimpressionable Enfield, a spirit of\nenduring hatred.\n\nFrom that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in the\nby-street of shops. In the morning before office hours, at noon when\nbusiness was plenty and time scarce, at night under the face of the\nfogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or\nconcourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post.\n\n\u201cIf he be Mr. Hyde,\u201d he had thought, \u201cI shall be Mr. Seek.\u201d\n\nAnd at last his patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night; frost\nin the air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps,\nunshaken by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow. By\nten o\u2019clock, when the shops were closed, the by-street was very\nsolitary and, in spite of the low growl of London from all round, very\nsilent. Small sounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houses\nwere clearly audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of\nthe approach of any passenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Utterson\nhad been some minutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd light\nfootstep drawing near. In the course of his nightly patrols, he had\nlong grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of\na single person, while he is still a great way off, suddenly spring out\ndistinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city. Yet his attention\nhad never before been so sharply and decisively arrested; and it was\nwith a strong, superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into\nthe entry of the court.\n\nThe steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as they\nturned the end of the street. The lawyer, looking forth from the entry,\ncould soon see what manner of man he had to deal with. He was small and\nvery plainly dressed and the look of him, even at that distance, went\nsomehow strongly against the watcher\u2019s inclination. But he made\nstraight for the door, crossing the roadway to save time; and as he\ncame, he drew a key from his pocket like one approaching home.\n\nMr. Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed.\n\u201cMr. Hyde, I think?\u201d\n\nMr. Hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath. But his fear\nwas only momentary; and though he did not look the lawyer in the face,\nhe answered coolly enough: \u201cThat is my name. What do you want?\u201d\n\n\u201cI see you are going in,\u201d returned the lawyer. \u201cI am an old friend of\nDr. Jekyll\u2019s\u2014Mr. Utterson of Gaunt Street\u2014you must have heard of my\nname; and meeting you so conveniently, I thought you might admit me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will not find Dr. Jekyll; he is from home,\u201d replied Mr. Hyde,\nblowing in the key. And then suddenly, but still without looking up,\n\u201cHow did you know me?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cOn your side,\u201d said Mr. Utterson \u201cwill you do me a favour?\u201d\n\n\u201cWith pleasure,\u201d replied the other. \u201cWhat shall it be?\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you let me see your face?\u201d asked the lawyer.\n\nMr. Hyde appeared to hesitate, and then, as if upon some sudden\nreflection, fronted about with an air of defiance; and the pair stared\nat each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds. \u201cNow I shall know you\nagain,\u201d said Mr. Utterson. \u201cIt may be useful.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d returned Mr. Hyde, \u201cit is as well we have met; and _\u00e0 propos_,\nyou should have my address.\u201d And he gave a number of a street in Soho.\n\n\u201cGood God!\u201d thought Mr. Utterson, \u201ccan he, too, have been thinking of\nthe will?\u201d But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in\nacknowledgment of the address.\n\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d said the other, \u201chow did you know me?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy description,\u201d was the reply.\n\n\u201cWhose description?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have common friends,\u201d said Mr. Utterson.\n\n\u201cCommon friends,\u201d echoed Mr. Hyde, a little hoarsely. \u201cWho are they?\u201d\n\n\u201cJekyll, for instance,\u201d said the lawyer.\n\n\u201cHe never told you,\u201d cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger. \u201cI did not\nthink you would have lied.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome,\u201d said Mr. Utterson, \u201cthat is not fitting language.\u201d\n\nThe other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment, with\nextraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and disappeared into\nthe house.\n\nThe lawyer stood awhile when Mr. Hyde had left him, the picture of\ndisquietude. Then he began slowly to mount the street, pausing every\nstep or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in mental\nperplexity. The problem he was thus debating as he walked, was one of a\nclass that is rarely solved. Mr. Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave an\nimpression of deformity without any nameable malformation, he had a\ndispleasing smile, he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of\nmurderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and he spoke with a husky,\nwhispering and somewhat broken voice; all these were points against\nhim, but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown\ndisgust, loathing and fear with which Mr. Utterson regarded him. \u201cThere\nmust be something else,\u201d said the perplexed gentleman. \u201cThere _is_\nsomething more, if I could find a name for it. God bless me, the man\nseems hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall we say? or can it be\nthe old story of Dr. Fell? or is it the mere radiance of a foul soul\nthat thus transpires through, and transfigures, its clay continent? The\nlast, I think; for, O my poor old Harry Jekyll, if ever I read Satan\u2019s\nsignature upon a face, it is on that of your new friend.\u201d\n\nRound the corner from the by-street, there was a square of ancient,\nhandsome houses, now for the most part decayed from their high estate\nand let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men;\nmap-engravers, architects, shady lawyers and the agents of obscure\nenterprises. One house, however, second from the corner, was still\noccupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great air of\nwealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness except for\nthe fanlight, Mr. Utterson stopped and knocked. A well-dressed, elderly\nservant opened the door.\n\n\u201cIs Dr. Jekyll at home, Poole?\u201d asked the lawyer.\n\n\u201cI will see, Mr. Utterson,\u201d said Poole, admitting the visitor, as he\nspoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall paved with flags,\nwarmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright, open fire,\nand furnished with costly cabinets of oak. \u201cWill you wait here by the\nfire, sir? or shall I give you a light in the dining-room?\u201d\n\n\u201cHere, thank you,\u201d said the lawyer, and he drew near and leaned on the\ntall fender. This hall, in which he was now left alone, was a pet fancy\nof his friend the doctor\u2019s; and Utterson himself was wont to speak of\nit as the pleasantest room in London. But tonight there was a shudder\nin his blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his memory; he felt (what\nwas rare with him) a nausea and distaste of life; and in the gloom of\nhis spirits, he seemed to read a menace in the flickering of the\nfirelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the\nshadow on the roof. He was ashamed of his relief, when Poole presently\nreturned to announce that Dr. Jekyll was gone out.\n\n\u201cI saw Mr. Hyde go in by the old dissecting room, Poole,\u201d he said. \u201cIs\nthat right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home?\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite right, Mr. Utterson, sir,\u201d replied the servant. \u201cMr. Hyde has a\nkey.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man,\nPoole,\u201d resumed the other musingly.\n\n\u201cYes, sir, he does indeed,\u201d said Poole. \u201cWe have all orders to obey\nhim.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not think I ever met Mr. Hyde?\u201d asked Utterson.\n\n\u201cO, dear no, sir. He never _dines_ here,\u201d replied the butler. \u201cIndeed\nwe see very little of him on this side of the house; he mostly comes\nand goes by the laboratory.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, good-night, Poole.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood-night, Mr. Utterson.\u201d\n\nAnd the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart. \u201cPoor Harry\nJekyll,\u201d he thought, \u201cmy mind misgives me he is in deep waters! He was\nwild when he was young; a long while ago to be sure; but in the law of\nGod, there is no statute of limitations. Ay, it must be that; the ghost\nof some old sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment\ncoming, _pede claudo_, years after memory has forgotten and self-love\ncondoned the fault.\u201d And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded\nawhile on his own past, groping in all the corners of memory, lest by\nchance some Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to light\nthere. His past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls of\ntheir life with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust by\nthe many ill things he had done, and raised up again into a sober and\nfearful gratitude by the many he had come so near to doing yet avoided.\nAnd then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a spark of\nhope. \u201cThis Master Hyde, if he were studied,\u201d thought he, \u201cmust have\nsecrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of him; secrets compared\nto which poor Jekyll\u2019s worst would be like sunshine. Things cannot\ncontinue as they are. It turns me cold to think of this creature\nstealing like a thief to Harry\u2019s bedside; poor Harry, what a wakening!\nAnd the danger of it; for if this Hyde suspects the existence of the\nwill, he may grow impatient to inherit. Ay, I must put my shoulders to\nthe wheel\u2014if Jekyll will but let me,\u201d he added, \u201cif Jekyll will only\nlet me.\u201d For once more he saw before his mind\u2019s eye, as clear as\ntransparency, the strange clauses of the will.\n\n\n\nDR. JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASE\n\nA fortnight later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one of\nhis pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies, all intelligent,\nreputable men and all judges of good wine; and Mr. Utterson so\ncontrived that he remained behind after the others had departed. This\nwas no new arrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores of\ntimes. Where Utterson was liked, he was liked well. Hosts loved to\ndetain the dry lawyer, when the light-hearted and loose-tongued had\nalready their foot on the threshold; they liked to sit a while in his\nunobtrusive company, practising for solitude, sobering their minds in\nthe man\u2019s rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety. To this\nrule, Dr. Jekyll was no exception; and as he now sat on the opposite\nside of the fire\u2014a large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with\nsomething of a slyish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity and\nkindness\u2014you could see by his looks that he cherished for Mr. Utterson\na sincere and warm affection.\n\n\u201cI have been wanting to speak to you, Jekyll,\u201d began the latter. \u201cYou\nknow that will of yours?\u201d\n\nA close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful;\nbut the doctor carried it off gaily. \u201cMy poor Utterson,\u201d said he, \u201cyou\nare unfortunate in such a client. I never saw a man so distressed as\nyou were by my will; unless it were that hide-bound pedant, Lanyon, at\nwhat he called my scientific heresies. O, I know he\u2019s a good fellow\u2014you\nneedn\u2019t frown\u2014an excellent fellow, and I always mean to see more of\nhim; but a hide-bound pedant for all that; an ignorant, blatant pedant.\nI was never more disappointed in any man than Lanyon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know I never approved of it,\u201d pursued Utterson, ruthlessly\ndisregarding the fresh topic.\n\n\u201cMy will? Yes, certainly, I know that,\u201d said the doctor, a trifle\nsharply. \u201cYou have told me so.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I tell you so again,\u201d continued the lawyer. \u201cI have been\nlearning something of young Hyde.\u201d\n\nThe large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and\nthere came a blackness about his eyes. \u201cI do not care to hear more,\u201d\nsaid he. \u201cThis is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I heard was abominable,\u201d said Utterson.\n\n\u201cIt can make no change. You do not understand my position,\u201d returned\nthe doctor, with a certain incoherency of manner. \u201cI am painfully\nsituated, Utterson; my position is a very strange\u2014a very strange one.\nIt is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking.\u201d\n\n\u201cJekyll,\u201d said Utterson, \u201cyou know me: I am a man to be trusted. Make a\nclean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can get you\nout of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy good Utterson,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cthis is very good of you, this is\ndownright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you in. I\nbelieve you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, before\nmyself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isn\u2019t what you fancy;\nit is not as bad as that; and just to put your good heart at rest, I\nwill tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde.\nI give you my hand upon that; and I thank you again and again; and I\nwill just add one little word, Utterson, that I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll take in\ngood part: this is a private matter, and I beg of you to let it sleep.\u201d\n\nUtterson reflected a little, looking in the fire.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt you are perfectly right,\u201d he said at last, getting to\nhis feet.\n\n\u201cWell, but since we have touched upon this business, and for the last\ntime I hope,\u201d continued the doctor, \u201cthere is one point I should like\nyou to understand. I have really a very great interest in poor Hyde. I\nknow you have seen him; he told me so; and I fear he was rude. But I do\nsincerely take a great, a very great interest in that young man; and if\nI am taken away, Utterson, I wish you to promise me that you will bear\nwith him and get his rights for him. I think you would, if you knew\nall; and it would be a weight off my mind if you would promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t pretend that I shall ever like him,\u201d said the lawyer.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t ask that,\u201d pleaded Jekyll, laying his hand upon the other\u2019s\narm; \u201cI only ask for justice; I only ask you to help him for my sake,\nwhen I am no longer here.\u201d\n\nUtterson heaved an irrepressible sigh. \u201cWell,\u201d said he, \u201cI promise.\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE CAREW MURDER CASE\n\nNearly a year later, in the month of October, 18\u2014, London was startled\nby a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by\nthe high position of the victim. The details were few and startling. A\nmaid servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone\nupstairs to bed about eleven. Although a fog rolled over the city in\nthe small hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the\nlane, which the maid\u2019s window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by the\nfull moon. It seems she was romantically given, for she sat down upon\nher box, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into a\ndream of musing. Never (she used to say, with streaming tears, when she\nnarrated that experience), never had she felt more at peace with all\nmen or thought more kindly of the world. And as she so sat she became\naware of an aged beautiful gentleman with white hair, drawing near\nalong the lane; and advancing to meet him, another and very small\ngentleman, to whom at first she paid less attention. When they had come\nwithin speech (which was just under the maid\u2019s eyes) the older man\nbowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of politeness.\nIt did not seem as if the subject of his address were of great\nimportance; indeed, from his pointing, it sometimes appeared as if he\nwere only inquiring his way; but the moon shone on his face as he\nspoke, and the girl was pleased to watch it, it seemed to breathe such\nan innocent and old-world kindness of disposition, yet with something\nhigh too, as of a well-founded self-content. Presently her eye wandered\nto the other, and she was surprised to recognise in him a certain Mr.\nHyde, who had once visited her master and for whom she had conceived a\ndislike. He had in his hand a heavy cane, with which he was trifling;\nbut he answered never a word, and seemed to listen with an\nill-contained impatience. And then all of a sudden he broke out in a\ngreat flame of anger, stamping with his foot, brandishing the cane, and\ncarrying on (as the maid described it) like a madman. The old gentleman\ntook a step back, with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle\nhurt; and at that Mr. Hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed him to\nthe earth. And next moment, with ape-like fury, he was trampling his\nvictim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows, under which the\nbones were audibly shattered and the body jumped upon the roadway. At\nthe horror of these sights and sounds, the maid fainted.\n\nIt was two o\u2019clock when she came to herself and called for the police.\nThe murderer was gone long ago; but there lay his victim in the middle\nof the lane, incredibly mangled. The stick with which the deed had been\ndone, although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood, had\nbroken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty; and\none splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter\u2014the other,\nwithout doubt, had been carried away by the murderer. A purse and gold\nwatch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except a\nsealed and stamped envelope, which he had been probably carrying to the\npost, and which bore the name and address of Mr. Utterson.\n\nThis was brought to the lawyer the next morning, before he was out of\nbed; and he had no sooner seen it and been told the circumstances, than\nhe shot out a solemn lip. \u201cI shall say nothing till I have seen the\nbody,\u201d said he; \u201cthis may be very serious. Have the kindness to wait\nwhile I dress.\u201d And with the same grave countenance he hurried through\nhis breakfast and drove to the police station, whither the body had\nbeen carried. As soon as he came into the cell, he nodded.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said he, \u201cI recognise him. I am sorry to say that this is Sir\nDanvers Carew.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood God, sir,\u201d exclaimed the officer, \u201cis it possible?\u201d And the next\nmoment his eye lighted up with professional ambition. \u201cThis will make a\ndeal of noise,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd perhaps you can help us to the man.\u201d And\nhe briefly narrated what the maid had seen, and showed the broken\nstick.\n\nMr. Utterson had already quailed at the name of Hyde; but when the\nstick was laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken and\nbattered as it was, he recognised it for one that he had himself\npresented many years before to Henry Jekyll.\n\n\u201cIs this Mr. Hyde a person of small stature?\u201d he inquired.\n\n\u201cParticularly small and particularly wicked-looking, is what the maid\ncalls him,\u201d said the officer.\n\nMr. Utterson reflected; and then, raising his head, \u201cIf you will come\nwith me in my cab,\u201d he said, \u201cI think I can take you to his house.\u201d\n\nIt was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of the\nseason. A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but the\nwind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours; so\nthat as the cab crawled from street to street, Mr. Utterson beheld a\nmarvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight; for here it would be\ndark like the back-end of evening; and there would be a glow of a rich,\nlurid brown, like the light of some strange conflagration; and here,\nfor a moment, the fog would be quite broken up, and a haggard shaft of\ndaylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths. The dismal\nquarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses, with its muddy\nways, and slatternly passengers, and its lamps, which had never been\nextinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful\nreinvasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyer\u2019s eyes, like a district\nof some city in a nightmare. The thoughts of his mind, besides, were of\nthe gloomiest dye; and when he glanced at the companion of his drive,\nhe was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law\u2019s\nofficers, which may at times assail the most honest.\n\nAs the cab drew up before the address indicated, the fog lifted a\nlittle and showed him a dingy street, a gin palace, a low French eating\nhouse, a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads, many\nragged children huddled in the doorways, and many women of many\ndifferent nationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a morning\nglass; and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part,\nas brown as umber, and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings.\nThis was the home of Henry Jekyll\u2019s favourite; of a man who was heir to\na quarter of a million sterling.\n\nAn ivory-faced and silvery-haired old woman opened the door. She had an\nevil face, smoothed by hypocrisy: but her manners were excellent. Yes,\nshe said, this was Mr. Hyde\u2019s, but he was not at home; he had been in\nthat night very late, but he had gone away again in less than an hour;\nthere was nothing strange in that; his habits were very irregular, and\nhe was often absent; for instance, it was nearly two months since she\nhad seen him till yesterday.\n\n\u201cVery well, then, we wish to see his rooms,\u201d said the lawyer; and when\nthe woman began to declare it was impossible, \u201cI had better tell you\nwho this person is,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is Inspector Newcomen of Scotland\nYard.\u201d\n\nA flash of odious joy appeared upon the woman\u2019s face. \u201cAh!\u201d said she,\n\u201che is in trouble! What has he done?\u201d\n\nMr. Utterson and the inspector exchanged glances. \u201cHe don\u2019t seem a very\npopular character,\u201d observed the latter. \u201cAnd now, my good woman, just\nlet me and this gentleman have a look about us.\u201d\n\nIn the whole extent of the house, which but for the old woman remained\notherwise empty, Mr. Hyde had only used a couple of rooms; but these\nwere furnished with luxury and good taste. A closet was filled with\nwine; the plate was of silver, the napery elegant; a good picture hung\nupon the walls, a gift (as Utterson supposed) from Henry Jekyll, who\nwas much of a connoisseur; and the carpets were of many plies and\nagreeable in colour. At this moment, however, the rooms bore every mark\nof having been recently and hurriedly ransacked; clothes lay about the\nfloor, with their pockets inside out; lock-fast drawers stood open; and\non the hearth there lay a pile of grey ashes, as though many papers had\nbeen burned. From these embers the inspector disinterred the butt end\nof a green cheque book, which had resisted the action of the fire; the\nother half of the stick was found behind the door; and as this clinched\nhis suspicions, the officer declared himself delighted. A visit to the\nbank, where several thousand pounds were found to be lying to the\nmurderer\u2019s credit, completed his gratification.\n\n\u201cYou may depend upon it, sir,\u201d he told Mr. Utterson: \u201cI have him in my\nhand. He must have lost his head, or he never would have left the stick\nor, above all, burned the cheque book. Why, money\u2019s life to the man. We\nhave nothing to do but wait for him at the bank, and get out the\nhandbills.\u201d\n\nThis last, however, was not so easy of accomplishment; for Mr. Hyde had\nnumbered few familiars\u2014even the master of the servant maid had only\nseen him twice; his family could nowhere be traced; he had never been\nphotographed; and the few who could describe him differed widely, as\ncommon observers will. Only on one point were they agreed; and that was\nthe haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitive\nimpressed his beholders.\n\n\n\nINCIDENT OF THE LETTER\n\nIt was late in the afternoon, when Mr. Utterson found his way to Dr.\nJekyll\u2019s door, where he was at once admitted by Poole, and carried down\nby the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden,\nto the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or\ndissecting rooms. The doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a\ncelebrated surgeon; and his own tastes being rather chemical than\nanatomical, had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of\nthe garden. It was the first time that the lawyer had been received in\nthat part of his friend\u2019s quarters; and he eyed the dingy, windowless\nstructure with curiosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense of\nstrangeness as he crossed the theatre, once crowded with eager students\nand now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemical\napparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing\nstraw, and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola. At the\nfurther end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red\nbaize; and through this, Mr. Utterson was at last received into the\ndoctor\u2019s cabinet. It was a large room fitted round with glass presses,\nfurnished, among other things, with a cheval-glass and a business\ntable, and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred\nwith iron. The fire burned in the grate; a lamp was set lighted on the\nchimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly; and\nthere, close up to the warmth, sat Dr. Jekyll, looking deathly sick. He\ndid not rise to meet his visitor, but held out a cold hand and bade him\nwelcome in a changed voice.\n\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d said Mr. Utterson, as soon as Poole had left them, \u201cyou have\nheard the news?\u201d\n\nThe doctor shuddered. \u201cThey were crying it in the square,\u201d he said. \u201cI\nheard them in my dining-room.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne word,\u201d said the lawyer. \u201cCarew was my client, but so are you, and\nI want to know what I am doing. You have not been mad enough to hide\nthis fellow?\u201d\n\n\u201cUtterson, I swear to God,\u201d cried the doctor, \u201cI swear to God I will\nnever set eyes on him again. I bind my honour to you that I am done\nwith him in this world. It is all at an end. And indeed he does not\nwant my help; you do not know him as I do; he is safe, he is quite\nsafe; mark my words, he will never more be heard of.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer listened gloomily; he did not like his friend\u2019s feverish\nmanner. \u201cYou seem pretty sure of him,\u201d said he; \u201cand for your sake, I\nhope you may be right. If it came to a trial, your name might appear.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am quite sure of him,\u201d replied Jekyll; \u201cI have grounds for certainty\nthat I cannot share with any one. But there is one thing on which you\nmay advise me. I have\u2014I have received a letter; and I am at a loss\nwhether I should show it to the police. I should like to leave it in\nyour hands, Utterson; you would judge wisely, I am sure; I have so\ngreat a trust in you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou fear, I suppose, that it might lead to his detection?\u201d asked the\nlawyer.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the other. \u201cI cannot say that I care what becomes of Hyde; I\nam quite done with him. I was thinking of my own character, which this\nhateful business has rather exposed.\u201d\n\nUtterson ruminated awhile; he was surprised at his friend\u2019s\nselfishness, and yet relieved by it. \u201cWell,\u201d said he, at last, \u201clet me\nsee the letter.\u201d\n\nThe letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed \u201cEdward\nHyde\u201d: and it signified, briefly enough, that the writer\u2019s benefactor,\nDr. Jekyll, whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand\ngenerosities, need labour under no alarm for his safety, as he had\nmeans of escape on which he placed a sure dependence. The lawyer liked\nthis letter well enough; it put a better colour on the intimacy than he\nhad looked for; and he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions.\n\n\u201cHave you the envelope?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI burned it,\u201d replied Jekyll, \u201cbefore I thought what I was about. But\nit bore no postmark. The note was handed in.\u201d\n\n\u201cShall I keep this and sleep upon it?\u201d asked Utterson.\n\n\u201cI wish you to judge for me entirely,\u201d was the reply. \u201cI have lost\nconfidence in myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I shall consider,\u201d returned the lawyer. \u201cAnd now one word more:\nit was Hyde who dictated the terms in your will about that\ndisappearance?\u201d\n\nThe doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness; he shut his mouth\ntight and nodded.\n\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d said Utterson. \u201cHe meant to murder you. You had a fine\nescape.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have had what is far more to the purpose,\u201d returned the doctor\nsolemnly: \u201cI have had a lesson\u2014O God, Utterson, what a lesson I have\nhad!\u201d And he covered his face for a moment with his hands.\n\nOn his way out, the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with Poole.\n\u201cBy the bye,\u201d said he, \u201cthere was a letter handed in to-day: what was\nthe messenger like?\u201d But Poole was positive nothing had come except by\npost; \u201cand only circulars by that,\u201d he added.\n\nThis news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed. Plainly the\nletter had come by the laboratory door; possibly, indeed, it had been\nwritten in the cabinet; and if that were so, it must be differently\njudged, and handled with the more caution. The newsboys, as he went,\nwere crying themselves hoarse along the footways: \u201cSpecial edition.\nShocking murder of an M.P.\u201d That was the funeral oration of one friend\nand client; and he could not help a certain apprehension lest the good\nname of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal. It\nwas, at least, a ticklish decision that he had to make; and\nself-reliant as he was by habit, he began to cherish a longing for\nadvice. It was not to be had directly; but perhaps, he thought, it\nmight be fished for.\n\nPresently after, he sat on one side of his own hearth, with Mr. Guest,\nhis head clerk, upon the other, and midway between, at a nicely\ncalculated distance from the fire, a bottle of a particular old wine\nthat had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of his house. The fog\nstill slept on the wing above the drowned city, where the lamps\nglimmered like carbuncles; and through the muffle and smother of these\nfallen clouds, the procession of the town\u2019s life was still rolling in\nthrough the great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind. But the\nroom was gay with firelight. In the bottle the acids were long ago\nresolved; the imperial dye had softened with time, as the colour grows\nricher in stained windows; and the glow of hot autumn afternoons on\nhillside vineyards, was ready to be set free and to disperse the fogs\nof London. Insensibly the lawyer melted. There was no man from whom he\nkept fewer secrets than Mr. Guest; and he was not always sure that he\nkept as many as he meant. Guest had often been on business to the\ndoctor\u2019s; he knew Poole; he could scarce have failed to hear of Mr.\nHyde\u2019s familiarity about the house; he might draw conclusions: was it\nnot as well, then, that he should see a letter which put that mystery\nto right? and above all since Guest, being a great student and critic\nof handwriting, would consider the step natural and obliging? The\nclerk, besides, was a man of counsel; he could scarce read so strange a\ndocument without dropping a remark; and by that remark Mr. Utterson\nmight shape his future course.\n\n\u201cThis is a sad business about Sir Danvers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYes, sir, indeed. It has elicited a great deal of public feeling,\u201d\nreturned Guest. \u201cThe man, of course, was mad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should like to hear your views on that,\u201d replied Utterson. \u201cI have a\ndocument here in his handwriting; it is between ourselves, for I scarce\nknow what to do about it; it is an ugly business at the best. But there\nit is; quite in your way: a murderer\u2019s autograph.\u201d\n\nGuest\u2019s eyes brightened, and he sat down at once and studied it with\npassion. \u201cNo sir,\u201d he said: \u201cnot mad; but it is an odd hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd by all accounts a very odd writer,\u201d added the lawyer.\n\nJust then the servant entered with a note.\n\n\u201cIs that from Dr. Jekyll, sir?\u201d inquired the clerk. \u201cI thought I knew\nthe writing. Anything private, Mr. Utterson?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly an invitation to dinner. Why? Do you want to see it?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne moment. I thank you, sir;\u201d and the clerk laid the two sheets of\npaper alongside and sedulously compared their contents. \u201cThank you,\nsir,\u201d he said at last, returning both; \u201cit\u2019s a very interesting\nautograph.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause, during which Mr. Utterson struggled with himself.\n\u201cWhy did you compare them, Guest?\u201d he inquired suddenly.\n\n\u201cWell, sir,\u201d returned the clerk, \u201cthere\u2019s a rather singular\nresemblance; the two hands are in many points identical: only\ndifferently sloped.\u201d\n\n\u201cRather quaint,\u201d said Utterson.\n\n\u201cIt is, as you say, rather quaint,\u201d returned Guest.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t speak of this note, you know,\u201d said the master.\n\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d said the clerk. \u201cI understand.\u201d\n\nBut no sooner was Mr. Utterson alone that night, than he locked the\nnote into his safe, where it reposed from that time forward. \u201cWhat!\u201d he\nthought. \u201cHenry Jekyll forge for a murderer!\u201d And his blood ran cold in\nhis veins.\n\n\n\nINCIDENT OF DR. LANYON\n\nTime ran on; thousands of pounds were offered in reward, for the death\nof Sir Danvers was resented as a public injury; but Mr. Hyde had\ndisappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had never\nexisted. Much of his past was unearthed, indeed, and all disreputable:\ntales came out of the man\u2019s cruelty, at once so callous and violent; of\nhis vile life, of his strange associates, of the hatred that seemed to\nhave surrounded his career; but of his present whereabouts, not a\nwhisper. From the time he had left the house in Soho on the morning of\nthe murder, he was simply blotted out; and gradually, as time drew on,\nMr. Utterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm, and to\ngrow more at quiet with himself. The death of Sir Danvers was, to his\nway of thinking, more than paid for by the disappearance of Mr. Hyde.\nNow that that evil influence had been withdrawn, a new life began for\nDr. Jekyll. He came out of his seclusion, renewed relations with his\nfriends, became once more their familiar guest and entertainer; and\nwhilst he had always been known for charities, he was now no less\ndistinguished for religion. He was busy, he was much in the open air,\nhe did good; his face seemed to open and brighten, as if with an inward\nconsciousness of service; and for more than two months, the doctor was\nat peace.\n\nOn the 8th of January Utterson had dined at the doctor\u2019s with a small\nparty; Lanyon had been there; and the face of the host had looked from\none to the other as in the old days when the trio were inseparable\nfriends. On the 12th, and again on the 14th, the door was shut against\nthe lawyer. \u201cThe doctor was confined to the house,\u201d Poole said, \u201cand\nsaw no one.\u201d On the 15th, he tried again, and was again refused; and\nhaving now been used for the last two months to see his friend almost\ndaily, he found this return of solitude to weigh upon his spirits. The\nfifth night he had in Guest to dine with him; and the sixth he betook\nhimself to Dr. Lanyon\u2019s.\n\nThere at least he was not denied admittance; but when he came in, he\nwas shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctor\u2019s\nappearance. He had his death-warrant written legibly upon his face. The\nrosy man had grown pale; his flesh had fallen away; he was visibly\nbalder and older; and yet it was not so much these tokens of a swift\nphysical decay that arrested the lawyer\u2019s notice, as a look in the eye\nand quality of manner that seemed to testify to some deep-seated terror\nof the mind. It was unlikely that the doctor should fear death; and yet\nthat was what Utterson was tempted to suspect. \u201cYes,\u201d he thought; \u201che\nis a doctor, he must know his own state and that his days are counted;\nand the knowledge is more than he can bear.\u201d And yet when Utterson\nremarked on his ill looks, it was with an air of great firmness that\nLanyon declared himself a doomed man.\n\n\u201cI have had a shock,\u201d he said, \u201cand I shall never recover. It is a\nquestion of weeks. Well, life has been pleasant; I liked it; yes, sir,\nI used to like it. I sometimes think if we knew all, we should be more\nglad to get away.\u201d\n\n\u201cJekyll is ill, too,\u201d observed Utterson. \u201cHave you seen him?\u201d\n\nBut Lanyon\u2019s face changed, and he held up a trembling hand. \u201cI wish to\nsee or hear no more of Dr. Jekyll,\u201d he said in a loud, unsteady voice.\n\u201cI am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will spare me any\nallusion to one whom I regard as dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cTut, tut!\u201d said Mr. Utterson; and then after a considerable pause,\n\u201cCan\u2019t I do anything?\u201d he inquired. \u201cWe are three very old friends,\nLanyon; we shall not live to make others.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing can be done,\u201d returned Lanyon; \u201cask himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will not see me,\u201d said the lawyer.\n\n\u201cI am not surprised at that,\u201d was the reply. \u201cSome day, Utterson, after\nI am dead, you may perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this. I\ncannot tell you. And in the meantime, if you can sit and talk with me\nof other things, for God\u2019s sake, stay and do so; but if you cannot keep\nclear of this accursed topic, then in God\u2019s name, go, for I cannot bear\nit.\u201d\n\nAs soon as he got home, Utterson sat down and wrote to Jekyll,\ncomplaining of his exclusion from the house, and asking the cause of\nthis unhappy break with Lanyon; and the next day brought him a long\nanswer, often very pathetically worded, and sometimes darkly mysterious\nin drift. The quarrel with Lanyon was incurable. \u201cI do not blame our\nold friend,\u201d Jekyll wrote, \u201cbut I share his view that we must never\nmeet. I mean from henceforth to lead a life of extreme seclusion; you\nmust not be surprised, nor must you doubt my friendship, if my door is\noften shut even to you. You must suffer me to go my own dark way. I\nhave brought on myself a punishment and a danger that I cannot name. If\nI am the chief of sinners, I am the chief of sufferers also. I could\nnot think that this earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors\nso unmanning; and you can do but one thing, Utterson, to lighten this\ndestiny, and that is to respect my silence.\u201d Utterson was amazed; the\ndark influence of Hyde had been withdrawn, the doctor had returned to\nhis old tasks and amities; a week ago, the prospect had smiled with\nevery promise of a cheerful and an honoured age; and now in a moment,\nfriendship, and peace of mind, and the whole tenor of his life were\nwrecked. So great and unprepared a change pointed to madness; but in\nview of Lanyon\u2019s manner and words, there must lie for it some deeper\nground.\n\nA week afterwards Dr. Lanyon took to his bed, and in something less\nthan a fortnight he was dead. The night after the funeral, at which he\nhad been sadly affected, Utterson locked the door of his business room,\nand sitting there by the light of a melancholy candle, drew out and set\nbefore him an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with the seal\nof his dead friend. \u201cPRIVATE: for the hands of G. J. Utterson ALONE,\nand in case of his predecease _to be destroyed unread_,\u201d so it was\nemphatically superscribed; and the lawyer dreaded to behold the\ncontents. \u201cI have buried one friend to-day,\u201d he thought: \u201cwhat if this\nshould cost me another?\u201d And then he condemned the fear as a\ndisloyalty, and broke the seal. Within there was another enclosure,\nlikewise sealed, and marked upon the cover as \u201cnot to be opened till\nthe death or disappearance of Dr. Henry Jekyll.\u201d Utterson could not\ntrust his eyes. Yes, it was disappearance; here again, as in the mad\nwill which he had long ago restored to its author, here again were the\nidea of a disappearance and the name of Henry Jekyll bracketted. But in\nthe will, that idea had sprung from the sinister suggestion of the man\nHyde; it was set there with a purpose all too plain and horrible.\nWritten by the hand of Lanyon, what should it mean? A great curiosity\ncame on the trustee, to disregard the prohibition and dive at once to\nthe bottom of these mysteries; but professional honour and faith to his\ndead friend were stringent obligations; and the packet slept in the\ninmost corner of his private safe.\n\nIt is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and it may\nbe doubted if, from that day forth, Utterson desired the society of his\nsurviving friend with the same eagerness. He thought of him kindly; but\nhis thoughts were disquieted and fearful. He went to call indeed; but\nhe was perhaps relieved to be denied admittance; perhaps, in his heart,\nhe preferred to speak with Poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by\nthe air and sounds of the open city, rather than to be admitted into\nthat house of voluntary bondage, and to sit and speak with its\ninscrutable recluse. Poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news to\ncommunicate. The doctor, it appeared, now more than ever confined\nhimself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he would sometimes\neven sleep; he was out of spirits, he had grown very silent, he did not\nread; it seemed as if he had something on his mind. Utterson became so\nused to the unvarying character of these reports, that he fell off\nlittle by little in the frequency of his visits.\n\n\n\nINCIDENT AT THE WINDOW\n\nIt chanced on Sunday, when Mr. Utterson was on his usual walk with Mr.\nEnfield, that their way lay once again through the by-street; and that\nwhen they came in front of the door, both stopped to gaze on it.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Enfield, \u201cthat story\u2019s at an end at least. We shall never\nsee more of Mr. Hyde.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope not,\u201d said Utterson. \u201cDid I ever tell you that I once saw him,\nand shared your feeling of repulsion?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was impossible to do the one without the other,\u201d returned Enfield.\n\u201cAnd by the way, what an ass you must have thought me, not to know that\nthis was a back way to Dr. Jekyll\u2019s! It was partly your own fault that\nI found it out, even when I did.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you found it out, did you?\u201d said Utterson. \u201cBut if that be so, we\nmay step into the court and take a look at the windows. To tell you the\ntruth, I am uneasy about poor Jekyll; and even outside, I feel as if\nthe presence of a friend might do him good.\u201d\n\nThe court was very cool and a little damp, and full of premature\ntwilight, although the sky, high up overhead, was still bright with\nsunset. The middle one of the three windows was half-way open; and\nsitting close beside it, taking the air with an infinite sadness of\nmien, like some disconsolate prisoner, Utterson saw Dr. Jekyll.\n\n\u201cWhat! Jekyll!\u201d he cried. \u201cI trust you are better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very low, Utterson,\u201d replied the doctor drearily, \u201cvery low. It\nwill not last long, thank God.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou stay too much indoors,\u201d said the lawyer. \u201cYou should be out,\nwhipping up the circulation like Mr. Enfield and me. (This is my\ncousin\u2014Mr. Enfield\u2014Dr. Jekyll.) Come now; get your hat and take a quick\nturn with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are very good,\u201d sighed the other. \u201cI should like to very much; but\nno, no, no, it is quite impossible; I dare not. But indeed, Utterson, I\nam very glad to see you; this is really a great pleasure; I would ask\nyou and Mr. Enfield up, but the place is really not fit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, then,\u201d said the lawyer, good-naturedly, \u201cthe best thing we can do\nis to stay down here and speak with you from where we are.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is just what I was about to venture to propose,\u201d returned the\ndoctor with a smile. But the words were hardly uttered, before the\nsmile was struck out of his face and succeeded by an expression of such\nabject terror and despair, as froze the very blood of the two gentlemen\nbelow. They saw it but for a glimpse for the window was instantly\nthrust down; but that glimpse had been sufficient, and they turned and\nleft the court without a word. In silence, too, they traversed the\nby-street; and it was not until they had come into a neighbouring\nthoroughfare, where even upon a Sunday there were still some stirrings\nof life, that Mr. Utterson at last turned and looked at his companion.\nThey were both pale; and there was an answering horror in their eyes.\n\n\u201cGod forgive us, God forgive us,\u201d said Mr. Utterson.\n\nBut Mr. Enfield only nodded his head very seriously, and walked on once\nmore in silence.\n\n\n\nTHE LAST NIGHT\n\nMr. Utterson was sitting by his fireside one evening after dinner, when\nhe was surprised to receive a visit from Poole.\n\n\u201cBless me, Poole, what brings you here?\u201d he cried; and then taking a\nsecond look at him, \u201cWhat ails you?\u201d he added; \u201cis the doctor ill?\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Utterson,\u201d said the man, \u201cthere is something wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you,\u201d said the lawyer.\n\u201cNow, take your time, and tell me plainly what you want.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know the doctor\u2019s ways, sir,\u201d replied Poole, \u201cand how he shuts\nhimself up. Well, he\u2019s shut up again in the cabinet; and I don\u2019t like\nit, sir\u2014I wish I may die if I like it. Mr. Utterson, sir, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, my good man,\u201d said the lawyer, \u201cbe explicit. What are you afraid\nof?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been afraid for about a week,\u201d returned Poole, doggedly\ndisregarding the question, \u201cand I can bear it no more.\u201d\n\nThe man\u2019s appearance amply bore out his words; his manner was altered\nfor the worse; and except for the moment when he had first announced\nhis terror, he had not once looked the lawyer in the face. Even now, he\nsat with the glass of wine untasted on his knee, and his eyes directed\nto a corner of the floor. \u201cI can bear it no more,\u201d he repeated.\n\n\u201cCome,\u201d said the lawyer, \u201cI see you have some good reason, Poole; I see\nthere is something seriously amiss. Try to tell me what it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s been foul play,\u201d said Poole, hoarsely.\n\n\u201cFoul play!\u201d cried the lawyer, a good deal frightened and rather\ninclined to be irritated in consequence. \u201cWhat foul play! What does the\nman mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cI daren\u2019t say, sir,\u201d was the answer; \u201cbut will you come along with me\nand see for yourself?\u201d\n\nMr. Utterson\u2019s only answer was to rise and get his hat and greatcoat;\nbut he observed with wonder the greatness of the relief that appeared\nupon the butler\u2019s face, and perhaps with no less, that the wine was\nstill untasted when he set it down to follow.\n\nIt was a wild, cold, seasonable night of March, with a pale moon, lying\non her back as though the wind had tilted her, and flying wrack of the\nmost diaphanous and lawny texture. The wind made talking difficult, and\nflecked the blood into the face. It seemed to have swept the streets\nunusually bare of passengers, besides; for Mr. Utterson thought he had\nnever seen that part of London so deserted. He could have wished it\notherwise; never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a wish\nto see and touch his fellow-creatures; for struggle as he might, there\nwas borne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity. The\nsquare, when they got there, was full of wind and dust, and the thin\ntrees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railing. Poole,\nwho had kept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled up in the\nmiddle of the pavement, and in spite of the biting weather, took off\nhis hat and mopped his brow with a red pocket-handkerchief. But for all\nthe hurry of his coming, these were not the dews of exertion that he\nwiped away, but the moisture of some strangling anguish; for his face\nwas white and his voice, when he spoke, harsh and broken.\n\n\u201cWell, sir,\u201d he said, \u201chere we are, and God grant there be nothing\nwrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmen, Poole,\u201d said the lawyer.\n\nThereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner; the door was\nopened on the chain; and a voice asked from within, \u201cIs that you,\nPoole?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d said Poole. \u201cOpen the door.\u201d\n\nThe hall, when they entered it, was brightly lighted up; the fire was\nbuilt high; and about the hearth the whole of the servants, men and\nwomen, stood huddled together like a flock of sheep. At the sight of\nMr. Utterson, the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering; and the\ncook, crying out \u201cBless God! it\u2019s Mr. Utterson,\u201d ran forward as if to\ntake him in her arms.\n\n\u201cWhat, what? Are you all here?\u201d said the lawyer peevishly. \u201cVery\nirregular, very unseemly; your master would be far from pleased.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all afraid,\u201d said Poole.\n\nBlank silence followed, no one protesting; only the maid lifted her\nvoice and now wept loudly.\n\n\u201cHold your tongue!\u201d Poole said to her, with a ferocity of accent that\ntestified to his own jangled nerves; and indeed, when the girl had so\nsuddenly raised the note of her lamentation, they had all started and\nturned towards the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation. \u201cAnd\nnow,\u201d continued the butler, addressing the knife-boy, \u201creach me a\ncandle, and we\u2019ll get this through hands at once.\u201d And then he begged\nMr. Utterson to follow him, and led the way to the back garden.\n\n\u201cNow, sir,\u201d said he, \u201cyou come as gently as you can. I want you to\nhear, and I don\u2019t want you to be heard. And see here, sir, if by any\nchance he was to ask you in, don\u2019t go.\u201d\n\nMr. Utterson\u2019s nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a jerk\nthat nearly threw him from his balance; but he recollected his courage\nand followed the butler into the laboratory building through the\nsurgical theatre, with its lumber of crates and bottles, to the foot of\nthe stair. Here Poole motioned him to stand on one side and listen;\nwhile he himself, setting down the candle and making a great and\nobvious call on his resolution, mounted the steps and knocked with a\nsomewhat uncertain hand on the red baize of the cabinet door.\n\n\u201cMr. Utterson, sir, asking to see you,\u201d he called; and even as he did\nso, once more violently signed to the lawyer to give ear.\n\nA voice answered from within: \u201cTell him I cannot see anyone,\u201d it said\ncomplainingly.\n\n\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d said Poole, with a note of something like triumph in\nhis voice; and taking up his candle, he led Mr. Utterson back across\nthe yard and into the great kitchen, where the fire was out and the\nbeetles were leaping on the floor.\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d he said, looking Mr. Utterson in the eyes, \u201cWas that my master\u2019s\nvoice?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems much changed,\u201d replied the lawyer, very pale, but giving look\nfor look.\n\n\u201cChanged? Well, yes, I think so,\u201d said the butler. \u201cHave I been twenty\nyears in this man\u2019s house, to be deceived about his voice? No, sir;\nmaster\u2019s made away with; he was made away with eight days ago, when we\nheard him cry out upon the name of God; and _who\u2019s_ in there instead of\nhim, and _why_ it stays there, is a thing that cries to Heaven, Mr.\nUtterson!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a very strange tale, Poole; this is rather a wild tale my\nman,\u201d said Mr. Utterson, biting his finger. \u201cSuppose it were as you\nsuppose, supposing Dr. Jekyll to have been\u2014well, murdered, what could\ninduce the murderer to stay? That won\u2019t hold water; it doesn\u2019t commend\nitself to reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Mr. Utterson, you are a hard man to satisfy, but I\u2019ll do it\nyet,\u201d said Poole. \u201cAll this last week (you must know) him, or it,\nwhatever it is that lives in that cabinet, has been crying night and\nday for some sort of medicine and cannot get it to his mind. It was\nsometimes his way\u2014the master\u2019s, that is\u2014to write his orders on a sheet\nof paper and throw it on the stair. We\u2019ve had nothing else this week\nback; nothing but papers, and a closed door, and the very meals left\nthere to be smuggled in when nobody was looking. Well, sir, every day,\nay, and twice and thrice in the same day, there have been orders and\ncomplaints, and I have been sent flying to all the wholesale chemists\nin town. Every time I brought the stuff back, there would be another\npaper telling me to return it, because it was not pure, and another\norder to a different firm. This drug is wanted bitter bad, sir,\nwhatever for.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you any of these papers?\u201d asked Mr. Utterson.\n\nPoole felt in his pocket and handed out a crumpled note, which the\nlawyer, bending nearer to the candle, carefully examined. Its contents\nran thus: \u201cDr. Jekyll presents his compliments to Messrs. Maw. He\nassures them that their last sample is impure and quite useless for his\npresent purpose. In the year 18\u2014, Dr. J. purchased a somewhat large\nquantity from Messrs. M. He now begs them to search with most sedulous\ncare, and should any of the same quality be left, forward it to him at\nonce. Expense is no consideration. The importance of this to Dr. J. can\nhardly be exaggerated.\u201d So far the letter had run composedly enough,\nbut here with a sudden splutter of the pen, the writer\u2019s emotion had\nbroken loose. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake,\u201d he added, \u201cfind me some of the old.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a strange note,\u201d said Mr. Utterson; and then sharply, \u201cHow do\nyou come to have it open?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe man at Maw\u2019s was main angry, sir, and he threw it back to me like\nso much dirt,\u201d returned Poole.\n\n\u201cThis is unquestionably the doctor\u2019s hand, do you know?\u201d resumed the\nlawyer.\n\n\u201cI thought it looked like it,\u201d said the servant rather sulkily; and\nthen, with another voice, \u201cBut what matters hand of write?\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen him!\u201d\n\n\u201cSeen him?\u201d repeated Mr. Utterson. \u201cWell?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d said Poole. \u201cIt was this way. I came suddenly into the\ntheatre from the garden. It seems he had slipped out to look for this\ndrug or whatever it is; for the cabinet door was open, and there he was\nat the far end of the room digging among the crates. He looked up when\nI came in, gave a kind of cry, and whipped upstairs into the cabinet.\nIt was but for one minute that I saw him, but the hair stood upon my\nhead like quills. Sir, if that was my master, why had he a mask upon\nhis face? If it was my master, why did he cry out like a rat, and run\nfrom me? I have served him long enough. And then...\u201d The man paused and\npassed his hand over his face.\n\n\u201cThese are all very strange circumstances,\u201d said Mr. Utterson, \u201cbut I\nthink I begin to see daylight. Your master, Poole, is plainly seized\nwith one of those maladies that both torture and deform the sufferer;\nhence, for aught I know, the alteration of his voice; hence the mask\nand the avoidance of his friends; hence his eagerness to find this\ndrug, by means of which the poor soul retains some hope of ultimate\nrecovery\u2014God grant that he be not deceived! There is my explanation; it\nis sad enough, Poole, ay, and appalling to consider; but it is plain\nand natural, hangs well together, and delivers us from all exorbitant\nalarms.\u201d\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d said the butler, turning to a sort of mottled pallor, \u201cthat\nthing was not my master, and there\u2019s the truth. My master\u201d\u2014here he\nlooked round him and began to whisper\u2014\u201cis a tall, fine build of a man,\nand this was more of a dwarf.\u201d Utterson attempted to protest. \u201cO, sir,\u201d\ncried Poole, \u201cdo you think I do not know my master after twenty years?\nDo you think I do not know where his head comes to in the cabinet door,\nwhere I saw him every morning of my life? No, sir, that thing in the\nmask was never Dr. Jekyll\u2014God knows what it was, but it was never Dr.\nJekyll; and it is the belief of my heart that there was murder done.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoole,\u201d replied the lawyer, \u201cif you say that, it will become my duty\nto make certain. Much as I desire to spare your master\u2019s feelings, much\nas I am puzzled by this note which seems to prove him to be still\nalive, I shall consider it my duty to break in that door.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, Mr. Utterson, that\u2019s talking!\u201d cried the butler.\n\n\u201cAnd now comes the second question,\u201d resumed Utterson: \u201cWho is going to\ndo it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, you and me, sir,\u201d was the undaunted reply.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very well said,\u201d returned the lawyer; \u201cand whatever comes of\nit, I shall make it my business to see you are no loser.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is an axe in the theatre,\u201d continued Poole; \u201cand you might take\nthe kitchen poker for yourself.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer took that rude but weighty instrument into his hand, and\nbalanced it. \u201cDo you know, Poole,\u201d he said, looking up, \u201cthat you and I\nare about to place ourselves in a position of some peril?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may say so, sir, indeed,\u201d returned the butler.\n\n\u201cIt is well, then that we should be frank,\u201d said the other. \u201cWe both\nthink more than we have said; let us make a clean breast. This masked\nfigure that you saw, did you recognise it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, sir, it went so quick, and the creature was so doubled up, that\nI could hardly swear to that,\u201d was the answer. \u201cBut if you mean, was it\nMr. Hyde?\u2014why, yes, I think it was! You see, it was much of the same\nbigness; and it had the same quick, light way with it; and then who\nelse could have got in by the laboratory door? You have not forgot,\nsir, that at the time of the murder he had still the key with him? But\nthat\u2019s not all. I don\u2019t know, Mr. Utterson, if you ever met this Mr.\nHyde?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the lawyer, \u201cI once spoke with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you must know as well as the rest of us that there was something\nqueer about that gentleman\u2014something that gave a man a turn\u2014I don\u2019t\nknow rightly how to say it, sir, beyond this: that you felt in your\nmarrow kind of cold and thin.\u201d\n\n\u201cI own I felt something of what you describe,\u201d said Mr. Utterson.\n\n\u201cQuite so, sir,\u201d returned Poole. \u201cWell, when that masked thing like a\nmonkey jumped from among the chemicals and whipped into the cabinet, it\nwent down my spine like ice. O, I know it\u2019s not evidence, Mr. Utterson;\nI\u2019m book-learned enough for that; but a man has his feelings, and I\ngive you my bible-word it was Mr. Hyde!\u201d\n\n\u201cAy, ay,\u201d said the lawyer. \u201cMy fears incline to the same point. Evil, I\nfear, founded\u2014evil was sure to come\u2014of that connection. Ay truly, I\nbelieve you; I believe poor Harry is killed; and I believe his murderer\n(for what purpose, God alone can tell) is still lurking in his victim\u2019s\nroom. Well, let our name be vengeance. Call Bradshaw.\u201d\n\nThe footman came at the summons, very white and nervous.\n\n\u201cPull yourself together, Bradshaw,\u201d said the lawyer. \u201cThis suspense, I\nknow, is telling upon all of you; but it is now our intention to make\nan end of it. Poole, here, and I are going to force our way into the\ncabinet. If all is well, my shoulders are broad enough to bear the\nblame. Meanwhile, lest anything should really be amiss, or any\nmalefactor seek to escape by the back, you and the boy must go round\nthe corner with a pair of good sticks and take your post at the\nlaboratory door. We give you ten minutes to get to your stations.\u201d\n\nAs Bradshaw left, the lawyer looked at his watch. \u201cAnd now, Poole, let\nus get to ours,\u201d he said; and taking the poker under his arm, led the\nway into the yard. The scud had banked over the moon, and it was now\nquite dark. The wind, which only broke in puffs and draughts into that\ndeep well of building, tossed the light of the candle to and fro about\ntheir steps, until they came into the shelter of the theatre, where\nthey sat down silently to wait. London hummed solemnly all around; but\nnearer at hand, the stillness was only broken by the sounds of a\nfootfall moving to and fro along the cabinet floor.\n\n\u201cSo it will walk all day, sir,\u201d whispered Poole; \u201cay, and the better\npart of the night. Only when a new sample comes from the chemist,\nthere\u2019s a bit of a break. Ah, it\u2019s an ill conscience that\u2019s such an\nenemy to rest! Ah, sir, there\u2019s blood foully shed in every step of it!\nBut hark again, a little closer\u2014put your heart in your ears, Mr.\nUtterson, and tell me, is that the doctor\u2019s foot?\u201d\n\nThe steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all they\nwent so slowly; it was different indeed from the heavy creaking tread\nof Henry Jekyll. Utterson sighed. \u201cIs there never anything else?\u201d he\nasked.\n\nPoole nodded. \u201cOnce,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce I heard it weeping!\u201d\n\n\u201cWeeping? how that?\u201d said the lawyer, conscious of a sudden chill of\nhorror.\n\n\u201cWeeping like a woman or a lost soul,\u201d said the butler. \u201cI came away\nwith that upon my heart, that I could have wept too.\u201d\n\nBut now the ten minutes drew to an end. Poole disinterred the axe from\nunder a stack of packing straw; the candle was set upon the nearest\ntable to light them to the attack; and they drew near with bated breath\nto where that patient foot was still going up and down, up and down, in\nthe quiet of the night.\n\n\u201cJekyll,\u201d cried Utterson, with a loud voice, \u201cI demand to see you.\u201d He\npaused a moment, but there came no reply. \u201cI give you fair warning, our\nsuspicions are aroused, and I must and shall see you,\u201d he resumed; \u201cif\nnot by fair means, then by foul\u2014if not of your consent, then by brute\nforce!\u201d\n\n\u201cUtterson,\u201d said the voice, \u201cfor God\u2019s sake, have mercy!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s not Jekyll\u2019s voice\u2014it\u2019s Hyde\u2019s!\u201d cried Utterson. \u201cDown with\nthe door, Poole!\u201d\n\nPoole swung the axe over his shoulder; the blow shook the building, and\nthe red baize door leaped against the lock and hinges. A dismal\nscreech, as of mere animal terror, rang from the cabinet. Up went the\naxe again, and again the panels crashed and the frame bounded; four\ntimes the blow fell; but the wood was tough and the fittings were of\nexcellent workmanship; and it was not until the fifth, that the lock\nburst and the wreck of the door fell inwards on the carpet.\n\nThe besiegers, appalled by their own riot and the stillness that had\nsucceeded, stood back a little and peered in. There lay the cabinet\nbefore their eyes in the quiet lamplight, a good fire glowing and\nchattering on the hearth, the kettle singing its thin strain, a drawer\nor two open, papers neatly set forth on the business table, and nearer\nthe fire, the things laid out for tea; the quietest room, you would\nhave said, and, but for the glazed presses full of chemicals, the most\ncommonplace that night in London.\n\nRight in the middle there lay the body of a man sorely contorted and\nstill twitching. They drew near on tiptoe, turned it on its back and\nbeheld the face of Edward Hyde. He was dressed in clothes far too large\nfor him, clothes of the doctor\u2019s bigness; the cords of his face still\nmoved with a semblance of life, but life was quite gone; and by the\ncrushed phial in the hand and the strong smell of kernels that hung\nupon the air, Utterson knew that he was looking on the body of a\nself-destroyer.\n\n\u201cWe have come too late,\u201d he said sternly, \u201cwhether to save or punish.\nHyde is gone to his account; and it only remains for us to find the\nbody of your master.\u201d\n\nThe far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the theatre,\nwhich filled almost the whole ground storey and was lighted from above,\nand by the cabinet, which formed an upper storey at one end and looked\nupon the court. A corridor joined the theatre to the door on the\nby-street; and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a\nsecond flight of stairs. There were besides a few dark closets and a\nspacious cellar. All these they now thoroughly examined. Each closet\nneeded but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fell\nfrom their doors, had stood long unopened. The cellar, indeed, was\nfilled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeon\nwho was Jekyll\u2019s predecessor; but even as they opened the door they\nwere advertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of a\nperfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance.\nNowhere was there any trace of Henry Jekyll, dead or alive.\n\nPoole stamped on the flags of the corridor. \u201cHe must be buried here,\u201d\nhe said, hearkening to the sound.\n\n\u201cOr he may have fled,\u201d said Utterson, and he turned to examine the door\nin the by-street. It was locked; and lying near by on the flags, they\nfound the key, already stained with rust.\n\n\u201cThis does not look like use,\u201d observed the lawyer.\n\n\u201cUse!\u201d echoed Poole. \u201cDo you not see, sir, it is broken? much as if a\nman had stamped on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAy,\u201d continued Utterson, \u201cand the fractures, too, are rusty.\u201d The two\nmen looked at each other with a scare. \u201cThis is beyond me, Poole,\u201d said\nthe lawyer. \u201cLet us go back to the cabinet.\u201d\n\nThey mounted the stair in silence, and still with an occasional\nawestruck glance at the dead body, proceeded more thoroughly to examine\nthe contents of the cabinet. At one table, there were traces of\nchemical work, various measured heaps of some white salt being laid on\nglass saucers, as though for an experiment in which the unhappy man had\nbeen prevented.\n\n\u201cThat is the same drug that I was always bringing him,\u201d said Poole; and\neven as he spoke, the kettle with a startling noise boiled over.\n\nThis brought them to the fireside, where the easy-chair was drawn\ncosily up, and the tea things stood ready to the sitter\u2019s elbow, the\nvery sugar in the cup. There were several books on a shelf; one lay\nbeside the tea things open, and Utterson was amazed to find it a copy\nof a pious work, for which Jekyll had several times expressed a great\nesteem, annotated, in his own hand with startling blasphemies.\n\nNext, in the course of their review of the chamber, the searchers came\nto the cheval-glass, into whose depths they looked with an involuntary\nhorror. But it was so turned as to show them nothing but the rosy glow\nplaying on the roof, the fire sparkling in a hundred repetitions along\nthe glazed front of the presses, and their own pale and fearful\ncountenances stooping to look in.\n\n\u201cThis glass has seen some strange things, sir,\u201d whispered Poole.\n\n\u201cAnd surely none stranger than itself,\u201d echoed the lawyer in the same\ntones. \u201cFor what did Jekyll\u201d\u2014he caught himself up at the word with a\nstart, and then conquering the weakness\u2014\u201cwhat could Jekyll want with\nit?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou may say that!\u201d said Poole.\n\nNext they turned to the business table. On the desk, among the neat\narray of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the\ndoctor\u2019s hand, the name of Mr. Utterson. The lawyer unsealed it, and\nseveral enclosures fell to the floor. The first was a will, drawn in\nthe same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months\nbefore, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift\nin case of disappearance; but in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the\nlawyer, with indescribable amazement read the name of Gabriel John\nUtterson. He looked at Poole, and then back at the paper, and last of\nall at the dead malefactor stretched upon the carpet.\n\n\u201cMy head goes round,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has been all these days in\npossession; he had no cause to like me; he must have raged to see\nhimself displaced; and he has not destroyed this document.\u201d\n\nHe caught up the next paper; it was a brief note in the doctor\u2019s hand\nand dated at the top. \u201cO Poole!\u201d the lawyer cried, \u201che was alive and\nhere this day. He cannot have been disposed of in so short a space; he\nmust be still alive, he must have fled! And then, why fled? and how?\nand in that case, can we venture to declare this suicide? O, we must be\ncareful. I foresee that we may yet involve your master in some dire\ncatastrophe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you read it, sir?\u201d asked Poole.\n\n\u201cBecause I fear,\u201d replied the lawyer solemnly. \u201cGod grant I have no\ncause for it!\u201d And with that he brought the paper to his eyes and read\nas follows:\n\n\n\u201cMy dear Utterson,\u2014When this shall fall into your hands, I shall have\ndisappeared, under what circumstances I have not the penetration to\nforesee, but my instinct and all the circumstances of my nameless\nsituation tell me that the end is sure and must be early. Go then, and\nfirst read the narrative which Lanyon warned me he was to place in your\nhands; and if you care to hear more, turn to the confession of\n\n\u201cYour unworthy and unhappy friend,\n\n\u201cHENRY JEKYLL.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere was a third enclosure?\u201d asked Utterson.\n\n\u201cHere, sir,\u201d said Poole, and gave into his hands a considerable packet\nsealed in several places.\n\nThe lawyer put it in his pocket. \u201cI would say nothing of this paper. If\nyour master has fled or is dead, we may at least save his credit. It is\nnow ten; I must go home and read these documents in quiet; but I shall\nbe back before midnight, when we shall send for the police.\u201d\n\nThey went out, locking the door of the theatre behind them; and\nUtterson, once more leaving the servants gathered about the fire in the\nhall, trudged back to his office to read the two narratives in which\nthis mystery was now to be explained.\n\n\n\nDR. LANYON\u2019S NARRATIVE\n\nOn the ninth of January, now four days ago, I received by the evening\ndelivery a registered envelope, addressed in the hand of my colleague\nand old school companion, Henry Jekyll. I was a good deal surprised by\nthis; for we were by no means in the habit of correspondence; I had\nseen the man, dined with him, indeed, the night before; and I could\nimagine nothing in our intercourse that should justify formality of\nregistration. The contents increased my wonder; for this is how the\nletter ran:\n\n\u201c10_th December_, 18\u2014.\n\n\n\u201cDear Lanyon,\u2014You are one of my oldest friends; and although we may\nhave differed at times on scientific questions, I cannot remember, at\nleast on my side, any break in our affection. There was never a day\nwhen, if you had said to me, \u2018Jekyll, my life, my honour, my reason,\ndepend upon you,\u2019 I would not have sacrificed my left hand to help you.\nLanyon, my life, my honour, my reason, are all at your mercy; if you\nfail me to-night, I am lost. You might suppose, after this preface,\nthat I am going to ask you for something dishonourable to grant. Judge\nfor yourself.\n\n\u201cI want you to postpone all other engagements for to-night\u2014ay, even if\nyou were summoned to the bedside of an emperor; to take a cab, unless\nyour carriage should be actually at the door; and with this letter in\nyour hand for consultation, to drive straight to my house. Poole, my\nbutler, has his orders; you will find him waiting your arrival with a\nlocksmith. The door of my cabinet is then to be forced; and you are to\ngo in alone; to open the glazed press (letter E) on the left hand,\nbreaking the lock if it be shut; and to draw out, _with all its\ncontents as they stand_, the fourth drawer from the top or (which is\nthe same thing) the third from the bottom. In my extreme distress of\nmind, I have a morbid fear of misdirecting you; but even if I am in\nerror, you may know the right drawer by its contents: some powders, a\nphial and a paper book. This drawer I beg of you to carry back with you\nto Cavendish Square exactly as it stands.\n\n\u201cThat is the first part of the service: now for the second. You should\nbe back, if you set out at once on the receipt of this, long before\nmidnight; but I will leave you that amount of margin, not only in the\nfear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented nor\nforeseen, but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to be\npreferred for what will then remain to do. At midnight, then, I have to\nask you to be alone in your consulting room, to admit with your own\nhand into the house a man who will present himself in my name, and to\nplace in his hands the drawer that you will have brought with you from\nmy cabinet. Then you will have played your part and earned my gratitude\ncompletely. Five minutes afterwards, if you insist upon an explanation,\nyou will have understood that these arrangements are of capital\nimportance; and that by the neglect of one of them, fantastic as they\nmust appear, you might have charged your conscience with my death or\nthe shipwreck of my reason.\n\n\u201cConfident as I am that you will not trifle with this appeal, my heart\nsinks and my hand trembles at the bare thought of such a possibility.\nThink of me at this hour, in a strange place, labouring under a\nblackness of distress that no fancy can exaggerate, and yet well aware\nthat, if you will but punctually serve me, my troubles will roll away\nlike a story that is told. Serve me, my dear Lanyon and save\n\n\u201cYour friend,\n\n\n\u201cH.J.\n\n\n\u201cP.S.\u2014I had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struck upon my\nsoul. It is possible that the post-office may fail me, and this letter\nnot come into your hands until to-morrow morning. In that case, dear\nLanyon, do my errand when it shall be most convenient for you in the\ncourse of the day; and once more expect my messenger at midnight. It\nmay then already be too late; and if that night passes without event,\nyou will know that you have seen the last of Henry Jekyll.\u201d\n\n\nUpon the reading of this letter, I made sure my colleague was insane;\nbut till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt, I felt bound\nto do as he requested. The less I understood of this farrago, the less\nI was in a position to judge of its importance; and an appeal so worded\ncould not be set aside without a grave responsibility. I rose\naccordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight to\nJekyll\u2019s house. The butler was awaiting my arrival; he had received by\nthe same post as mine a registered letter of instruction, and had sent\nat once for a locksmith and a carpenter. The tradesmen came while we\nwere yet speaking; and we moved in a body to old Dr. Denman\u2019s surgical\ntheatre, from which (as you are doubtless aware) Jekyll\u2019s private\ncabinet is most conveniently entered. The door was very strong, the\nlock excellent; the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble and\nhave to do much damage, if force were to be used; and the locksmith was\nnear despair. But this last was a handy fellow, and after two hour\u2019s\nwork, the door stood open. The press marked E was unlocked; and I took\nout the drawer, had it filled up with straw and tied in a sheet, and\nreturned with it to Cavendish Square.\n\nHere I proceeded to examine its contents. The powders were neatly\nenough made up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist; so\nthat it was plain they were of Jekyll\u2019s private manufacture; and when I\nopened one of the wrappers I found what seemed to me a simple\ncrystalline salt of a white colour. The phial, to which I next turned\nmy attention, might have been about half full of a blood-red liquor,\nwhich was highly pungent to the sense of smell and seemed to me to\ncontain phosphorus and some volatile ether. At the other ingredients I\ncould make no guess. The book was an ordinary version book and\ncontained little but a series of dates. These covered a period of many\nyears, but I observed that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and\nquite abruptly. Here and there a brief remark was appended to a date,\nusually no more than a single word: \u201cdouble\u201d occurring perhaps six\ntimes in a total of several hundred entries; and once very early in the\nlist and followed by several marks of exclamation, \u201ctotal failure!!!\u201d\nAll this, though it whetted my curiosity, told me little that was\ndefinite. Here were a phial of some salt, and the record of a series of\nexperiments that had led (like too many of Jekyll\u2019s investigations) to\nno end of practical usefulness. How could the presence of these\narticles in my house affect either the honour, the sanity, or the life\nof my flighty colleague? If his messenger could go to one place, why\ncould he not go to another? And even granting some impediment, why was\nthis gentleman to be received by me in secret? The more I reflected the\nmore convinced I grew that I was dealing with a case of cerebral\ndisease; and though I dismissed my servants to bed, I loaded an old\nrevolver, that I might be found in some posture of self-defence.\n\nTwelve o\u2019clock had scarce rung out over London, ere the knocker sounded\nvery gently on the door. I went myself at the summons, and found a\nsmall man crouching against the pillars of the portico.\n\n\u201cAre you come from Dr. Jekyll?\u201d I asked.\n\nHe told me \u201cyes\u201d by a constrained gesture; and when I had bidden him\nenter, he did not obey me without a searching backward glance into the\ndarkness of the square. There was a policeman not far off, advancing\nwith his bull\u2019s eye open; and at the sight, I thought my visitor\nstarted and made greater haste.\n\nThese particulars struck me, I confess, disagreeably; and as I followed\nhim into the bright light of the consulting room, I kept my hand ready\non my weapon. Here, at last, I had a chance of clearly seeing him. I\nhad never set eyes on him before, so much was certain. He was small, as\nI have said; I was struck besides with the shocking expression of his\nface, with his remarkable combination of great muscular activity and\ngreat apparent debility of constitution, and\u2014last but not least\u2014with\nthe odd, subjective disturbance caused by his neighbourhood. This bore\nsome resemblance to incipient rigour, and was accompanied by a marked\nsinking of the pulse. At the time, I set it down to some idiosyncratic,\npersonal distaste, and merely wondered at the acuteness of the\nsymptoms; but I have since had reason to believe the cause to lie much\ndeeper in the nature of man, and to turn on some nobler hinge than the\nprinciple of hatred.\n\nThis person (who had thus, from the first moment of his entrance,\nstruck in me what I can only describe as a disgustful curiosity) was\ndressed in a fashion that would have made an ordinary person laughable;\nhis clothes, that is to say, although they were of rich and sober\nfabric, were enormously too large for him in every measurement\u2014the\ntrousers hanging on his legs and rolled up to keep them from the\nground, the waist of the coat below his haunches, and the collar\nsprawling wide upon his shoulders. Strange to relate, this ludicrous\naccoutrement was far from moving me to laughter. Rather, as there was\nsomething abnormal and misbegotten in the very essence of the creature\nthat now faced me\u2014something seizing, surprising and revolting\u2014this\nfresh disparity seemed but to fit in with and to reinforce it; so that\nto my interest in the man\u2019s nature and character, there was added a\ncuriosity as to his origin, his life, his fortune and status in the\nworld.\n\nThese observations, though they have taken so great a space to be set\ndown in, were yet the work of a few seconds. My visitor was, indeed, on\nfire with sombre excitement.\n\n\u201cHave you got it?\u201d he cried. \u201cHave you got it?\u201d And so lively was his\nimpatience that he even laid his hand upon my arm and sought to shake\nme.\n\nI put him back, conscious at his touch of a certain icy pang along my\nblood. \u201cCome, sir,\u201d said I. \u201cYou forget that I have not yet the\npleasure of your acquaintance. Be seated, if you please.\u201d And I showed\nhim an example, and sat down myself in my customary seat and with as\nfair an imitation of my ordinary manner to a patient, as the lateness\nof the hour, the nature of my preoccupations, and the horror I had of\nmy visitor, would suffer me to muster.\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon, Dr. Lanyon,\u201d he replied civilly enough. \u201cWhat you\nsay is very well founded; and my impatience has shown its heels to my\npoliteness. I come here at the instance of your colleague, Dr. Henry\nJekyll, on a piece of business of some moment; and I understood...\u201d He\npaused and put his hand to his throat, and I could see, in spite of his\ncollected manner, that he was wrestling against the approaches of the\nhysteria\u2014\u201cI understood, a drawer...\u201d\n\nBut here I took pity on my visitor\u2019s suspense, and some perhaps on my\nown growing curiosity.\n\n\u201cThere it is, sir,\u201d said I, pointing to the drawer, where it lay on the\nfloor behind a table and still covered with the sheet.\n\nHe sprang to it, and then paused, and laid his hand upon his heart; I\ncould hear his teeth grate with the convulsive action of his jaws; and\nhis face was so ghastly to see that I grew alarmed both for his life\nand reason.\n\n\u201cCompose yourself,\u201d said I.\n\nHe turned a dreadful smile to me, and as if with the decision of\ndespair, plucked away the sheet. At sight of the contents, he uttered\none loud sob of such immense relief that I sat petrified. And the next\nmoment, in a voice that was already fairly well under control, \u201cHave\nyou a graduated glass?\u201d he asked.\n\nI rose from my place with something of an effort and gave him what he\nasked.\n\nHe thanked me with a smiling nod, measured out a few minims of the red\ntincture and added one of the powders. The mixture, which was at first\nof a reddish hue, began, in proportion as the crystals melted, to\nbrighten in colour, to effervesce audibly, and to throw off small fumes\nof vapour. Suddenly and at the same moment, the ebullition ceased and\nthe compound changed to a dark purple, which faded again more slowly to\na watery green. My visitor, who had watched these metamorphoses with a\nkeen eye, smiled, set down the glass upon the table, and then turned\nand looked upon me with an air of scrutiny.\n\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d said he, \u201cto settle what remains. Will you be wise? will you\nbe guided? will you suffer me to take this glass in my hand and to go\nforth from your house without further parley? or has the greed of\ncuriosity too much command of you? Think before you answer, for it\nshall be done as you decide. As you decide, you shall be left as you\nwere before, and neither richer nor wiser, unless the sense of service\nrendered to a man in mortal distress may be counted as a kind of riches\nof the soul. Or, if you shall so prefer to choose, a new province of\nknowledge and new avenues to fame and power shall be laid open to you,\nhere, in this room, upon the instant; and your sight shall be blasted\nby a prodigy to stagger the unbelief of Satan.\u201d\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d said I, affecting a coolness that I was far from truly\npossessing, \u201cyou speak enigmas, and you will perhaps not wonder that I\nhear you with no very strong impression of belief. But I have gone too\nfar in the way of inexplicable services to pause before I see the end.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is well,\u201d replied my visitor. \u201cLanyon, you remember your vows: what\nfollows is under the seal of our profession. And now, you who have so\nlong been bound to the most narrow and material views, you who have\ndenied the virtue of transcendental medicine, you who have derided your\nsuperiors\u2014behold!\u201d\n\nHe put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp. A cry followed; he\nreeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held on, staring with\ninjected eyes, gasping with open mouth; and as I looked there came, I\nthought, a change\u2014he seemed to swell\u2014his face became suddenly black and\nthe features seemed to melt and alter\u2014and the next moment, I had sprung\nto my feet and leaped back against the wall, my arms raised to shield\nme from that prodigy, my mind submerged in terror.\n\n\u201cO God!\u201d I screamed, and \u201cO God!\u201d again and again; for there before my\neyes\u2014pale and shaken, and half fainting, and groping before him with\nhis hands, like a man restored from death\u2014there stood Henry Jekyll!\n\nWhat he told me in the next hour, I cannot bring my mind to set on\npaper. I saw what I saw, I heard what I heard, and my soul sickened at\nit; and yet now when that sight has faded from my eyes, I ask myself if\nI believe it, and I cannot answer. My life is shaken to its roots;\nsleep has left me; the deadliest terror sits by me at all hours of the\nday and night; and I feel that my days are numbered, and that I must\ndie; and yet I shall die incredulous. As for the moral turpitude that\nman unveiled to me, even with tears of penitence, I cannot, even in\nmemory, dwell on it without a start of horror. I will say but one\nthing, Utterson, and that (if you can bring your mind to credit it)\nwill be more than enough. The creature who crept into my house that\nnight was, on Jekyll\u2019s own confession, known by the name of Hyde and\nhunted for in every corner of the land as the murderer of Carew.\n\nHASTIE LANYON.\n\n\n\n\nHENRY JEKYLL\u2019S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nI was born in the year 18\u2014 to a large fortune, endowed besides with\nexcellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect of\nthe wise and good among my fellowmen, and thus, as might have been\nsupposed, with every guarantee of an honourable and distinguished\nfuture. And indeed the worst of my faults was a certain impatient\ngaiety of disposition, such as has made the happiness of many, but such\nas I found it hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry my\nhead high, and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the\npublic. Hence it came about that I concealed my pleasures; and that\nwhen I reached years of reflection, and began to look round me and take\nstock of my progress and position in the world, I stood already\ncommitted to a profound duplicity of life. Many a man would have even\nblazoned such irregularities as I was guilty of; but from the high\nviews that I had set before me, I regarded and hid them with an almost\nmorbid sense of shame. It was thus rather the exacting nature of my\naspirations than any particular degradation in my faults, that made me\nwhat I was, and, with even a deeper trench than in the majority of men,\nsevered in me those provinces of good and ill which divide and compound\nman\u2019s dual nature. In this case, I was driven to reflect deeply and\ninveterately on that hard law of life, which lies at the root of\nreligion and is one of the most plentiful springs of distress. Though\nso profound a double-dealer, I was in no sense a hypocrite; both sides\nof me were in dead earnest; I was no more myself when I laid aside\nrestraint and plunged in shame, than when I laboured, in the eye of\nday, at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and\nsuffering. And it chanced that the direction of my scientific studies,\nwhich led wholly towards the mystic and the transcendental, reacted and\nshed a strong light on this consciousness of the perennial war among my\nmembers. With every day, and from both sides of my intelligence, the\nmoral and the intellectual, I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth,\nby whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful\nshipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two. I say two, because\nthe state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that point. Others\nwill follow, others will outstrip me on the same lines; and I hazard\nthe guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of\nmultifarious, incongruous and independent denizens. I, for my part,\nfrom the nature of my life, advanced infallibly in one direction and in\none direction only. It was on the moral side, and in my own person,\nthat I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man;\nI saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of my\nconsciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it was\nonly because I was radically both; and from an early date, even before\nthe course of my scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the most\nnaked possibility of such a miracle, I had learned to dwell with\npleasure, as a beloved daydream, on the thought of the separation of\nthese elements. If each, I told myself, could be housed in separate\nidentities, life would be relieved of all that was unbearable; the\nunjust might go his way, delivered from the aspirations and remorse of\nhis more upright twin; and the just could walk steadfastly and securely\non his upward path, doing the good things in which he found his\npleasure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands\nof this extraneous evil. It was the curse of mankind that these\nincongruous faggots were thus bound together\u2014that in the agonised womb\nof consciousness, these polar twins should be continuously struggling.\nHow, then were they dissociated?\n\nI was so far in my reflections when, as I have said, a side light began\nto shine upon the subject from the laboratory table. I began to\nperceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated, the trembling\nimmateriality, the mistlike transience, of this seemingly so solid body\nin which we walk attired. Certain agents I found to have the power to\nshake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss\nthe curtains of a pavilion. For two good reasons, I will not enter\ndeeply into this scientific branch of my confession. First, because I\nhave been made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound\nfor ever on man\u2019s shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast it\noff, it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful\npressure. Second, because, as my narrative will make, alas! too\nevident, my discoveries were incomplete. Enough then, that I not only\nrecognised my natural body from the mere aura and effulgence of certain\nof the powers that made up my spirit, but managed to compound a drug by\nwhich these powers should be dethroned from their supremacy, and a\nsecond form and countenance substituted, none the less natural to me\nbecause they were the expression, and bore the stamp, of lower elements\nin my soul.\n\nI hesitated long before I put this theory to the test of practice. I\nknew well that I risked death; for any drug that so potently controlled\nand shook the very fortress of identity, might, by the least scruple of\nan overdose or at the least inopportunity in the moment of exhibition,\nutterly blot out that immaterial tabernacle which I looked to it to\nchange. But the temptation of a discovery so singular and profound at\nlast overcame the suggestions of alarm. I had long since prepared my\ntincture; I purchased at once, from a firm of wholesale chemists, a\nlarge quantity of a particular salt which I knew, from my experiments,\nto be the last ingredient required; and late one accursed night, I\ncompounded the elements, watched them boil and smoke together in the\nglass, and when the ebullition had subsided, with a strong glow of\ncourage, drank off the potion.\n\nThe most racking pangs succeeded: a grinding in the bones, deadly\nnausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour\nof birth or death. Then these agonies began swiftly to subside, and I\ncame to myself as if out of a great sickness. There was something\nstrange in my sensations, something indescribably new and, from its\nvery novelty, incredibly sweet. I felt younger, lighter, happier in\nbody; within I was conscious of a heady recklessness, a current of\ndisordered sensual images running like a millrace in my fancy, a\nsolution of the bonds of obligation, an unknown but not an innocent\nfreedom of the soul. I knew myself, at the first breath of this new\nlife, to be more wicked, tenfold more wicked, sold a slave to my\noriginal evil; and the thought, in that moment, braced and delighted me\nlike wine. I stretched out my hands, exulting in the freshness of these\nsensations; and in the act, I was suddenly aware that I had lost in\nstature.\n\nThere was no mirror, at that date, in my room; that which stands beside\nme as I write, was brought there later on and for the very purpose of\nthese transformations. The night however, was far gone into the\nmorning\u2014the morning, black as it was, was nearly ripe for the\nconception of the day\u2014the inmates of my house were locked in the most\nrigorous hours of slumber; and I determined, flushed as I was with hope\nand triumph, to venture in my new shape as far as to my bedroom. I\ncrossed the yard, wherein the constellations looked down upon me, I\ncould have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that sort that\ntheir unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to them; I stole through\nthe corridors, a stranger in my own house; and coming to my room, I saw\nfor the first time the appearance of Edward Hyde.\n\nI must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which I know, but\nthat which I suppose to be most probable. The evil side of my nature,\nto which I had now transferred the stamping efficacy, was less robust\nand less developed than the good which I had just deposed. Again, in\nthe course of my life, which had been, after all, nine tenths a life of\neffort, virtue and control, it had been much less exercised and much\nless exhausted. And hence, as I think, it came about that Edward Hyde\nwas so much smaller, slighter and younger than Henry Jekyll. Even as\ngood shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly\nand plainly on the face of the other. Evil besides (which I must still\nbelieve to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an imprint\nof deformity and decay. And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol in\nthe glass, I was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of\nwelcome. This, too, was myself. It seemed natural and human. In my eyes\nit bore a livelier image of the spirit, it seemed more express and\nsingle, than the imperfect and divided countenance I had been hitherto\naccustomed to call mine. And in so far I was doubtless right. I have\nobserved that when I wore the semblance of Edward Hyde, none could come\nnear to me at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh. This, as\nI take it, was because all human beings, as we meet them, are\ncommingled out of good and evil: and Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of\nmankind, was pure evil.\n\nI lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive\nexperiment had yet to be attempted; it yet remained to be seen if I had\nlost my identity beyond redemption and must flee before daylight from a\nhouse that was no longer mine; and hurrying back to my cabinet, I once\nmore prepared and drank the cup, once more suffered the pangs of\ndissolution, and came to myself once more with the character, the\nstature and the face of Henry Jekyll.\n\nThat night I had come to the fatal cross-roads. Had I approached my\ndiscovery in a more noble spirit, had I risked the experiment while\nunder the empire of generous or pious aspirations, all must have been\notherwise, and from these agonies of death and birth, I had come forth\nan angel instead of a fiend. The drug had no discriminating action; it\nwas neither diabolical nor divine; it but shook the doors of the\nprisonhouse of my disposition; and like the captives of Philippi, that\nwhich stood within ran forth. At that time my virtue slumbered; my\nevil, kept awake by ambition, was alert and swift to seize the\noccasion; and the thing that was projected was Edward Hyde. Hence,\nalthough I had now two characters as well as two appearances, one was\nwholly evil, and the other was still the old Henry Jekyll, that\nincongruous compound of whose reformation and improvement I had already\nlearned to despair. The movement was thus wholly toward the worse.\n\nEven at that time, I had not conquered my aversions to the dryness of a\nlife of study. I would still be merrily disposed at times; and as my\npleasures were (to say the least) undignified, and I was not only well\nknown and highly considered, but growing towards the elderly man, this\nincoherency of my life was daily growing more unwelcome. It was on this\nside that my new power tempted me until I fell in slavery. I had but to\ndrink the cup, to doff at once the body of the noted professor, and to\nassume, like a thick cloak, that of Edward Hyde. I smiled at the\nnotion; it seemed to me at the time to be humourous; and I made my\npreparations with the most studious care. I took and furnished that\nhouse in Soho, to which Hyde was tracked by the police; and engaged as\na housekeeper a creature whom I knew well to be silent and\nunscrupulous. On the other side, I announced to my servants that a Mr.\nHyde (whom I described) was to have full liberty and power about my\nhouse in the square; and to parry mishaps, I even called and made\nmyself a familiar object, in my second character. I next drew up that\nwill to which you so much objected; so that if anything befell me in\nthe person of Dr. Jekyll, I could enter on that of Edward Hyde without\npecuniary loss. And thus fortified, as I supposed, on every side, I\nbegan to profit by the strange immunities of my position.\n\nMen have before hired bravos to transact their crimes, while their own\nperson and reputation sat under shelter. I was the first that ever did\nso for his pleasures. I was the first that could plod in the public eye\nwith a load of genial respectability, and in a moment, like a\nschoolboy, strip off these lendings and spring headlong into the sea of\nliberty. But for me, in my impenetrable mantle, the safety was\ncomplete. Think of it\u2014I did not even exist! Let me but escape into my\nlaboratory door, give me but a second or two to mix and swallow the\ndraught that I had always standing ready; and whatever he had done,\nEdward Hyde would pass away like the stain of breath upon a mirror; and\nthere in his stead, quietly at home, trimming the midnight lamp in his\nstudy, a man who could afford to laugh at suspicion, would be Henry\nJekyll.\n\nThe pleasures which I made haste to seek in my disguise were, as I have\nsaid, undignified; I would scarce use a harder term. But in the hands\nof Edward Hyde, they soon began to turn toward the monstrous. When I\nwould come back from these excursions, I was often plunged into a kind\nof wonder at my vicarious depravity. This familiar that I called out of\nmy own soul, and sent forth alone to do his good pleasure, was a being\ninherently malign and villainous; his every act and thought centered on\nself; drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of torture\nto another; relentless like a man of stone. Henry Jekyll stood at times\naghast before the acts of Edward Hyde; but the situation was apart from\nordinary laws, and insidiously relaxed the grasp of conscience. It was\nHyde, after all, and Hyde alone, that was guilty. Jekyll was no worse;\nhe woke again to his good qualities seemingly unimpaired; he would even\nmake haste, where it was possible, to undo the evil done by Hyde. And\nthus his conscience slumbered.\n\nInto the details of the infamy at which I thus connived (for even now I\ncan scarce grant that I committed it) I have no design of entering; I\nmean but to point out the warnings and the successive steps with which\nmy chastisement approached. I met with one accident which, as it\nbrought on no consequence, I shall no more than mention. An act of\ncruelty to a child aroused against me the anger of a passer-by, whom I\nrecognised the other day in the person of your kinsman; the doctor and\nthe child\u2019s family joined him; there were moments when I feared for my\nlife; and at last, in order to pacify their too just resentment, Edward\nHyde had to bring them to the door, and pay them in a cheque drawn in\nthe name of Henry Jekyll. But this danger was easily eliminated from\nthe future, by opening an account at another bank in the name of Edward\nHyde himself; and when, by sloping my own hand backward, I had supplied\nmy double with a signature, I thought I sat beyond the reach of fate.\n\nSome two months before the murder of Sir Danvers, I had been out for\none of my adventures, had returned at a late hour, and woke the next\nday in bed with somewhat odd sensations. It was in vain I looked about\nme; in vain I saw the decent furniture and tall proportions of my room\nin the square; in vain that I recognised the pattern of the bed\ncurtains and the design of the mahogany frame; something still kept\ninsisting that I was not where I was, that I had not wakened where I\nseemed to be, but in the little room in Soho where I was accustomed to\nsleep in the body of Edward Hyde. I smiled to myself, and in my\npsychological way, began lazily to inquire into the elements of this\nillusion, occasionally, even as I did so, dropping back into a\ncomfortable morning doze. I was still so engaged when, in one of my\nmore wakeful moments, my eyes fell upon my hand. Now the hand of Henry\nJekyll (as you have often remarked) was professional in shape and size;\nit was large, firm, white and comely. But the hand which I now saw,\nclearly enough, in the yellow light of a mid-London morning, lying half\nshut on the bedclothes, was lean, corded, knuckly, of a dusky pallor\nand thickly shaded with a swart growth of hair. It was the hand of\nEdward Hyde.\n\nI must have stared upon it for near half a minute, sunk as I was in the\nmere stupidity of wonder, before terror woke up in my breast as sudden\nand startling as the crash of cymbals; and bounding from my bed I\nrushed to the mirror. At the sight that met my eyes, my blood was\nchanged into something exquisitely thin and icy. Yes, I had gone to bed\nHenry Jekyll, I had awakened Edward Hyde. How was this to be explained?\nI asked myself; and then, with another bound of terror\u2014how was it to be\nremedied? It was well on in the morning; the servants were up; all my\ndrugs were in the cabinet\u2014a long journey down two pairs of stairs,\nthrough the back passage, across the open court and through the\nanatomical theatre, from where I was then standing horror-struck. It\nmight indeed be possible to cover my face; but of what use was that,\nwhen I was unable to conceal the alteration in my stature? And then\nwith an overpowering sweetness of relief, it came back upon my mind\nthat the servants were already used to the coming and going of my\nsecond self. I had soon dressed, as well as I was able, in clothes of\nmy own size: had soon passed through the house, where Bradshaw stared\nand drew back at seeing Mr. Hyde at such an hour and in such a strange\narray; and ten minutes later, Dr. Jekyll had returned to his own shape\nand was sitting down, with a darkened brow, to make a feint of\nbreakfasting.\n\nSmall indeed was my appetite. This inexplicable incident, this reversal\nof my previous experience, seemed, like the Babylonian finger on the\nwall, to be spelling out the letters of my judgment; and I began to\nreflect more seriously than ever before on the issues and possibilities\nof my double existence. That part of me which I had the power of\nprojecting, had lately been much exercised and nourished; it had seemed\nto me of late as though the body of Edward Hyde had grown in stature,\nas though (when I wore that form) I were conscious of a more generous\ntide of blood; and I began to spy a danger that, if this were much\nprolonged, the balance of my nature might be permanently overthrown,\nthe power of voluntary change be forfeited, and the character of Edward\nHyde become irrevocably mine. The power of the drug had not been always\nequally displayed. Once, very early in my career, it had totally failed\nme; since then I had been obliged on more than one occasion to double,\nand once, with infinite risk of death, to treble the amount; and these\nrare uncertainties had cast hitherto the sole shadow on my contentment.\nNow, however, and in the light of that morning\u2019s accident, I was led to\nremark that whereas, in the beginning, the difficulty had been to throw\noff the body of Jekyll, it had of late gradually but decidedly\ntransferred itself to the other side. All things therefore seemed to\npoint to this; that I was slowly losing hold of my original and better\nself, and becoming slowly incorporated with my second and worse.\n\nBetween these two, I now felt I had to choose. My two natures had\nmemory in common, but all other faculties were most unequally shared\nbetween them. Jekyll (who was composite) now with the most sensitive\napprehensions, now with a greedy gusto, projected and shared in the\npleasures and adventures of Hyde; but Hyde was indifferent to Jekyll,\nor but remembered him as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in\nwhich he conceals himself from pursuit. Jekyll had more than a father\u2019s\ninterest; Hyde had more than a son\u2019s indifference. To cast in my lot\nwith Jekyll, was to die to those appetites which I had long secretly\nindulged and had of late begun to pamper. To cast it in with Hyde, was\nto die to a thousand interests and aspirations, and to become, at a\nblow and forever, despised and friendless. The bargain might appear\nunequal; but there was still another consideration in the scales; for\nwhile Jekyll would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence, Hyde\nwould be not even conscious of all that he had lost. Strange as my\ncircumstances were, the terms of this debate are as old and commonplace\nas man; much the same inducements and alarms cast the die for any\ntempted and trembling sinner; and it fell out with me, as it falls with\nso vast a majority of my fellows, that I chose the better part and was\nfound wanting in the strength to keep to it.\n\nYes, I preferred the elderly and discontented doctor, surrounded by\nfriends and cherishing honest hopes; and bade a resolute farewell to\nthe liberty, the comparative youth, the light step, leaping impulses\nand secret pleasures, that I had enjoyed in the disguise of Hyde. I\nmade this choice perhaps with some unconscious reservation, for I\nneither gave up the house in Soho, nor destroyed the clothes of Edward\nHyde, which still lay ready in my cabinet. For two months, however, I\nwas true to my determination; for two months, I led a life of such\nseverity as I had never before attained to, and enjoyed the\ncompensations of an approving conscience. But time began at last to\nobliterate the freshness of my alarm; the praises of conscience began\nto grow into a thing of course; I began to be tortured with throes and\nlongings, as of Hyde struggling after freedom; and at last, in an hour\nof moral weakness, I once again compounded and swallowed the\ntransforming draught.\n\nI do not suppose that, when a drunkard reasons with himself upon his\nvice, he is once out of five hundred times affected by the dangers that\nhe runs through his brutish, physical insensibility; neither had I,\nlong as I had considered my position, made enough allowance for the\ncomplete moral insensibility and insensate readiness to evil, which\nwere the leading characters of Edward Hyde. Yet it was by these that I\nwas punished. My devil had been long caged, he came out roaring. I was\nconscious, even when I took the draught, of a more unbridled, a more\nfurious propensity to ill. It must have been this, I suppose, that\nstirred in my soul that tempest of impatience with which I listened to\nthe civilities of my unhappy victim; I declare, at least, before God,\nno man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so\npitiful a provocation; and that I struck in no more reasonable spirit\nthan that in which a sick child may break a plaything. But I had\nvoluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts by which\neven the worst of us continues to walk with some degree of steadiness\namong temptations; and in my case, to be tempted, however slightly, was\nto fall.\n\nInstantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged. With a transport of\nglee, I mauled the unresisting body, tasting delight from every blow;\nand it was not till weariness had begun to succeed, that I was\nsuddenly, in the top fit of my delirium, struck through the heart by a\ncold thrill of terror. A mist dispersed; I saw my life to be forfeit;\nand fled from the scene of these excesses, at once glorying and\ntrembling, my lust of evil gratified and stimulated, my love of life\nscrewed to the topmost peg. I ran to the house in Soho, and (to make\nassurance doubly sure) destroyed my papers; thence I set out through\nthe lamplit streets, in the same divided ecstasy of mind, gloating on\nmy crime, light-headedly devising others in the future, and yet still\nhastening and still hearkening in my wake for the steps of the avenger.\nHyde had a song upon his lips as he compounded the draught, and as he\ndrank it, pledged the dead man. The pangs of transformation had not\ndone tearing him, before Henry Jekyll, with streaming tears of\ngratitude and remorse, had fallen upon his knees and lifted his clasped\nhands to God. The veil of self-indulgence was rent from head to foot. I\nsaw my life as a whole: I followed it up from the days of childhood,\nwhen I had walked with my father\u2019s hand, and through the self-denying\ntoils of my professional life, to arrive again and again, with the same\nsense of unreality, at the damned horrors of the evening. I could have\nscreamed aloud; I sought with tears and prayers to smother down the\ncrowd of hideous images and sounds with which my memory swarmed against\nme; and still, between the petitions, the ugly face of my iniquity\nstared into my soul. As the acuteness of this remorse began to die\naway, it was succeeded by a sense of joy. The problem of my conduct was\nsolved. Hyde was thenceforth impossible; whether I would or not, I was\nnow confined to the better part of my existence; and O, how I rejoiced\nto think of it! with what willing humility I embraced anew the\nrestrictions of natural life! with what sincere renunciation I locked\nthe door by which I had so often gone and come, and ground the key\nunder my heel!\n\nThe next day, came the news that the murder had not been overlooked,\nthat the guilt of Hyde was patent to the world, and that the victim was\na man high in public estimation. It was not only a crime, it had been a\ntragic folly. I think I was glad to know it; I think I was glad to have\nmy better impulses thus buttressed and guarded by the terrors of the\nscaffold. Jekyll was now my city of refuge; let but Hyde peep out an\ninstant, and the hands of all men would be raised to take and slay him.\n\nI resolved in my future conduct to redeem the past; and I can say with\nhonesty that my resolve was fruitful of some good. You know yourself\nhow earnestly, in the last months of the last year, I laboured to\nrelieve suffering; you know that much was done for others, and that the\ndays passed quietly, almost happily for myself. Nor can I truly say\nthat I wearied of this beneficent and innocent life; I think instead\nthat I daily enjoyed it more completely; but I was still cursed with my\nduality of purpose; and as the first edge of my penitence wore off, the\nlower side of me, so long indulged, so recently chained down, began to\ngrowl for licence. Not that I dreamed of resuscitating Hyde; the bare\nidea of that would startle me to frenzy: no, it was in my own person\nthat I was once more tempted to trifle with my conscience; and it was\nas an ordinary secret sinner that I at last fell before the assaults of\ntemptation.\n\nThere comes an end to all things; the most capacious measure is filled\nat last; and this brief condescension to my evil finally destroyed the\nbalance of my soul. And yet I was not alarmed; the fall seemed natural,\nlike a return to the old days before I had made my discovery. It was a\nfine, clear, January day, wet under foot where the frost had melted,\nbut cloudless overhead; and the Regent\u2019s Park was full of winter\nchirrupings and sweet with spring odours. I sat in the sun on a bench;\nthe animal within me licking the chops of memory; the spiritual side a\nlittle drowsed, promising subsequent penitence, but not yet moved to\nbegin. After all, I reflected, I was like my neighbours; and then I\nsmiled, comparing myself with other men, comparing my active good-will\nwith the lazy cruelty of their neglect. And at the very moment of that\nvainglorious thought, a qualm came over me, a horrid nausea and the\nmost deadly shuddering. These passed away, and left me faint; and then\nas in its turn faintness subsided, I began to be aware of a change in\nthe temper of my thoughts, a greater boldness, a contempt of danger, a\nsolution of the bonds of obligation. I looked down; my clothes hung\nformlessly on my shrunken limbs; the hand that lay on my knee was\ncorded and hairy. I was once more Edward Hyde. A moment before I had\nbeen safe of all men\u2019s respect, wealthy, beloved\u2014the cloth laying for\nme in the dining-room at home; and now I was the common quarry of\nmankind, hunted, houseless, a known murderer, thrall to the gallows.\n\nMy reason wavered, but it did not fail me utterly. I have more than\nonce observed that in my second character, my faculties seemed\nsharpened to a point and my spirits more tensely elastic; thus it came\nabout that, where Jekyll perhaps might have succumbed, Hyde rose to the\nimportance of the moment. My drugs were in one of the presses of my\ncabinet; how was I to reach them? That was the problem that (crushing\nmy temples in my hands) I set myself to solve. The laboratory door I\nhad closed. If I sought to enter by the house, my own servants would\nconsign me to the gallows. I saw I must employ another hand, and\nthought of Lanyon. How was he to be reached? how persuaded? Supposing\nthat I escaped capture in the streets, how was I to make my way into\nhis presence? and how should I, an unknown and displeasing visitor,\nprevail on the famous physician to rifle the study of his colleague,\nDr. Jekyll? Then I remembered that of my original character, one part\nremained to me: I could write my own hand; and once I had conceived\nthat kindling spark, the way that I must follow became lighted up from\nend to end.\n\nThereupon, I arranged my clothes as best I could, and summoning a\npassing hansom, drove to an hotel in Portland Street, the name of which\nI chanced to remember. At my appearance (which was indeed comical\nenough, however tragic a fate these garments covered) the driver could\nnot conceal his mirth. I gnashed my teeth upon him with a gust of\ndevilish fury; and the smile withered from his face\u2014happily for him\u2014yet\nmore happily for myself, for in another instant I had certainly dragged\nhim from his perch. At the inn, as I entered, I looked about me with so\nblack a countenance as made the attendants tremble; not a look did they\nexchange in my presence; but obsequiously took my orders, led me to a\nprivate room, and brought me wherewithal to write. Hyde in danger of\nhis life was a creature new to me; shaken with inordinate anger, strung\nto the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain. Yet the creature was\nastute; mastered his fury with a great effort of the will; composed his\ntwo important letters, one to Lanyon and one to Poole; and that he\nmight receive actual evidence of their being posted, sent them out with\ndirections that they should be registered. Thenceforward, he sat all\nday over the fire in the private room, gnawing his nails; there he\ndined, sitting alone with his fears, the waiter visibly quailing before\nhis eye; and thence, when the night was fully come, he set forth in the\ncorner of a closed cab, and was driven to and fro about the streets of\nthe city. He, I say\u2014I cannot say, I. That child of Hell had nothing\nhuman; nothing lived in him but fear and hatred. And when at last,\nthinking the driver had begun to grow suspicious, he discharged the cab\nand ventured on foot, attired in his misfitting clothes, an object\nmarked out for observation, into the midst of the nocturnal passengers,\nthese two base passions raged within him like a tempest. He walked\nfast, hunted by his fears, chattering to himself, skulking through the\nless frequented thoroughfares, counting the minutes that still divided\nhim from midnight. Once a woman spoke to him, offering, I think, a box\nof lights. He smote her in the face, and she fled.\n\nWhen I came to myself at Lanyon\u2019s, the horror of my old friend perhaps\naffected me somewhat: I do not know; it was at least but a drop in the\nsea to the abhorrence with which I looked back upon these hours. A\nchange had come over me. It was no longer the fear of the gallows, it\nwas the horror of being Hyde that racked me. I received Lanyon\u2019s\ncondemnation partly in a dream; it was partly in a dream that I came\nhome to my own house and got into bed. I slept after the prostration of\nthe day, with a stringent and profound slumber which not even the\nnightmares that wrung me could avail to break. I awoke in the morning\nshaken, weakened, but refreshed. I still hated and feared the thought\nof the brute that slept within me, and I had not of course forgotten\nthe appalling dangers of the day before; but I was once more at home,\nin my own house and close to my drugs; and gratitude for my escape\nshone so strong in my soul that it almost rivalled the brightness of\nhope.\n\nI was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfast, drinking the\nchill of the air with pleasure, when I was seized again with those\nindescribable sensations that heralded the change; and I had but the\ntime to gain the shelter of my cabinet, before I was once again raging\nand freezing with the passions of Hyde. It took on this occasion a\ndouble dose to recall me to myself; and alas! six hours after, as I sat\nlooking sadly in the fire, the pangs returned, and the drug had to be\nre-administered. In short, from that day forth it seemed only by a\ngreat effort as of gymnastics, and only under the immediate stimulation\nof the drug, that I was able to wear the countenance of Jekyll. At all\nhours of the day and night, I would be taken with the premonitory\nshudder; above all, if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair,\nit was always as Hyde that I awakened. Under the strain of this\ncontinually impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which I now\ncondemned myself, ay, even beyond what I had thought possible to man, I\nbecame, in my own person, a creature eaten up and emptied by fever,\nlanguidly weak both in body and mind, and solely occupied by one\nthought: the horror of my other self. But when I slept, or when the\nvirtue of the medicine wore off, I would leap almost without transition\n(for the pangs of transformation grew daily less marked) into the\npossession of a fancy brimming with images of terror, a soul boiling\nwith causeless hatreds, and a body that seemed not strong enough to\ncontain the raging energies of life. The powers of Hyde seemed to have\ngrown with the sickliness of Jekyll. And certainly the hate that now\ndivided them was equal on each side. With Jekyll, it was a thing of\nvital instinct. He had now seen the full deformity of that creature\nthat shared with him some of the phenomena of consciousness, and was\nco-heir with him to death: and beyond these links of community, which\nin themselves made the most poignant part of his distress, he thought\nof Hyde, for all his energy of life, as of something not only hellish\nbut inorganic. This was the shocking thing; that the slime of the pit\nseemed to utter cries and voices; that the amorphous dust gesticulated\nand sinned; that what was dead, and had no shape, should usurp the\noffices of life. And this again, that that insurgent horror was knit to\nhim closer than a wife, closer than an eye; lay caged in his flesh,\nwhere he heard it mutter and felt it struggle to be born; and at every\nhour of weakness, and in the confidence of slumber, prevailed against\nhim, and deposed him out of life. The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll was of\na different order. His terror of the gallows drove him continually to\ncommit temporary suicide, and return to his subordinate station of a\npart instead of a person; but he loathed the necessity, he loathed the\ndespondency into which Jekyll was now fallen, and he resented the\ndislike with which he was himself regarded. Hence the ape-like tricks\nthat he would play me, scrawling in my own hand blasphemies on the\npages of my books, burning the letters and destroying the portrait of\nmy father; and indeed, had it not been for his fear of death, he would\nlong ago have ruined himself in order to involve me in the ruin. But\nhis love of life is wonderful; I go further: I, who sicken and freeze at\nthe mere thought of him, when I recall the abjection and passion of\nthis attachment, and when I know how he fears my power to cut him off\nby suicide, I find it in my heart to pity him.\n\nIt is useless, and the time awfully fails me, to prolong this\ndescription; no one has ever suffered such torments, let that suffice;\nand yet even to these, habit brought\u2014no, not alleviation\u2014but a certain\ncallousness of soul, a certain acquiescence of despair; and my\npunishment might have gone on for years, but for the last calamity\nwhich has now fallen, and which has finally severed me from my own face\nand nature. My provision of the salt, which had never been renewed\nsince the date of the first experiment, began to run low. I sent out\nfor a fresh supply and mixed the draught; the ebullition followed, and\nthe first change of colour, not the second; I drank it and it was\nwithout efficiency. You will learn from Poole how I have had London\nransacked; it was in vain; and I am now persuaded that my first supply\nwas impure, and that it was that unknown impurity which lent efficacy\nto the draught.\n\nAbout a week has passed, and I am now finishing this statement under\nthe influence of the last of the old powders. This, then, is the last\ntime, short of a miracle, that Henry Jekyll can think his own thoughts\nor see his own face (now how sadly altered!) in the glass. Nor must I\ndelay too long to bring my writing to an end; for if my narrative has\nhitherto escaped destruction, it has been by a combination of great\nprudence and great good luck. Should the throes of change take me in\nthe act of writing it, Hyde will tear it in pieces; but if some time\nshall have elapsed after I have laid it by, his wonderful selfishness\nand circumscription to the moment will probably save it once again from\nthe action of his ape-like spite. And indeed the doom that is closing\non us both has already changed and crushed him. Half an hour from now,\nwhen I shall again and forever reindue that hated personality, I know\nhow I shall sit shuddering and weeping in my chair, or continue, with\nthe most strained and fearstruck ecstasy of listening, to pace up and\ndown this room (my last earthly refuge) and give ear to every sound of\nmenace. Will Hyde die upon the scaffold? or will he find courage to\nrelease himself at the last moment? God knows; I am careless; this is\nmy true hour of death, and what is to follow concerns another than\nmyself. Here then, as I lay down the pen and proceed to seal up my\nconfession, I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end.\n\n\n\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE STRANGE CASE OF DR.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\ngenerations.

Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.

Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.",

Auguste Dupin, in his little back\n      library, or book-closet, _au troisi\u00e8me_, No. 33, _Rue Dun\u00f4t,\n      Faubourg St. Germain_. For one hour at least we had maintained a\n      profound silence; while each, to any casual observer, might have\n      seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies\n      of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber. For\n      myself, however, I was mentally discussing certain topics which\n      had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier\n      period of the evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and\n      the mystery attending the murder of Marie Rog\u00eat. I looked upon\n      it, therefore, as something of a coincidence, when the door of\n      our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance,\n      Monsieur G\u2014\u2014, the Prefect of the Parisian police.\n\n      We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much\n      of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we\n      had not seen him for several years. We had been sitting in the\n      dark, and Dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp, but\n      sat down again, without doing so, upon G.\u2018s saying that he had\n      called to consult us, or rather to ask the opinion of my friend,\n      about some official business which had occasioned a great deal of\n      trouble.\n\n      \u201cIf it is any point requiring reflection,\u201d observed Dupin, as he\n      forebore to enkindle the wick, \u201cwe shall examine it to better\n      purpose in the dark.\u201d\n\n      \u201cThat is another of your odd notions,\u201d said the Prefect, who had\n      a fashion of calling every thing \u201codd\u201d that was beyond his\n      comprehension, and thus lived amid an absolute legion of\n      \u201coddities.\u201d\n\n      \u201cVery true,\u201d said Dupin, as he supplied his visitor with a pipe,\n      and rolled towards him a comfortable chair.\n\n      \u201cAnd what is the difficulty now?\u201d I asked. \u201cNothing more in the\n      assassination way, I hope?\u201d\n\n      \u201cOh no; nothing of that nature. The fact is, the business is very\n      simple indeed, and I make no doubt that we can manage it\n      sufficiently well ourselves; but then I thought Dupin would like\n      to hear the details of it, because it is so excessively odd.\u201d\n\n      \u201cSimple and odd,\u201d said Dupin.\n\n      \u201cWhy, yes; and not exactly that, either. The fact is, we have all\n      been a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple, and yet\n      baffles us altogether.\u201d\n\n      \u201cPerhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at\n      fault,\u201d said my friend.\n\n      \u201cWhat nonsense you do talk!\u201d replied the Prefect, laughing\n      heartily.\n\n      \u201cPerhaps the mystery is a little too plain,\u201d said Dupin.\n\n      \u201cOh, good heavens! who ever heard of such an idea?\u201d\n\n      \u201cA little too self-evident.\u201d\n\n      \u201cHa! ha! ha\u2014ha! ha! ha!\u2014ho! ho! ho!\u201d roared our visitor,\n      profoundly amused, \u201coh, Dupin, you will be the death of me yet!\u201d\n\n      \u201cAnd what, after all, is the matter on hand?\u201d I asked.\n\n      \u201cWhy, I will tell you,\u201d replied the Prefect, as he gave a long,\n      steady and contemplative puff, and settled himself in his chair.\n      \u201cI will tell you in a few words; but, before I begin, let me\n      caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest\n      secrecy, and that I should most probably lose the position I now\n      hold, were it known that I confided it to any one.\u201d\n\n      \u201cProceed,\u201d said I.\n\n      \u201cOr not,\u201d said Dupin.\n\n      \u201cWell, then; I have received personal information, from a very\n      high quarter, that a certain document of the last importance has\n      been purloined from the royal apartments. The individual who\n      purloined it is known; this beyond a doubt; he was seen to take\n      it. It is known, also, that it still remains in his possession.\u201d\n\n      \u201cHow is this known?\u201d asked Dupin.\n\n      \u201cIt is clearly inferred,\u201d replied the Prefect, \u201cfrom the nature\n      of the document, and from the non-appearance of certain results\n      which would at once arise from its passing out of the robber\u2019s\n      possession; that is to say, from his employing it as he must\n      design in the end to employ it.\u201d\n\n      \u201cBe a little more explicit,\u201d I said.\n\n      \u201cWell, I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its\n      holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is\n      immensely valuable.\u201d The Prefect was fond of the cant of\n      diplomacy.\n\n      \u201cStill I do not quite understand,\u201d said Dupin.\n\n      \u201cNo? Well; the disclosure of the document to a third person, who\n      shall be nameless, would bring in question the honor of a\n      personage of most exalted station; and this fact gives the holder\n      of the document an ascendancy over the illustrious personage\n      whose honor and peace are so jeopardized.\u201d\n\n      \u201cBut this ascendancy,\u201d I interposed, \u201cwould depend upon the\n      robber\u2019s knowledge of the loser\u2019s knowledge of the robber. Who\n      would dare\u2014\u201d\n\n      \u201cThe thief,\u201d said G., \u201cis the Minister D\u2014\u2014, who dares all things,\n      those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man. The method of\n      the theft was not less ingenious than bold. The document in\n      question\u2014a letter, to be frank\u2014had been received by the personage\n      robbed while alone in the royal boudoir. During its perusal she\n      was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted\n      personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it.\n      After a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer, she\n      was forced to place it, open as it was, upon a table. The\n      address, however, was uppermost, and, the contents thus\n      unexposed, the letter escaped notice. At this juncture enters the\n      Minister D\u2014\u2014. His lynx eye immediately perceives the paper,\n      recognises the handwriting of the address, observes the confusion\n      of the personage addressed, and fathoms her secret. After some\n      business transactions, hurried through in his ordinary manner, he\n      produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question, opens\n      it, pretends to read it, and then places it in close\n      juxtaposition to the other. Again he converses, for some fifteen\n      minutes, upon the public affairs. At length, in taking leave, he\n      takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim.\n      Its rightful owner saw, but, of course, dared not call attention\n      to the act, in the presence of the third personage who stood at\n      her elbow. The minister decamped; leaving his own letter\u2014one of\n      no importance\u2014upon the table.\u201d\n\n      \u201cHere, then,\u201d said Dupin to me, \u201cyou have precisely what you\n      demand to make the ascendancy complete\u2014the robber\u2019s knowledge of\n      the loser\u2019s knowledge of the robber.\u201d\n\n      \u201cYes,\u201d replied the Prefect; \u201cand the power thus attained has, for\n      some months past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very\n      dangerous extent. The personage robbed is more thoroughly\n      convinced, every day, of the necessity of reclaiming her letter.\n      But this, of course, cannot be done openly. In fine, driven to\n      despair, she has committed the matter to me.\u201d\n\n      \u201cThan whom,\u201d said Dupin, amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke, \u201cno\n      more sagacious agent could, I suppose, be desired, or even\n      imagined.\u201d\n\n      \u201cYou flatter me,\u201d replied the Prefect; \u201cbut it is possible that\n      some such opinion may have been entertained.\u201d\n\n      \u201cIt is clear,\u201d said I, \u201cas you observe, that the letter is still\n      in possession of the minister; since it is this possession, and\n      not any employment of the letter, which bestows the power. With\n      the employment the power departs.\u201d\n\n      \u201cTrue,\u201d said G.; \u201cand upon this conviction I proceeded. My first\n      care was to make thorough search of the minister\u2019s hotel; and\n      here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching\n      without his knowledge. Beyond all things, I have been warned of\n      the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect\n      our design.\u201d\n\n      \u201cBut,\u201d said I, \u201cyou are quite au fait in these investigations.\n      The Parisian police have done this thing often before.\u201d\n\n      \u201cOh, yes; and for this reason I did not despair. The habits of\n      the minister gave me, too, a great advantage. He is frequently\n      absent from home all night. His servants are by no means\n      numerous. They sleep at a distance from their master\u2019s apartment,\n      and, being chiefly Neapolitans, are readily made drunk. I have\n      keys, as you know, with which I can open any chamber or cabinet\n      in Paris. For three months a night has not passed, during the\n      greater part of which I have not been engaged, personally, in\n      ransacking the D\u2014\u2014 Hotel. My honor is interested, and, to mention\n      a great secret, the reward is enormous. So I did not abandon the\n      search until I had become fully satisfied that the thief is a\n      more astute man than myself. I fancy that I have investigated\n      every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible\n      that the paper can be concealed.\u201d\n\n      \u201cBut is it not possible,\u201d I suggested, \u201cthat although the letter\n      may be in possession of the minister, as it unquestionably is, he\n      may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises?\u201d\n\n      \u201cThis is barely possible,\u201d said Dupin. \u201cThe present peculiar\n      condition of affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues\n      in which D\u2014\u2014 is known to be involved, would render the instant\n      availability of the document\u2014its susceptibility of being produced\n      at a moment\u2019s notice\u2014a point of nearly equal importance with its\n      possession.\u201d\n\n      \u201cIts susceptibility of being produced?\u201d said I.\n\n      \u201cThat is to say, of being destroyed,\u201d said Dupin.\n\n      \u201cTrue,\u201d I observed; \u201cthe paper is clearly then upon the premises.\n      As for its being upon the person of the minister, we may consider\n      that as out of the question.\u201d\n\n      \u201cEntirely,\u201d said the Prefect. \u201cHe has been twice waylaid, as if\n      by footpads, and his person rigorously searched under my own\n      inspection.\u201d\n\n      \u201cYou might have spared yourself this trouble,\u201d said Dupin. \u201cD\u2014\u2014,\n      I presume, is not altogether a fool, and, if not, must have\n      anticipated these waylayings, as a matter of course.\u201d\n\n      \u201cNot altogether a fool,\u201d said G., \u201cbut then he\u2019s a poet, which I\n      take to be only one remove from a fool.\u201d\n\n      \u201cTrue,\u201d said Dupin, after a long and thoughtful whiff from his\n      meerschaum, \u201calthough I have been guilty of certain doggrel\n      myself.\u201d\n\n      \u201cSuppose you detail,\u201d said I, \u201cthe particulars of your search.\u201d\n\n      \u201cWhy the fact is, we took our time, and we searched _everywhere_.\n      I have had long experience in these affairs. I took the entire\n      building, room by room; devoting the nights of a whole week to\n      each. We examined, first, the furniture of each apartment. We\n      opened every possible drawer; and I presume you know that, to a\n      properly trained police agent, such a thing as a secret drawer is\n      impossible. Any man is a dolt who permits a \u2018secret\u2019 drawer to\n      escape him in a search of this kind. The thing is so plain. There\n      is a certain amount of bulk\u2014of space\u2014to be accounted for in every\n      cabinet. Then we have accurate rules. The fiftieth part of a line\n      could not escape us. After the cabinets we took the chairs. The\n      cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me\n      employ. From the tables we removed the tops.\u201d\n\n      \u201cWhy so?\u201d\n\n      \u201cSometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece\n      of furniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an\n      article; then the leg is excavated, the article deposited within\n      the cavity, and the top replaced. The bottoms and tops of\n      bedposts are employed in the same way.\u201d\n\n      \u201cBut could not the cavity be detected by sounding?\u201d I asked.\n\n      \u201cBy no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient\n      wadding of cotton be placed around it. Besides, in our case, we\n      were obliged to proceed without noise.\u201d\n\n      \u201cBut you could not have removed\u2014you could not have taken to\n      pieces all articles of furniture in which it would have been\n      possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention. A letter\n      may be compressed into a thin spiral roll, not differing much in\n      shape or bulk from a large knitting-needle, and in this form it\n      might be inserted into the rung of a chair, for example. You did\n      not take to pieces all the chairs?\u201d\n\n      \u201cCertainly not; but we did better\u2014we examined the rungs of every\n      chair in the hotel, and, indeed the jointings of every\n      description of furniture, by the aid of a most powerful\n      microscope. Had there been any traces of recent disturbance we\n      should not have failed to detect it instantly. A single grain of\n      gimlet-dust, for example, would have been as obvious as an apple.\n      Any disorder in the glueing\u2014any unusual gaping in the\n      joints\u2014would have sufficed to insure detection.\u201d\n\n      \u201cI presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the\n      plates, and you probed the beds and the bed-clothes, as well as\n      the curtains and carpets.\u201d\n\n      \u201cThat of course; and when we had absolutely completed every\n      particle of the furniture in this way, then we examined the house\n      itself. We divided its entire surface into compartments, which we\n      numbered, so that none might be missed; then we scrutinized each\n      individual square inch throughout the premises, including the two\n      houses immediately adjoining, with the microscope, as before.\u201d\n\n      \u201cThe two houses adjoining!\u201d I exclaimed; \u201cyou must have had a\n      great deal of trouble.\u201d\n\n      \u201cWe had; but the reward offered is prodigious!\u201d\n\n      \u201cYou include the grounds about the houses?\u201d\n\n      \u201cAll the grounds are paved with brick. They gave us comparatively\n      little trouble. We examined the moss between the bricks, and\n      found it undisturbed.\u201d\n\n      \u201cYou looked among D\u2014\u2014\u2018s papers, of course, and into the books of\n      the library?\u201d\n\n      \u201cCertainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only\n      opened every book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume,\n      not contenting ourselves with a mere shake, according to the\n      fashion of some of our police officers. We also measured the\n      thickness of every book-cover, with the most accurate\n      admeasurement, and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of\n      the microscope. Had any of the bindings been recently meddled\n      with, it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should\n      have escaped observation. Some five or six volumes, just from the\n      hands of the binder, we carefully probed, longitudinally, with\n      the needles.\u201d\n\n      \u201cYou explored the floors beneath the carpets?\u201d\n\n      \u201cBeyond doubt. We removed every carpet, and examined the boards\n      with the microscope.\u201d\n\n      \u201cAnd the paper on the walls?\u201d\n\n      \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n      \u201cYou looked into the cellars?\u201d\n\n      \u201cWe did.\u201d\n\n      \u201cThen,\u201d I said, \u201cyou have been making a miscalculation, and the\n      letter is not upon the premises, as you suppose.\u201d\n\n      \u201cI fear you are right there,\u201d said the Prefect. \u201cAnd now, Dupin,\n      what would you advise me to do?\u201d\n\n      \u201cTo make a thorough re-search of the premises.\u201d\n\n      \u201cThat is absolutely needless,\u201d replied G\u2014\u2014. \u201cI am not more sure\n      that I breathe than I am that the letter is not at the Hotel.\u201d\n\n      \u201cI have no better advice to give you,\u201d said Dupin. \u201cYou have, of\n      course, an accurate description of the letter?\u201d\n\n      \u201cOh yes!\u201d\u2014And here the Prefect, producing a memorandum-book,\n      proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal, and\n      especially of the external appearance of the missing document.\n      Soon after finishing the perusal of this description, he took his\n      departure, more entirely depressed in spirits than I had ever\n      known the good gentleman before.\n\n      In about a month afterwards he paid us another visit, and found\n      us occupied very nearly as before. He took a pipe and a chair and\n      entered into some ordinary conversation. At length I said,\u2014\n\n      \u201cWell, but G\u2014\u2014, what of the purloined letter? I presume you have\n      at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as\n      overreaching the Minister?\u201d\n\n      \u201cConfound him, say I\u2014yes; I made the re-examination, however, as\n      Dupin suggested\u2014but it was all labor lost, as I knew it would\n      be.\u201d\n\n      \u201cHow much was the reward offered, did you say?\u201d asked Dupin.\n\n      \u201cWhy, a very great deal\u2014a very liberal reward\u2014I don\u2019t like to say\n      how much, precisely; but one thing I will say, that I wouldn\u2019t\n      mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any\n      one who could obtain me that letter. The fact is, it is becoming\n      of more and more importance every day; and the reward has been\n      lately doubled. If it were trebled, however, I could do no more\n      than I have done.\u201d\n\n      \u201cWhy, yes,\u201d said Dupin, drawlingly, between the whiffs of his\n      meerschaum, \u201cI really\u2014think, G\u2014\u2014, you have not exerted\n      yourself\u2014to the utmost in this matter. You might\u2014do a little\n      more, I think, eh?\u201d\n\n      \u201cHow?\u2014in what way?\u201d\n\n      \u201cWhy\u2014puff, puff\u2014you might\u2014puff, puff\u2014employ counsel in the\n      matter, eh?\u2014puff, puff, puff. Do you remember the story they tell\n      of Abernethy?\u201d\n\n      \u201cNo; hang Abernethy!\u201d\n\n      \u201cTo be sure! hang him and welcome. But, once upon a time, a\n      certain rich miser conceived the design of spunging upon this\n      Abernethy for a medical opinion. Getting up, for this purpose, an\n      ordinary conversation in a private company, he insinuated his\n      case to the physician, as that of an imaginary individual.\n\n      \u201c\u2018We will suppose,\u2019 said the miser, \u2018that his symptoms are such\n      and such; now, doctor, what would you have directed him to take?\u2019\n\n      \u201c\u2018Take!\u2019 said Abernethy, \u2018why, take advice, to be sure.\u2019\u201d\n\n      \u201cBut,\u201d said the Prefect, a little discomposed, \u201cI am perfectly\n      willing to take advice, and to pay for it. I would really give\n      fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter.\u201d\n\n      \u201cIn that case,\u201d replied Dupin, opening a drawer, and producing a\n      check-book, \u201cyou may as well fill me up a check for the amount\n      mentioned. When you have signed it, I will hand you the letter.\u201d\n\n      I was astounded. The Prefect appeared absolutely\n      thunder-stricken. For some minutes he remained speechless and\n      motionless, looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth,\n      and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets; then,\n      apparently recovering himself in some measure, he seized a pen,\n      and after several pauses and vacant stares, finally filled up and\n      signed a check for fifty thousand francs, and handed it across\n      the table to Dupin. The latter examined it carefully and\n      deposited it in his pocket-book; then, unlocking an escritoire,\n      took thence a letter and gave it to the Prefect. This functionary\n      grasped it in a perfect agony of joy, opened it with a trembling\n      hand, cast a rapid glance at its contents, and then, scrambling\n      and struggling to the door, rushed at length unceremoniously from\n      the room and from the house, without having uttered a syllable\n      since Dupin had requested him to fill up the check.\n\n      When he had gone, my friend entered into some explanations.\n\n      \u201cThe Parisian police,\u201d he said, \u201care exceedingly able in their\n      way. They are persevering, ingenious, cunning, and thoroughly\n      versed in the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to\n      demand. Thus, when G\u2014\u2014 detailed to us his mode of searching the\n      premises at the Hotel D\u2014\u2014, I felt entire confidence in his having\n      made a satisfactory investigation\u2014so far as his labors extended.\u201d\n\n      \u201cSo far as his labors extended?\u201d said I.\n\n      \u201cYes,\u201d said Dupin. \u201cThe measures adopted were not only the best\n      of their kind, but carried out to absolute perfection. Had the\n      letter been deposited within the range of their search, these\n      fellows would, beyond a question, have found it.\u201d\n\n      I merely laughed\u2014but he seemed quite serious in all that he said.\n\n      \u201cThe measures, then,\u201d he continued, \u201cwere good in their kind, and\n      well executed; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to\n      the case, and to the man. A certain set of highly ingenious\n      resources are, with the Prefect, a sort of Procrustean bed, to\n      which he forcibly adapts his designs. But he perpetually errs by\n      being too deep or too shallow for the matter in hand; and many a\n      schoolboy is a better reasoner than he. I knew one about eight\n      years of age, whose success at guessing in the game of \u2018even and\n      odd\u2019 attracted universal admiration. This game is simple, and is\n      played with marbles. One player holds in his hand a number of\n      these toys, and demands of another whether that number is even or\n      odd. If the guess is right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he\n      loses one. The boy to whom I allude won all the marbles of the\n      school. Of course he had some principle of guessing; and this lay\n      in mere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his\n      opponents. For example, an arrant simpleton is his opponent, and,\n      holding up his closed hand, asks, \u2018are they even or odd?\u2019 Our\n      schoolboy replies, \u2018odd,\u2019 and loses; but upon the second trial he\n      wins, for he then says to himself, \u2018the simpleton had them even\n      upon the first trial, and his amount of cunning is just\n      sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second; I will\n      therefore guess odd;\u2019\u2014he guesses odd, and wins. Now, with a\n      simpleton a degree above the first, he would have reasoned thus:\n      \u2018This fellow finds that in the first instance I guessed odd, and,\n      in the second, he will propose to himself, upon the first\n      impulse, a simple variation from even to odd, as did the first\n      simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that this is\n      too simple a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting\n      it even as before. I will therefore guess even;\u2019\u2014he guesses even,\n      and wins. Now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy, whom his\n      fellows termed \u2018lucky,\u2019\u2014what, in its last analysis, is it?\u201d\n\n      \u201cIt is merely,\u201d I said, \u201can identification of the reasoner\u2019s\n      intellect with that of his opponent.\u201d\n\n      \u201cIt is,\u201d said Dupin; \u201cand, upon inquiring of the boy by what\n      means he effected the thorough identification in which his\n      success consisted, I received answer as follows: \u2018When I wish to\n      find out how wise, or how stupid, or how good, or how wicked is\n      any one, or what are his thoughts at the moment, I fashion the\n      expression of my face, as accurately as possible, in accordance\n      with the expression of his, and then wait to see what thoughts or\n      sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or\n      correspond with the expression.\u2019 This response of the schoolboy\n      lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been\n      attributed to Rochefoucault, to La Bougive, to Machiavelli, and\n      to Campanella.\u201d\n\n      \u201cAnd the identification,\u201d I said, \u201cof the reasoner\u2019s intellect\n      with that of his opponent, depends, if I understand you aright,\n      upon the accuracy with which the opponent\u2019s intellect is\n      admeasured.\u201d\n\n      \u201cFor its practical value it depends upon this,\u201d replied Dupin;\n      \u201cand the Prefect and his cohort fail so frequently, first, by\n      default of this identification, and, secondly, by\n      ill-admeasurement, or rather through non-admeasurement, of the\n      intellect with which they are engaged. They consider only their\n      own ideas of ingenuity; and, in searching for anything hidden,\n      advert only to the modes in which they would have hidden it. They\n      are right in this much\u2014that their own ingenuity is a faithful\n      representative of that of the mass; but when the cunning of the\n      individual felon is diverse in character from their own, the\n      felon foils them, of course. This always happens when it is above\n      their own, and very usually when it is below. They have no\n      variation of principle in their investigations; at best, when\n      urged by some unusual emergency\u2014by some extraordinary reward\u2014they\n      extend or exaggerate their old modes of practice, without\n      touching their principles. What, for example, in this case of\n      D\u2014\u2014, has been done to vary the principle of action? What is all\n      this boring, and probing, and sounding, and scrutinizing with the\n      microscope and dividing the surface of the building into\n      registered square inches\u2014what is it all but an exaggeration of\n      the application of the one principle or set of principles of\n      search, which are based upon the one set of notions regarding\n      human ingenuity, to which the Prefect, in the long routine of his\n      duty, has been accustomed? Do you not see he has taken it for\n      granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter,\u2014not exactly in\n      a gimlet hole bored in a chair-leg\u2014but, at least, in some\n      out-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of\n      thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a\n      gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg? And do you not see also, that\n      such recherch\u00e9s nooks for concealment are adapted only for\n      ordinary occasions, and would be adopted only by ordinary\n      intellects; for, in all cases of concealment, a disposal of the\n      article concealed\u2014a disposal of it in this recherch\u00e9 manner,\u2014is,\n      in the very first instance, presumable and presumed; and thus its\n      discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogether\n      upon the mere care, patience, and determination of the seekers;\n      and where the case is of importance\u2014or, what amounts to the same\n      thing in the political eyes, when the reward is of magnitude,\u2014the\n      qualities in question have never been known to fail. You will now\n      understand what I meant in suggesting that, had the purloined\n      letter been hidden any where within the limits of the Prefect\u2019s\n      examination\u2014in other words, had the principle of its concealment\n      been comprehended within the principles of the Prefect\u2014its\n      discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question.\n      This functionary, however, has been thoroughly mystified; and the\n      remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the\n      Minister is a fool, because he has acquired renown as a poet. All\n      fools are poets; this the Prefect feels; and he is merely guilty\n      of a non distributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are\n      fools.\u201d\n\n      \u201cBut is this really the poet?\u201d I asked. \u201cThere are two brothers,\n      I know; and both have attained reputation in letters. The\n      Minister I believe has written learnedly on the Differential\n      Calculus. He is a mathematician, and no poet.\u201d\n\n      \u201cYou are mistaken; I know him well; he is both. As poet and\n      mathematician, he would reason well; as mere mathematician, he\n      could not have reasoned at all, and thus would have been at the\n      mercy of the Prefect.\u201d\n\n      \u201cYou surprise me,\u201d I said, \u201cby these opinions, which have been\n      contradicted by the voice of the world. You do not mean to set at\n      naught the well-digested idea of centuries. The mathematical\n      reason has long been regarded as the reason par excellence.\u201d\n\n      \u201c\u2018Il y a \u00e0 pari\u00e8r,\u2019\u201d replied Dupin, quoting from Chamfort, \u201c\u2018que\n      toute id\u00e9e publique, toute convention re\u00e7ue est une sottise, car\n      elle a convenue au plus grand nombre.\u2019 The mathematicians, I\n      grant you, have done their best to promulgate the popular error\n      to which you allude, and which is none the less an error for its\n      promulgation as truth. With an art worthy a better cause, for\n      example, they have insinuated the term \u2018analysis\u2019 into\n      application to algebra. The French are the originators of this\n      particular deception; but if a term is of any importance\u2014if words\n      derive any value from applicability\u2014then \u2018analysis\u2019 conveys\n      \u2018algebra\u2019 about as much as, in Latin, \u2018ambitus\u2019 implies\n      \u2018ambition,\u2019 \u2018_religio_\u2019 \u2018religion,\u2019 or \u2018_homines honesti_\u2019 a set\n      of _honorable_ men.\u201d\n\n      \u201cYou have a quarrel on hand, I see,\u201d said I, \u201cwith some of the\n      algebraists of Paris; but proceed.\u201d\n\n      \u201cI dispute the availability, and thus the value, of that reason\n      which is cultivated in any especial form other than the\n      abstractly logical. I dispute, in particular, the reason educed\n      by mathematical study. The mathematics are the science of form\n      and quantity; mathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to\n      observation upon form and quantity. The great error lies in\n      supposing that even the truths of what is called pure algebra,\n      are abstract or general truths. And this error is so egregious\n      that I am confounded at the universality with which it has been\n      received. Mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth.\n      What is true of relation\u2014of form and quantity\u2014is often grossly\n      false in regard to morals, for example. In this latter science it\n      is very usually untrue that the aggregated parts are equal to the\n      whole. In chemistry also the axiom fails. In the consideration of\n      motive it fails; for two motives, each of a given value, have\n      not, necessarily, a value when united, equal to the sum of their\n      values apart. There are numerous other mathematical truths which\n      are only truths within the limits of relation. But the\n      mathematician argues, from his finite truths, through habit, as\n      if they were of an absolutely general applicability\u2014as the world\n      indeed imagines them to be. Bryant, in his very learned\n      \u2018Mythology,\u2019 mentions an analogous source of error, when he says\n      that \u2018although the Pagan fables are not believed, yet we forget\n      ourselves continually, and make inferences from them as existing\n      realities.\u2019 With the algebraists, however, who are Pagans\n      themselves, the \u2018Pagan fables\u2019 are believed, and the inferences\n      are made, not so much through lapse of memory, as through an\n      unaccountable addling of the brains. In short, I never yet\n      encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of\n      equal roots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point\n      of his faith that x2+px was absolutely and unconditionally equal\n      to q. Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you\n      please, that you believe occasions may occur where x2+px is not\n      altogether equal to q, and, having made him understand what you\n      mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond\n      doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.\n\n      \u201cI mean to say,\u201d continued Dupin, while I merely laughed at his\n      last observations, \u201cthat if the Minister had been no more than a\n      mathematician, the Prefect would have been under no necessity of\n      giving me this check. I know him, however, as both mathematician\n      and poet, and my measures were adapted to his capacity, with\n      reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded. I knew\n      him as a courtier, too, and as a bold intriguant. Such a man, I\n      considered, could not fail to be aware of the ordinary policial\n      modes of action. He could not have failed to anticipate\u2014and\n      events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate\u2014the\n      waylayings to which he was subjected. He must have foreseen, I\n      reflected, the secret investigations of his premises. His\n      frequent absences from home at night, which were hailed by the\n      Prefect as certain aids to his success, I regarded only as ruses,\n      to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police, and thus\n      the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which G\u2014\u2014, in\n      fact, did finally arrive\u2014the conviction that the letter was not\n      upon the premises. I felt, also, that the whole train of thought,\n      which I was at some pains in detailing to you just now,\n      concerning the invariable principle of policial action in\n      searches for articles concealed\u2014I felt that this whole train of\n      thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the Minister.\n      It would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary nooks\n      of concealment. He could not, I reflected, be so weak as not to\n      see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would\n      be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the probes,\n      to the gimlets, and to the microscopes of the Prefect. I saw, in\n      fine, that he would be driven, as a matter of course, to\n      simplicity, if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of\n      choice. You will remember, perhaps, how desperately the Prefect\n      laughed when I suggested, upon our first interview, that it was\n      just possible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its\n      being so very self-evident.\u201d\n\n      \u201cYes,\u201d said I, \u201cI remember his merriment well. I really thought\n      he would have fallen into convulsions.\u201d\n\n      \u201cThe material world,\u201d continued Dupin, \u201cabounds with very strict\n      analogies to the immaterial; and thus some color of truth has\n      been given to the rhetorical dogma, that metaphor, or simile, may\n      be made to strengthen an argument, as well as to embellish a\n      description. The principle of the vis inerti\u00e6, for example, seems\n      to be identical in physics and metaphysics. It is not more true\n      in the former, that a large body is with more difficulty set in\n      motion than a smaller one, and that its subsequent momentum is\n      commensurate with this difficulty, than it is, in the latter,\n      that intellects of the vaster capacity, while more forcible, more\n      constant, and more eventful in their movements than those of\n      inferior grade, are yet the less readily moved, and more\n      embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few steps of\n      their progress. Again: have you ever noticed which of the street\n      signs, over the shop-doors, are the most attractive of\n      attention?\u201d\n\n      \u201cI have never given the matter a thought,\u201d I said.\n\n      \u201cThere is a game of puzzles,\u201d he resumed, \u201cwhich is played upon a\n      map. One party playing requires another to find a given word\u2014the\n      name of town, river, state or empire\u2014any word, in short, upon the\n      motley and perplexed surface of the chart. A novice in the game\n      generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the\n      most minutely lettered names; but the adept selects such words as\n      stretch, in large characters, from one end of the chart to the\n      other. These, like the over-largely lettered signs and placards\n      of the street, escape observation by dint of being excessively\n      obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous\n      with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to\n      pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and\n      too palpably self-evident. But this is a point, it appears,\n      somewhat above or beneath the understanding of the Prefect. He\n      never once thought it probable, or possible, that the Minister\n      had deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the\n      whole world, by way of best preventing any portion of that world\n      from perceiving it.\n\n      \u201cBut the more I reflected upon the daring, dashing, and\n      discriminating ingenuity of D\u2014\u2014; upon the fact that the document\n      must always have been at hand, if he intended to use it to good\n      purpose; and upon the decisive evidence, obtained by the Prefect,\n      that it was not hidden within the limits of that dignitary\u2019s\n      ordinary search\u2014the more satisfied I became that, to conceal this\n      letter, the Minister had resorted to the comprehensive and\n      sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all.\n\n      \u201cFull of these ideas, I prepared myself with a pair of green\n      spectacles, and called one fine morning, quite by accident, at\n      the Ministerial hotel. I found D\u2014\u2014 at home, yawning, lounging,\n      and dawdling, as usual, and pretending to be in the last\n      extremity of ennui. He is, perhaps, the most really energetic\n      human being now alive\u2014but that is only when nobody sees him.\n\n      \u201cTo be even with him, I complained of my weak eyes, and lamented\n      the necessity of the spectacles, under cover of which I\n      cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment, while\n      seemingly intent only upon the conversation of my host.\n\n      \u201cI paid especial attention to a large writing-table near which he\n      sat, and upon which lay confusedly, some miscellaneous letters\n      and other papers, with one or two musical instruments and a few\n      books. Here, however, after a long and very deliberate scrutiny,\n      I saw nothing to excite particular suspicion.\n\n      \u201cAt length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon a\n      trumpery fillagree card-rack of pasteboard, that hung dangling by\n      a dirty blue ribbon, from a little brass knob just beneath the\n      middle of the mantel-piece. In this rack, which had three or four\n      compartments, were five or six visiting cards and a solitary\n      letter. This last was much soiled and crumpled. It was torn\n      nearly in two, across the middle\u2014as if a design, in the first\n      instance, to tear it entirely up as worthless, had been altered,\n      or stayed, in the second. It had a large black seal, bearing the\n      D\u2014\u2014 cipher _very_ conspicuously, and was addressed, in a\n      diminutive female hand, to D\u2014\u2014, the minister, himself. It was\n      thrust carelessly, and even, as it seemed, contemptuously, into\n      one of the uppermost divisions of the rack.\n\n      \u201cNo sooner had I glanced at this letter, than I concluded it to\n      be that of which I was in search. To be sure, it was, to all\n      appearance, radically different from the one of which the Prefect\n      had read us so minute a description. Here the seal was large and\n      black, with the D\u2014\u2014 cipher; there it was small and red, with the\n      ducal arms of the S\u2014\u2014 family. Here, the address, to the Minister,\n      diminutive and feminine; there the superscription, to a certain\n      royal personage, was markedly bold and decided; the size alone\n      formed a point of correspondence. But, then, the radicalness of\n      these differences, which was excessive; the dirt; the soiled and\n      torn condition of the paper, so inconsistent with the true\n      methodical habits of D\u2014\u2014, and so suggestive of a design to delude\n      the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the\n      document\u2014these things, together with the hyper-obtrusive\n      situation of this document, full in the view of every visitor,\n      and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which I\n      had previously arrived; these things, I say, were strongly\n      corroborative of suspicion, in one who came with the intention to\n      suspect.\n\n      \u201cI protracted my visit as long as possible, and, while I\n      maintained a most animated discussion with the Minister upon a\n      topic which I knew well had never failed to interest and excite\n      him, I kept my attention really riveted upon the letter. In this\n      examination, I committed to memory its external appearance and\n      arrangement in the rack; and also fell, at length, upon a\n      discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt I might have\n      entertained. In scrutinizing the edges of the paper, I observed\n      them to be more chafed than seemed necessary. They presented the\n      broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper, having\n      been once folded and pressed with a folder, is refolded in a\n      reversed direction, in the same creases or edges which had formed\n      the original fold. This discovery was sufficient. It was clear to\n      me that the letter had been turned, as a glove, inside out,\n      re-directed, and re-sealed. I bade the Minister good morning, and\n      took my departure at once, leaving a gold snuff-box upon the\n      table.\n\n      \u201cThe next morning I called for the snuff-box, when we resumed,\n      quite eagerly, the conversation of the preceding day. While thus\n      engaged, however, a loud report, as if of a pistol, was heard\n      immediately beneath the windows of the hotel, and was succeeded\n      by a series of fearful screams, and the shoutings of a terrified\n      mob. D\u2014\u2014 rushed to a casement, threw it open, and looked out. In\n      the meantime, I stepped to the card-rack, took the letter, put it\n      in my pocket, and replaced it by a fac-simile, (so far as regards\n      externals,) which I had carefully prepared at my\n      lodgings\u2014imitating the D\u2014\u2014 cipher, very readily, by means of a\n      seal formed of bread.\n\n      \u201cThe disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic\n      behavior of a man with a musket. He had fired it among a crowd of\n      women and children. It proved, however, to have been without\n      ball, and the fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a\n      drunkard. When he had gone, D\u2014\u2014 came from the window, whither I\n      had followed him immediately upon securing the object in view.\n      Soon afterwards I bade him farewell. The pretended lunatic was a\n      man in my own pay.\u201d\n\n      \u201cBut what purpose had you,\u201d I asked, \u201cin replacing the letter by\n      a fac-simile? Would it not have been better, at the first visit,\n      to have seized it openly, and departed?\u201d\n\n      \u201cD\u2014\u2014,\u201d replied Dupin, \u201cis a desperate man, and a man of nerve.\n      His hotel, too, is not without attendants devoted to his\n      interests. Had I made the wild attempt you suggest, I might never\n      have left the Ministerial presence alive. The good people of\n      Paris might have heard of me no more. But I had an object apart\n      from these considerations. You know my political prepossessions.\n      In this matter, I act as a partisan of the lady concerned. For\n      eighteen months the Minister has had her in his power. She has\n      now him in hers\u2014since, being unaware that the letter is not in\n      his possession, he will proceed with his exactions as if it was.\n      Thus will he inevitably commit himself, at once, to his political\n      destruction. His downfall, too, will not be more precipitate than\n      awkward. It is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus\n      Averni; but in all kinds of climbing, as Catalani said of\n      singing, it is far more easy to get up than to come down. In the\n      present instance I have no sympathy\u2014at least no pity\u2014for him who\n      descends. He is that monstrum horrendum, an unprincipled man of\n      genius. I confess, however, that I should like very well to know\n      the precise character of his thoughts, when, being defied by her\n      whom the Prefect terms \u2018a certain personage\u2019 he is reduced to\n      opening the letter which I left for him in the card-rack.\u201d\n\n      \u201cHow? did you put any thing particular in it?\u201d\n\n      \u201cWhy\u2014it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior\n      blank\u2014that would have been insulting. D\u2014\u2014, at Vienna once, did me\n      an evil turn, which I told him, quite good-humoredly, that I\n      should remember. So, as I knew he would feel some curiosity in\n      regard to the identity of the person who had outwitted him, I\n      thought it a pity not to give him a clue. He is well acquainted\n      with my MS., and I just copied into the middle of the blank sheet\n      the words\u2014\n\n      \u201c\u2018\u2014 \u2014 Un dessein si funeste,\n      S\u2019il n\u2019est digne d\u2019Atr\u00e9e, est digne de Thyeste.\n\n      They are to be found in Cr\u00e9billon\u2019s \u2018Atr\u00e9e.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\nTHE THOUSAND-AND-SECOND TALE OF SCHEHERAZADE\n\n\nTruth is stranger than fiction.\u2014_Old Saying_\n\n      Having had occasion, lately, in the course of some Oriental\n      investigations, to consult the Tellmenow Isits\u00f6ornot, a work\n      which (like the Zohar of Simeon Jochaides) is scarcely known at\n      all, even in Europe; and which has never been quoted, to my\n      knowledge, by any American\u2014if we except, perhaps, the author of\n      the \u201cCuriosities of American Literature\u201d;\u2014having had occasion, I\n      say, to turn over some pages of the first-mentioned very\n      remarkable work, I was not a little astonished to discover that\n      the literary world has hitherto been strangely in error\n      respecting the fate of the vizier\u2019s daughter, Scheherazade, as\n      that fate is depicted in the \u201cArabian Nights\u201d; and that the\n      _d\u00e9nouement_ there given, if not altogether inaccurate, as far as\n      it goes, is at least to blame in not having gone very much\n      farther.\n\n      For full information on this interesting topic, I must refer the\n      inquisitive reader to the \u201cIsits\u00f6ornot\u201d itself; but in the\n      meantime, I shall be pardoned for giving a summary of what I\n      there discovered.\n\n      It will be remembered, that, in the usual version of the tales, a\n      certain monarch having good cause to be jealous of his queen, not\n      only puts her to death, but makes a vow, by his beard and the\n      prophet, to espouse each night the most beautiful maiden in his\n      dominions, and the next morning to deliver her up to the\n      executioner.\n\n      Having fulfilled this vow for many years to the letter, and with\n      a religious punctuality and method that conferred great credit\n      upon him as a man of devout feeling and excellent sense, he was\n      interrupted one afternoon (no doubt at his prayers) by a visit\n      from his grand vizier, to whose daughter, it appears, there had\n      occurred an idea.\n\n      Her name was Scheherazade, and her idea was, that she would\n      either redeem the land from the depopulating tax upon its beauty,\n      or perish, after the approved fashion of all heroines, in the\n      attempt.\n\n      Accordingly, and although we do not find it to be leap-year\n      (which makes the sacrifice more meritorious), she deputes her\n      father, the grand vizier, to make an offer to the king of her\n      hand. This hand the king eagerly accepts\u2014(he had intended to take\n      it at all events, and had put off the matter from day to day,\n      only through fear of the vizier),\u2014but, in accepting it now, he\n      gives all parties very distinctly to understand, that, grand\n      vizier or no grand vizier, he has not the slightest design of\n      giving up one iota of his vow or of his privileges. When,\n      therefore, the fair Scheherazade insisted upon marrying the king,\n      and did actually marry him despite her father\u2019s excellent advice\n      not to do any thing of the kind\u2014when she would and did marry him,\n      I say, will I, nill I, it was with her beautiful black eyes as\n      thoroughly open as the nature of the case would allow.\n\n      It seems, however, that this politic damsel (who had been reading\n      Machiavelli, beyond doubt), had a very ingenious little plot in\n      her mind. On the night of the wedding, she contrived, upon I\n      forget what specious pretence, to have her sister occupy a couch\n      sufficiently near that of the royal pair to admit of easy\n      conversation from bed to bed; and, a little before cock-crowing,\n      she took care to awaken the good monarch, her husband (who bore\n      her none the worse will because he intended to wring her neck on\n      the morrow),\u2014she managed to awaken him, I say, (although on\n      account of a capital conscience and an easy digestion, he slept\n      well) by the profound interest of a story (about a rat and a\n      black cat, I think) which she was narrating (all in an undertone,\n      of course) to her sister. When the day broke, it so happened that\n      this history was not altogether finished, and that Scheherazade,\n      in the nature of things could not finish it just then, since it\n      was high time for her to get up and be bowstrung\u2014a thing very\n      little more pleasant than hanging, only a trifle more genteel!\n\n      The king\u2019s curiosity, however, prevailing, I am sorry to say,\n      even over his sound religious principles, induced him for this\n      once to postpone the fulfilment of his vow until next morning,\n      for the purpose and with the hope of hearing that night how it\n      fared in the end with the black cat (a black cat, I think it was)\n      and the rat.\n\n      The night having arrived, however, the lady Scheherazade not only\n      put the finishing stroke to the black cat and the rat (the rat\n      was blue) but before she well knew what she was about, found\n      herself deep in the intricacies of a narration, having reference\n      (if I am not altogether mistaken) to a pink horse (with green\n      wings) that went, in a violent manner, by clockwork, and was\n      wound up with an indigo key. With this history the king was even\n      more profoundly interested than with the other\u2014and, as the day\n      broke before its conclusion (notwithstanding all the queen\u2019s\n      endeavors to get through with it in time for the bowstringing),\n      there was again no resource but to postpone that ceremony as\n      before, for twenty-four hours. The next night there happened a\n      similar accident with a similar result; and then the next\u2014and\n      then again the next; so that, in the end, the good monarch,\n      having been unavoidably deprived of all opportunity to keep his\n      vow during a period of no less than one thousand and one nights,\n      either forgets it altogether by the expiration of this time, or\n      gets himself absolved of it in the regular way, or (what is more\n      probable) breaks it outright, as well as the head of his father\n      confessor. At all events, Scheherazade, who, being lineally\n      descended from Eve, fell heir, perhaps, to the whole seven\n      baskets of talk, which the latter lady, we all know, picked up\n      from under the trees in the garden of Eden; Scheherazade, I say,\n      finally triumphed, and the tariff upon beauty was repealed.\n\n      Now, this conclusion (which is that of the story as we have it\n      upon record) is, no doubt, excessively proper and pleasant\u2014but\n      alas! like a great many pleasant things, is more pleasant than\n      true, and I am indebted altogether to the \u201cIsits\u00f6ornot\u201d for the\n      means of correcting the error. \u201cLe mieux,\u201d says a French proverb,\n      \u201cest l\u2019ennemi du bien,\u201d and, in mentioning that Scheherazade had\n      inherited the seven baskets of talk, I should have added that she\n      put them out at compound interest until they amounted to\n      seventy-seven.\n\n      \u201cMy dear sister,\u201d said she, on the thousand-and-second night, (I\n      quote the language of the \u201cIsits\u00f6ornot\u201d at this point, verbatim)\n      \u201cmy dear sister,\u201d said she, \u201cnow that all this little difficulty\n      about the bowstring has blown over, and that this odious tax is\n      so happily repealed, I feel that I have been guilty of great\n      indiscretion in withholding from you and the king (who I am sorry\n      to say, snores\u2014a thing no gentleman would do) the full conclusion\n      of Sinbad the sailor. This person went through numerous other and\n      more interesting adventures than those which I related; but the\n      truth is, I felt sleepy on the particular night of their\n      narration, and so was seduced into cutting them short\u2014a grievous\n      piece of misconduct, for which I only trust that Allah will\n      forgive me. But even yet it is not too late to remedy my great\n      neglect\u2014and as soon as I have given the king a pinch or two in\n      order to wake him up so far that he may stop making that horrible\n      noise, I will forthwith entertain you (and him if he pleases)\n      with the sequel of this very remarkable story.\u201d\n\n      Hereupon the sister of Scheherazade, as I have it from the\n      \u201cIsits\u00f6ornot,\u201d expressed no very particular intensity of\n      gratification; but the king, having been sufficiently pinched, at\n      length ceased snoring, and finally said, \u201cHum!\u201d and then \u201cHoo!\u201d\n      when the queen, understanding these words (which are no doubt\n      Arabic) to signify that he was all attention, and would do his\n      best not to snore any more\u2014the queen, I say, having arranged\n      these matters to her satisfaction, re-entered thus, at once, into\n      the history of Sinbad the sailor:\n\n      \u201c\u2018At length, in my old age,\u2019 [these are the words of Sinbad\n      himself, as retailed by Scheherazade]\u2014\u2018at length, in my old age,\n      and after enjoying many years of tranquillity at home, I became\n      once more possessed of a desire of visiting foreign countries;\n      and one day, without acquainting any of my family with my design,\n      I packed up some bundles of such merchandise as was most precious\n      and least bulky, and, engaging a porter to carry them, went with\n      him down to the sea-shore, to await the arrival of any chance\n      vessel that might convey me out of the kingdom into some region\n      which I had not as yet explored.\n\n      \u201c\u2018Having deposited the packages upon the sands, we sat down\n      beneath some trees, and looked out into the ocean in the hope of\n      perceiving a ship, but during several hours we saw none whatever.\n      At length I fancied that I could hear a singular buzzing or\n      humming sound; and the porter, after listening awhile, declared\n      that he also could distinguish it. Presently it grew louder, and\n      then still louder, so that we could have no doubt that the object\n      which caused it was approaching us. At length, on the edge of the\n      horizon, we discovered a black speck, which rapidly increased in\n      size until we made it out to be a vast monster, swimming with a\n      great part of its body above the surface of the sea. It came\n      toward us with inconceivable swiftness, throwing up huge waves of\n      foam around its breast, and illuminating all that part of the sea\n      through which it passed, with a long line of fire that extended\n      far off into the distance.\n\n      \u201c\u2018As the thing drew near we saw it very distinctly. Its length\n      was equal to that of three of the loftiest trees that grow, and\n      it was as wide as the great hall of audience in your palace, O\n      most sublime and munificent of the Caliphs. Its body, which was\n      unlike that of ordinary fishes, was as solid as a rock, and of a\n      jetty blackness throughout all that portion of it which floated\n      above the water, with the exception of a narrow blood-red streak\n      that completely begirdled it. The belly, which floated beneath\n      the surface, and of which we could get only a glimpse now and\n      then as the monster rose and fell with the billows, was entirely\n      covered with metallic scales, of a color like that of the moon in\n      misty weather. The back was flat and nearly white, and from it\n      there extended upwards of six spines, about half the length of\n      the whole body.\n\n      \u201c\u2018This horrible creature had no mouth that we could perceive;\n      but, as if to make up for this deficiency, it was provided with\n      at least four score of eyes, that protruded from their sockets\n      like those of the green dragon-fly, and were arranged all around\n      the body in two rows, one above the other, and parallel to the\n      blood-red streak, which seemed to answer the purpose of an\n      eyebrow. Two or three of these dreadful eyes were much larger\n      than the others, and had the appearance of solid gold.\n\n      \u201c\u2018Although this beast approached us, as I have before said, with\n      the greatest rapidity, it must have been moved altogether by\n      necromancy\u2014for it had neither fins like a fish nor web-feet like\n      a duck, nor wings like the seashell which is blown along in the\n      manner of a vessel; nor yet did it writhe itself forward as do\n      the eels. Its head and its tail were shaped precisely alike,\n      only, not far from the latter, were two small holes that served\n      for nostrils, and through which the monster puffed out its thick\n      breath with prodigious violence, and with a shrieking,\n      disagreeable noise.\n\n      \u201c\u2018Our terror at beholding this hideous thing was very great, but\n      it was even surpassed by our astonishment, when upon getting a\n      nearer look, we perceived upon the creature\u2019s back a vast number\n      of animals about the size and shape of men, and altogether much\n      resembling them, except that they wore no garments (as men do),\n      being supplied (by nature, no doubt) with an ugly uncomfortable\n      covering, a good deal like cloth, but fitting so tight to the\n      skin, as to render the poor wretches laughably awkward, and put\n      them apparently to severe pain. On the very tips of their heads\n      were certain square-looking boxes, which, at first sight, I\n      thought might have been intended to answer as turbans, but I soon\n      discovered that they were excessively heavy and solid, and I\n      therefore concluded they were contrivances designed, by their\n      great weight, to keep the heads of the animals steady and safe\n      upon their shoulders. Around the necks of the creatures were\n      fastened black collars, (badges of servitude, no doubt,) such as\n      we keep on our dogs, only much wider and infinitely stiffer, so\n      that it was quite impossible for these poor victims to move their\n      heads in any direction without moving the body at the same time;\n      and thus they were doomed to perpetual contemplation of their\n      noses\u2014a view puggish and snubby in a wonderful, if not positively\n      in an awful degree.\n\n      \u201c\u2018When the monster had nearly reached the shore where we stood,\n      it suddenly pushed out one of its eyes to a great extent, and\n      emitted from it a terrible flash of fire, accompanied by a dense\n      cloud of smoke, and a noise that I can compare to nothing but\n      thunder. As the smoke cleared away, we saw one of the odd\n      man-animals standing near the head of the large beast with a\n      trumpet in his hand, through which (putting it to his mouth) he\n      presently addressed us in loud, harsh, and disagreeable accents,\n      that, perhaps, we should have mistaken for language, had they not\n      come altogether through the nose.\n\n      \u201c\u2018Being thus evidently spoken to, I was at a loss how to reply,\n      as I could in no manner understand what was said; and in this\n      difficulty I turned to the porter, who was near swooning through\n      affright, and demanded of him his opinion as to what species of\n      monster it was, what it wanted, and what kind of creatures those\n      were that so swarmed upon its back. To this the porter replied,\n      as well as he could for trepidation, that he had once before\n      heard of this sea-beast; that it was a cruel demon, with bowels\n      of sulphur and blood of fire, created by evil genii as the means\n      of inflicting misery upon mankind; that the things upon its back\n      were vermin, such as sometimes infest cats and dogs, only a\n      little larger and more savage; and that these vermin had their\n      uses, however evil\u2014for, through the torture they caused the beast\n      by their nibbling and stingings, it was goaded into that degree\n      of wrath which was requisite to make it roar and commit ill, and\n      so fulfil the vengeful and malicious designs of the wicked genii.\n\n      \u201cThis account determined me to take to my heels, and, without\n      once even looking behind me, I ran at full speed up into the\n      hills, while the porter ran equally fast, although nearly in an\n      opposite direction, so that, by these means, he finally made his\n      escape with my bundles, of which I have no doubt he took\n      excellent care\u2014although this is a point I cannot determine, as I\n      do not remember that I ever beheld him again.\n\n      \u201c\u2018For myself, I was so hotly pursued by a swarm of the men-vermin\n      (who had come to the shore in boats) that I was very soon\n      overtaken, bound hand and foot, and conveyed to the beast, which\n      immediately swam out again into the middle of the sea.\n\n      \u201c\u2018I now bitterly repented my folly in quitting a comfortable home\n      to peril my life in such adventures as this; but regret being\n      useless, I made the best of my condition, and exerted myself to\n      secure the goodwill of the man-animal that owned the trumpet, and\n      who appeared to exercise authority over his fellows. I succeeded\n      so well in this endeavor that, in a few days, the creature\n      bestowed upon me various tokens of his favor, and in the end even\n      went to the trouble of teaching me the rudiments of what it was\n      vain enough to denominate its language; so that, at length, I was\n      enabled to converse with it readily, and came to make it\n      comprehend the ardent desire I had of seeing the world.\n\n      \u201c\u2018Washish squashish squeak, Sinbad, hey-diddle diddle, grunt unt\n      grumble, hiss, fiss, whiss,\u2019 said he to me, one day after\n      dinner\u2014but I beg a thousand pardons, I had forgotten that your\n      majesty is not conversant with the dialect of the Cock-neighs (so\n      the man-animals were called; I presume because their language\n      formed the connecting link between that of the horse and that of\n      the rooster). With your permission, I will translate. \u2018Washish\n      squashish,\u2019 and so forth:\u2014that is to say, \u2018I am happy to find, my\n      dear Sinbad, that you are really a very excellent fellow; we are\n      now about doing a thing which is called circumnavigating the\n      globe; and since you are so desirous of seeing the world, I will\n      strain a point and give you a free passage upon back of the\n      beast.\u2019\u201d\n\n      When the Lady Scheherazade had proceeded thus far, relates the\n      \u201cIsits\u00f6ornot,\u201d the king turned over from his left side to his\n      right, and said:\n\n      \u201cIt is, in fact, very surprising, my dear queen, that you\n      omitted, hitherto, these latter adventures of Sinbad. Do you know\n      I think them exceedingly entertaining and strange?\u201d\n\n      The king having thus expressed himself, we are told, the fair\n      Scheherazade resumed her history in the following words:\n\n      \u201cSinbad went on in this manner with his narrative\u2014\u2018I thanked the\n      man-animal for its kindness, and soon found myself very much at\n      home on the beast, which swam at a prodigious rate through the\n      ocean; although the surface of the latter is, in that part of the\n      world, by no means flat, but round like a pomegranate, so that we\n      went\u2014so to say\u2014either up hill or down hill all the time.\u2019\n\n      \u201cThat I think, was very singular,\u201d interrupted the king.\n\n      \u201cNevertheless, it is quite true,\u201d replied Scheherazade.\n\n      \u201cI have my doubts,\u201d rejoined the king; \u201cbut, pray, be so good as\n      to go on with the story.\u201d\n\n      \u201cI will,\u201d said the queen. \u201c\u2018The beast,\u2019 continued Sinbad to the\n      caliph, \u2018swam, as I have related, up hill and down hill until, at\n      length, we arrived at an island, many hundreds of miles in\n      circumference, but which, nevertheless, had been built in the\n      middle of the sea by a colony of little things like\n      caterpillars.\u2019\u201d (*1)\n\n      \u201cHum!\u201d said the king.\n\n      \u201c\u2018Leaving this island,\u2019 said Sinbad\u2014(for Scheherazade, it must be\n      understood, took no notice of her husband\u2019s ill-mannered\n      ejaculation) \u2018leaving this island, we came to another where the\n      forests were of solid stone, and so hard that they shivered to\n      pieces the finest-tempered axes with which we endeavoured to cut\n      them down.\u2019\u201d (*2)\n\n      \u201cHum!\u201d said the king, again; but Scheherazade, paying him no\n      attention, continued in the language of Sinbad.\n\n      \u201c\u2018Passing beyond this last island, we reached a country where\n      there was a cave that ran to the distance of thirty or forty\n      miles within the bowels of the earth, and that contained a\n      greater number of far more spacious and more magnificent palaces\n      than are to be found in all Damascus and Bagdad. From the roofs\n      of these palaces there hung myriads of gems, like diamonds, but\n      larger than men; and in among the streets of towers and pyramids\n      and temples, there flowed immense rivers as black as ebony, and\n      swarming with fish that had no eyes.\u2019\u201d (*3)\n\n      \u201cHum!\u201d said the king.\n\n      \u201c\u2018We then swam into a region of the sea where we found a lofty\n      mountain, down whose sides there streamed torrents of melted\n      metal, some of which were twelve miles wide and sixty miles long\n      (*4); while from an abyss on the summit, issued so vast a\n      quantity of ashes that the sun was entirely blotted out from the\n      heavens, and it became darker than the darkest midnight; so that\n      when we were even at the distance of a hundred and fifty miles\n      from the mountain, it was impossible to see the whitest object,\n      however close we held it to our eyes.\u2019\u201d (*5)\n\n      \u201cHum!\u201d said the king.\n\n      \u201c\u2018After quitting this coast, the beast continued his voyage until\n      we met with a land in which the nature of things seemed\n      reversed\u2014for we here saw a great lake, at the bottom of which,\n      more than a hundred feet beneath the surface of the water, there\n      flourished in full leaf a forest of tall and luxuriant trees.\u2019\u201d\n      (*6)\n\n      \u201cHoo!\u201d said the king.\n\n      \u201cSome hundred miles farther on brought us to a climate where the\n      atmosphere was so dense as to sustain iron or steel, just as our\n      own does feather.\u2019\u201d (*7)\n\n      \u201cFiddle de dee,\u201d said the king.\n\n      \u201cProceeding still in the same direction, we presently arrived at\n      the most magnificent region in the whole world. Through it there\n      meandered a glorious river for several thousands of miles. This\n      river was of unspeakable depth, and of a transparency richer than\n      that of amber. It was from three to six miles in width; and its\n      banks which arose on either side to twelve hundred feet in\n      perpendicular height, were crowned with ever-blossoming trees and\n      perpetual sweet-scented flowers, that made the whole territory\n      one gorgeous garden; but the name of this luxuriant land was the\n      Kingdom of Horror, and to enter it was inevitable death.\u2019\u201d (*8)\n\n      \u201cHumph!\u201d said the king.\n\n      \u201c\u2018We left this kingdom in great haste, and, after some days, came\n      to another, where we were astonished to perceive myriads of\n      monstrous animals with horns resembling scythes upon their heads.\n      These hideous beasts dig for themselves vast caverns in the soil,\n      of a funnel shape, and line the sides of them with rocks, so\n      disposed one upon the other that they fall instantly, when\n      trodden upon by other animals, thus precipitating them into the\n      monster\u2019s dens, where their blood is immediately sucked, and\n      their carcasses afterwards hurled contemptuously out to an\n      immense distance from \u201cthe caverns of death.\"\u2019\u201d (*9)\n\n      \u201cPooh!\u201d said the king.\n\n      \u201c\u2018Continuing our progress, we perceived a district with\n      vegetables that grew not upon any soil but in the air. (*10)\n      There were others that sprang from the substance of other\n      vegetables; (*11) others that derived their substance from the\n      bodies of living animals; (*12) and then again, there were others\n      that glowed all over with intense fire; (*13) others that moved\n      from place to place at pleasure, (*14) and what was still more\n      wonderful, we discovered flowers that lived and breathed and\n      moved their limbs at will and had, moreover, the detestable\n      passion of mankind for enslaving other creatures, and confining\n      them in horrid and solitary prisons until the fulfillment of\n      appointed tasks.\u2019\u201d (*15)\n\n      \u201cPshaw!\u201d said the king.\n\n      \u201c\u2018Quitting this land, we soon arrived at another in which the\n      bees and the birds are mathematicians of such genius and\n      erudition, that they give daily instructions in the science of\n      geometry to the wise men of the empire. The king of the place\n      having offered a reward for the solution of two very difficult\n      problems, they were solved upon the spot\u2014the one by the bees, and\n      the other by the birds; but the king keeping their solution a\n      secret, it was only after the most profound researches and labor,\n      and the writing of an infinity of big books, during a long series\n      of years, that the men-mathematicians at length arrived at the\n      identical solutions which had been given upon the spot by the\n      bees and by the birds.\u2019\u201d (*16)\n\n      \u201cOh my!\u201d said the king.\n\n      \u201c\u2018We had scarcely lost sight of this empire when we found\n      ourselves close upon another, from whose shores there flew over\n      our heads a flock of fowls a mile in breadth, and two hundred and\n      forty miles long; so that, although they flew a mile during every\n      minute, it required no less than four hours for the whole flock\n      to pass over us\u2014in which there were several millions of millions\n      of fowl.\u2019\u201d (*17)\n\n      \u201cOh fy!\u201d said the king.\n\n      \u201c\u2018No sooner had we got rid of these birds, which occasioned us\n      great annoyance, than we were terrified by the appearance of a\n      fowl of another kind, and infinitely larger than even the rocs\n      which I met in my former voyages; for it was bigger than the\n      biggest of the domes on your seraglio, oh, most Munificent of\n      Caliphs. This terrible fowl had no head that we could perceive,\n      but was fashioned entirely of belly, which was of a prodigious\n      fatness and roundness, of a soft-looking substance, smooth,\n      shining and striped with various colors. In its talons, the\n      monster was bearing away to his eyrie in the heavens, a house\n      from which it had knocked off the roof, and in the interior of\n      which we distinctly saw human beings, who, beyond doubt, were in\n      a state of frightful despair at the horrible fate which awaited\n      them. We shouted with all our might, in the hope of frightening\n      the bird into letting go of its prey, but it merely gave a snort\n      or puff, as if of rage and then let fall upon our heads a heavy\n      sack which proved to be filled with sand!\u2019\u201d\n\n      \u201cStuff!\u201d said the king.\n\n      \u201c\u2018It was just after this adventure that we encountered a\n      continent of immense extent and prodigious solidity, but which,\n      nevertheless, was supported entirely upon the back of a sky-blue\n      cow that had no fewer than four hundred horns.\u2019\u201d (*18)\n\n      \u201cThat, now, I believe,\u201d said the king, \u201cbecause I have read\n      something of the kind before, in a book.\u201d\n\n      \u201c\u2018We passed immediately beneath this continent, (swimming in\n      between the legs of the cow), and, after some hours, found\n      ourselves in a wonderful country indeed, which, I was informed by\n      the man-animal, was his own native land, inhabited by things of\n      his own species. This elevated the man-animal very much in my\n      esteem, and in fact, I now began to feel ashamed of the\n      contemptuous familiarity with which I had treated him; for I\n      found that the man-animals in general were a nation of the most\n      powerful magicians, who lived with worms in their brain, (*19)\n      which, no doubt, served to stimulate them by their painful\n      writhings and wrigglings to the most miraculous efforts of\n      imagination!\u2019\u201d\n\n      \u201cNonsense!\u201d said the king.\n\n      \u201c\u2018Among the magicians, were domesticated several animals of very\n      singular kinds; for example, there was a huge horse whose bones\n      were iron and whose blood was boiling water. In place of corn, he\n      had black stones for his usual food; and yet, in spite of so hard\n      a diet, he was so strong and swift that he would drag a load more\n      weighty than the grandest temple in this city, at a rate\n      surpassing that of the flight of most birds.\u2019\u201d (*20)\n\n      \u201cTwattle!\u201d said the king.\n\n      \u201c\u2018I saw, also, among these people a hen without feathers, but\n      bigger than a camel; instead of flesh and bone she had iron and\n      brick; her blood, like that of the horse, (to whom, in fact, she\n      was nearly related,) was boiling water; and like him she ate\n      nothing but wood or black stones. This hen brought forth very\n      frequently, a hundred chickens in the day; and, after birth, they\n      took up their residence for several weeks within the stomach of\n      their mother.\u2019\u201d (*21)\n\n      \u201cFal lal!\u201d said the king.\n\n      \u201c\u2018One of this nation of mighty conjurors created a man out of\n      brass and wood, and leather, and endowed him with such ingenuity\n      that he would have beaten at chess, all the race of mankind with\n      the exception of the great Caliph, Haroun Alraschid. (*22)\n      Another of these magi constructed (of like material) a creature\n      that put to shame even the genius of him who made it; for so\n      great were its reasoning powers that, in a second, it performed\n      calculations of so vast an extent that they would have required\n      the united labor of fifty thousand fleshy men for a year. (*23)\n      But a still more wonderful conjuror fashioned for himself a\n      mighty thing that was neither man nor beast, but which had brains\n      of lead, intermixed with a black matter like pitch, and fingers\n      that it employed with such incredible speed and dexterity that it\n      would have had no trouble in writing out twenty thousand copies\n      of the Koran in an hour, and this with so exquisite a precision,\n      that in all the copies there should not be found one to vary from\n      another by the breadth of the finest hair. This thing was of\n      prodigious strength, so that it erected or overthrew the\n      mightiest empires at a breath; but its powers were exercised\n      equally for evil and for good.\u2019\u201d\n\n      \u201cRidiculous!\u201d said the king.\n\n      \u201c\u2018Among this nation of necromancers there was also one who had in\n      his veins the blood of the salamanders; for he made no scruple of\n      sitting down to smoke his chibouc in a red-hot oven until his\n      dinner was thoroughly roasted upon its floor. (*24) Another had\n      the faculty of converting the common metals into gold, without\n      even looking at them during the process. (*25) Another had such a\n      delicacy of touch that he made a wire so fine as to be invisible.\n      (*26) Another had such quickness of perception that he counted\n      all the separate motions of an elastic body, while it was\n      springing backward and forward at the rate of nine hundred\n      millions of times in a second.\u2019\u201d (*27)\n\n      \u201cAbsurd!\u201d said the king.\n\n      \u201c\u2018Another of these magicians, by means of a fluid that nobody\n      ever yet saw, could make the corpses of his friends brandish\n      their arms, kick out their legs, fight, or even get up and dance\n      at his will. (*28) Another had cultivated his voice to so great\n      an extent that he could have made himself heard from one end of\n      the world to the other. (*29) Another had so long an arm that he\n      could sit down in Damascus and indite a letter at Bagdad\u2014or\n      indeed at any distance whatsoever. (*30) Another commanded the\n      lightning to come down to him out of the heavens, and it came at\n      his call; and served him for a plaything when it came. Another\n      took two loud sounds and out of them made a silence. Another\n      constructed a deep darkness out of two brilliant lights. (*31)\n      Another made ice in a red-hot furnace. (*32) Another directed the\n      sun to paint his portrait, and the sun did. (*33) Another took\n      this luminary with the moon and the planets, and having first\n      weighed them with scrupulous accuracy, probed into their depths\n      and found out the solidity of the substance of which they were\n      made. But the whole nation is, indeed, of so surprising a\n      necromantic ability, that not even their infants, nor their\n      commonest cats and dogs have any difficulty in seeing objects\n      that do not exist at all, or that for twenty millions of years\n      before the birth of the nation itself had been blotted out from\n      the face of creation.\u2019\u201d (*34)\n\n      \u201cPreposterous!\u201d said the king.\n\n      \u201c\u2018The wives and daughters of these incomparably great and wise\n      magi,\u2019\u201d continued Scheherazade, without being in any manner\n      disturbed by these frequent and most ungentlemanly interruptions\n      on the part of her husband\u2014\u201c\u2018the wives and daughters of these\n      eminent conjurers are every thing that is accomplished and\n      refined; and would be every thing that is interesting and\n      beautiful, but for an unhappy fatality that besets them, and from\n      which not even the miraculous powers of their husbands and\n      fathers has, hitherto, been adequate to save. Some fatalities\n      come in certain shapes, and some in others\u2014but this of which I\n      speak has come in the shape of a crotchet.\u2019\u201d\n\n      \u201cA what?\u201d said the king.\n\n      \u201c\u2018A crotchet\u2019\u201d said Scheherazade. \u201c\u2018One of the evil genii, who\n      are perpetually upon the watch to inflict ill, has put it into\n      the heads of these accomplished ladies that the thing which we\n      describe as personal beauty consists altogether in the\n      protuberance of the region which lies not very far below the\n      small of the back. Perfection of loveliness, they say, is in the\n      direct ratio of the extent of this lump. Having been long\n      possessed of this idea, and bolsters being cheap in that country,\n      the days have long gone by since it was possible to distinguish a\n      woman from a dromedary\u2014\u2019\u201d\n\n      \u201cStop!\u201d said the king\u2014\u201cI can\u2019t stand that, and I won\u2019t. You have\n      already given me a dreadful headache with your lies. The day,\n      too, I perceive, is beginning to break. How long have we been\n      married?\u2014my conscience is getting to be troublesome again. And\n      then that dromedary touch\u2014do you take me for a fool? Upon the\n      whole, you might as well get up and be throttled.\u201d\n\n      These words, as I learn from the \u201cIsits\u00f6ornot,\u201d both grieved and\n      astonished Scheherazade; but, as she knew the king to be a man of\n      scrupulous integrity, and quite unlikely to forfeit his word, she\n      submitted to her fate with a good grace. She derived, however,\n      great consolation, (during the tightening of the bowstring,) from\n      the reflection that much of the history remained still untold,\n      and that the petulance of her brute of a husband had reaped for\n      him a most righteous reward, in depriving him of many\n      inconceivable adventures.\n\n\n\n\nA DESCENT INTO THE MAELSTROM.\n\n\n  The ways of God in Nature, as in Providence, are not as our ways; \n  nor are the models that we frame any way commensurate to the\n  vastness, profundity, and unsearchableness of His works, _which have\n  a depth in them greater than the well of Democritus_.\n\n\u2014_Joseph Glanville_.\n\n      We had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag. For some\n      minutes the old man seemed too much exhausted to speak.\n\n      \u201cNot long ago,\u201d said he at length, \u201cand I could have guided you\n      on this route as well as the youngest of my sons; but, about\n      three years past, there happened to me an event such as never\n      happened to mortal man\u2014or at least such as no man ever survived\n      to tell of\u2014and the six hours of deadly terror which I then\n      endured have broken me up body and soul. You suppose me a _very_\n      old man\u2014but I am not. It took less than a single day to change\n      these hairs from a jetty black to white, to weaken my limbs, and\n      to unstring my nerves, so that I tremble at the least exertion,\n      and am frightened at a shadow. Do you know I can scarcely look\n      over this little cliff without getting giddy?\u201d\n\n      The \u201clittle cliff,\u201d upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown\n      himself down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung\n      over it, while he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his\n      elbow on its extreme and slippery edge\u2014this \u201clittle cliff\u201d arose,\n      a sheer unobstructed precipice of black shining rock, some\n      fifteen or sixteen hundred feet from the world of crags beneath\n      us. Nothing would have tempted me to within half a dozen yards of\n      its brink. In truth so deeply was I excited by the perilous\n      position of my companion, that I fell at full length upon the\n      ground, clung to the shrubs around me, and dared not even glance\n      upward at the sky\u2014while I struggled in vain to divest myself of\n      the idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger\n      from the fury of the winds. It was long before I could reason\n      myself into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the\n      distance.\n\n      \u201cYou must get over these fancies,\u201d said the guide, \u201cfor I have\n      brought you here that you might have the best possible view of\n      the scene of that event I mentioned\u2014and to tell you the whole\n      story with the spot just under your eye.\u201d\n\n      \u201cWe are now,\u201d he continued, in that particularizing manner which\n      distinguished him\u2014\u201cwe are now close upon the Norwegian coast\u2014in\n      the sixty-eighth degree of latitude\u2014in the great province of\n      Nordland\u2014and in the dreary district of Lofoden. The mountain upon\n      whose top we sit is Helseggen, the Cloudy. Now raise yourself up\n      a little higher\u2014hold on to the grass if you feel giddy\u2014so\u2014and\n      look out, beyond the belt of vapor beneath us, into the sea.\u201d\n\n      I looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of ocean, whose\n      waters wore so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the\n      Nubian geographer\u2019s account of the _Mare Tenebrarum_. A panorama\n      more deplorably desolate no human imagination can conceive. To\n      the right and left, as far as the eye could reach, there lay\n      outstretched, like ramparts of the world, lines of horridly black\n      and beetling cliff, whose character of gloom was but the more\n      forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against its\n      white and ghastly crest, howling and shrieking forever. Just\n      opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed, and at a\n      distance of some five or six miles out at sea, there was visible\n      a small, bleak-looking island; or, more properly, its position\n      was discernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was\n      enveloped. About two miles nearer the land, arose another of\n      smaller size, hideously craggy and barren, and encompassed at\n      various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks.\n\n      The appearance of the ocean, in the space between the more\n      distant island and the shore, had something very unusual about\n      it. Although, at the time, so strong a gale was blowing landward\n      that a brig in the remote offing lay to under a double-reefed\n      trysail, and constantly plunged her whole hull out of sight,\n      still there was here nothing like a regular swell, but only a\n      short, quick, angry cross dashing of water in every direction\u2014as\n      well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise. Of foam there was\n      little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks.\n\n      \u201cThe island in the distance,\u201d resumed the old man, \u201cis called by\n      the Norwegians Vurrgh. The one midway is Moskoe. That a mile to\n      the northward is Ambaaren. Yonder are Islesen, Hotholm,\n      Keildhelm, Suarven, and Buckholm. Farther off\u2014between Moskoe and\n      Vurrgh\u2014are Otterholm, Flimen, Sandflesen, and Stockholm. These\n      are the true names of the places\u2014but why it has been thought\n      necessary to name them at all, is more than either you or I can\n      understand. Do you hear anything? Do you see any change in the\n      water?\u201d\n\n      We had now been about ten minutes upon the top of Helseggen, to\n      which we had ascended from the interior of Lofoden, so that we\n      had caught no glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from\n      the summit. As the old man spoke, I became aware of a loud and\n      gradually increasing sound, like the moaning of a vast herd of\n      buffaloes upon an American prairie; and at the same moment I\n      perceived that what seamen term the _chopping_ character of the\n      ocean beneath us, was rapidly changing into a current which set\n      to the eastward. Even while I gazed, this current acquired a\n      monstrous velocity. Each moment added to its speed\u2014to its\n      headlong impetuosity. In five minutes the whole sea, as far as\n      Vurrgh, was lashed into ungovernable fury; but it was between\n      Moskoe and the coast that the main uproar held its sway. Here the\n      vast bed of the waters, seamed and scarred into a thousand\n      conflicting channels, burst suddenly into phrensied\n      convulsion\u2014heaving, boiling, hissing\u2014gyrating in gigantic and\n      innumerable vortices, and all whirling and plunging on to the\n      eastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes\n      except in precipitous descents.\n\n      In a few minutes more, there came over the scene another radical\n      alteration. The general surface grew somewhat more smooth, and\n      the whirlpools, one by one, disappeared, while prodigious streaks\n      of foam became apparent where none had been seen before. These\n      streaks, at length, spreading out to a great distance, and\n      entering into combination, took unto themselves the gyratory\n      motion of the subsided vortices, and seemed to form the germ of\n      another more vast. Suddenly\u2014very suddenly\u2014this assumed a distinct\n      and definite existence, in a circle of more than a mile in\n      diameter. The edge of the whirl was represented by a broad belt\n      of gleaming spray; but no particle of this slipped into the mouth\n      of the terrific funnel, whose interior, as far as the eye could\n      fathom it, was a smooth, shining, and jet-black wall of water,\n      inclined to the horizon at an angle of some forty-five degrees,\n      speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering\n      motion, and sending forth to the winds an appalling voice, half\n      shriek, half roar, such as not even the mighty cataract of\n      Niagara ever lifts up in its agony to Heaven.\n\n      The mountain trembled to its very base, and the rock rocked. I\n      threw myself upon my face, and clung to the scant herbage in an\n      excess of nervous agitation.\n\n      \u201cThis,\u201d said I at length, to the old man\u2014\u201cthis _can_ be nothing\n      else than the great whirlpool of the Maelstr\u00f6m.\u201d\n\n      \u201cSo it is sometimes termed,\u201d said he. \u201cWe Norwegians call it the\n      Moskoe-str\u00f6m, from the island of Moskoe in the midway.\u201d\n\n      The ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me\n      for what I saw. That of Jonas Ramus, which is perhaps the most\n      circumstantial of any, cannot impart the faintest conception\n      either of the magnificence, or of the horror of the scene\u2014or of\n      the wild bewildering sense of _the novel_ which confounds the\n      beholder. I am not sure from what point of view the writer in\n      question surveyed it, nor at what time; but it could neither have\n      been from the summit of Helseggen, nor during a storm. There are\n      some passages of his description, nevertheless, which may be\n      quoted for their details, although their effect is exceedingly\n      feeble in conveying an impression of the spectacle.\n\n      \u201cBetween Lofoden and Moskoe,\u201d he says, \u201cthe depth of the water is\n      between thirty-six and forty fathoms; but on the other side,\n      toward Ver (Vurrgh) this depth decreases so as not to afford a\n      convenient passage for a vessel, without the risk of splitting on\n      the rocks, which happens even in the calmest weather. When it is\n      flood, the stream runs up the country between Lofoden and Moskoe\n      with a boisterous rapidity; but the roar of its impetuous ebb to\n      the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest and most dreadful\n      cataracts; the noise being heard several leagues off, and the\n      vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth, that if a ship\n      comes within its attraction, it is inevitably absorbed and\n      carried down to the bottom, and there beat to pieces against the\n      rocks; and when the water relaxes, the fragments thereof are\n      thrown up again. But these intervals of tranquility are only at\n      the turn of the ebb and flood, and in calm weather, and last but\n      a quarter of an hour, its violence gradually returning. When the\n      stream is most boisterous, and its fury heightened by a storm, it\n      is dangerous to come within a Norway mile of it. Boats, yachts,\n      and ships have been carried away by not guarding against it\n      before they were within its reach. It likewise happens\n      frequently, that whales come too near the stream, and are\n      overpowered by its violence; and then it is impossible to\n      describe their howlings and bellowings in their fruitless\n      struggles to disengage themselves. A bear once, attempting to\n      swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught by the stream and borne\n      down, while he roared terribly, so as to be heard on shore. Large\n      stocks of firs and pine trees, after being absorbed by the\n      current, rise again broken and torn to such a degree as if\n      bristles grew upon them. This plainly shows the bottom to consist\n      of craggy rocks, among which they are whirled to and fro. This\n      stream is regulated by the flux and reflux of the sea\u2014it being\n      constantly high and low water every six hours. In the year 1645,\n      early in the morning of Sexagesima Sunday, it raged with such\n      noise and impetuosity that the very stones of the houses on the\n      coast fell to the ground.\u201d\n\n      In regard to the depth of the water, I could not see how this\n      could have been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of\n      the vortex. The \u201cforty fathoms\u201d must have reference only to\n      portions of the channel close upon the shore either of Moskoe or\n      Lofoden. The depth in the centre of the Moskoe-str\u00f6m must be\n      immeasurably greater; and no better proof of this fact is\n      necessary than can be obtained from even the sidelong glance into\n      the abyss of the whirl which may be had from the highest crag of\n      Helseggen. Looking down from this pinnacle upon the howling\n      Phlegethon below, I could not help smiling at the simplicity with\n      which the honest Jonas Ramus records, as a matter difficult of\n      belief, the anecdotes of the whales and the bears; for it\n      appeared to me, in fact, a self-evident thing, that the largest\n      ship of the line in existence, coming within the influence of\n      that deadly attraction, could resist it as little as a feather\n      the hurricane, and must disappear bodily and at once.\n\n      The attempts to account for the phenomenon\u2014some of which, I\n      remember, seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal\u2014now wore\n      a very different and unsatisfactory aspect. The idea generally\n      received is that this, as well as three smaller vortices among\n      the Ferroe islands, \u201chave no other cause than the collision of\n      waves rising and falling, at flux and reflux, against a ridge of\n      rocks and shelves, which confines the water so that it\n      precipitates itself like a cataract; and thus the higher the\n      flood rises, the deeper must the fall be, and the natural result\n      of all is a whirlpool or vortex, the prodigious suction of which\n      is sufficiently known by lesser experiments.\u201d\u2014These are the words\n      of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Kircher and others imagine that\n      in the centre of the channel of the Maelstr\u00f6m is an abyss\n      penetrating the globe, and issuing in some very remote part\u2014the\n      Gulf of Bothnia being somewhat decidedly named in one instance.\n      This opinion, idle in itself, was the one to which, as I gazed,\n      my imagination most readily assented; and, mentioning it to the\n      guide, I was rather surprised to hear him say that, although it\n      was the view almost universally entertained of the subject by the\n      Norwegians, it nevertheless was not his own. As to the former\n      notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it; and here I\n      agreed with him\u2014for, however conclusive on paper, it becomes\n      altogether unintelligible, and even absurd, amid the thunder of\n      the abyss.\n\n      \u201cYou have had a good look at the whirl now,\u201d said the old man,\n      \u201cand if you will creep round this crag, so as to get in its lee,\n      and deaden the roar of the water, I will tell you a story that\n      will convince you I ought to know something of the Moskoe-str\u00f6m.\u201d\n\n      I placed myself as desired, and he proceeded.\n\n      \u201cMyself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged smack of\n      about seventy tons burthen, with which we were in the habit of\n      fishing among the islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to Vurrgh. In all\n      violent eddies at sea there is good fishing, at proper\n      opportunities, if one has only the courage to attempt it; but\n      among the whole of the Lofoden coastmen, we three were the only\n      ones who made a regular business of going out to the islands, as\n      I tell you. The usual grounds are a great way lower down to the\n      southward. There fish can be got at all hours, without much risk,\n      and therefore these places are preferred. The choice spots over\n      here among the rocks, however, not only yield the finest variety,\n      but in far greater abundance; so that we often got in a single\n      day, what the more timid of the craft could not scrape together\n      in a week. In fact, we made it a matter of desperate\n      speculation\u2014the risk of life standing instead of labor, and\n      courage answering for capital.\n\n      \u201cWe kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast\n      than this; and it was our practice, in fine weather, to take\n      advantage of the fifteen minutes\u2019 slack to push across the main\n      channel of the Moskoe-str\u00f6m, far above the pool, and then drop\n      down upon anchorage somewhere near Otterholm, or Sandflesen,\n      where the eddies are not so violent as elsewhere. Here we used to\n      remain until nearly time for slack-water again, when we weighed\n      and made for home. We never set out upon this expedition without\n      a steady side wind for going and coming\u2014one that we felt sure\n      would not fail us before our return\u2014and we seldom made a\n      mis-calculation upon this point. Twice, during six years, we were\n      forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead calm,\n      which is a rare thing indeed just about here; and once we had to\n      remain on the grounds nearly a week, starving to death, owing to\n      a gale which blew up shortly after our arrival, and made the\n      channel too boisterous to be thought of. Upon this occasion we\n      should have been driven out to sea in spite of everything, (for\n      the whirlpools threw us round and round so violently, that, at\n      length, we fouled our anchor and dragged it) if it had not been\n      that we drifted into one of the innumerable cross currents\u2014here\n      to-day and gone to-morrow\u2014which drove us under the lee of Flimen,\n      where, by good luck, we brought up.\n\n      \u201cI could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we\n      encountered \u2018on the grounds\u2019\u2014it is a bad spot to be in, even in\n      good weather\u2014but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the\n      Moskoe-str\u00f6m itself without accident; although at times my heart\n      has been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind\n      or before the slack. The wind sometimes was not as strong as we\n      thought it at starting, and then we made rather less way than we\n      could wish, while the current rendered the smack unmanageable. My\n      eldest brother had a son eighteen years old, and I had two stout\n      boys of my own. These would have been of great assistance at such\n      times, in using the sweeps, as well as afterward in fishing\u2014but,\n      somehow, although we ran the risk ourselves, we had not the heart\n      to let the young ones get into the danger\u2014for, after all is said\n      and done, it _was_ a horrible danger, and that is the truth.\n\n      \u201cIt is now within a few days of three years since what I am going\n      to tell you occurred. It was on the tenth day of July, 18\u2014, a day\n      which the people of this part of the world will never forget\u2014for\n      it was one in which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever\n      came out of the heavens. And yet all the morning, and indeed\n      until late in the afternoon, there was a gentle and steady breeze\n      from the south-west, while the sun shone brightly, so that the\n      oldest seaman among us could not have foreseen what was to\n      follow.\n\n      \u201cThe three of us\u2014my two brothers and myself\u2014had crossed over to\n      the islands about two o\u2019clock P. M., and had soon nearly loaded\n      the smack with fine fish, which, we all remarked, were more\n      plenty that day than we had ever known them. It was just seven,\n      _by my watch_, when we weighed and started for home, so as to\n      make the worst of the Str\u00f6m at slack water, which we knew would\n      be at eight.\n\n      \u201cWe set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter, and for\n      some time spanked along at a great rate, never dreaming of\n      danger, for indeed we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend\n      it. All at once we were taken aback by a breeze from over\n      Helseggen. This was most unusual\u2014something that had never\n      happened to us before\u2014and I began to feel a little uneasy,\n      without exactly knowing why. We put the boat on the wind, but\n      could make no headway at all for the eddies, and I was upon the\n      point of proposing to return to the anchorage, when, looking\n      astern, we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular\n      copper-colored cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity.\n\n      \u201cIn the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away, and\n      we were dead becalmed, drifting about in every direction. This\n      state of things, however, did not last long enough to give us\n      time to think about it. In less than a minute the storm was upon\n      us\u2014in less than two the sky was entirely overcast\u2014and what with\n      this and the driving spray, it became suddenly so dark that we\n      could not see each other in the smack.\n\n      \u201cSuch a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing.\n      The oldest seaman in Norway never experienced any thing like it.\n      We had let our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us;\n      but, at the first puff, both our masts went by the board as if\n      they had been sawed off\u2014the mainmast taking with it my youngest\n      brother, who had lashed himself to it for safety.\n\n      \u201cOur boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon\n      water. It had a complete flush deck, with only a small hatch near\n      the bow, and this hatch it had always been our custom to batten\n      down when about to cross the Str\u00f6m, by way of precaution against\n      the chopping seas. But for this circumstance we should have\n      foundered at once\u2014for we lay entirely buried for some moments.\n      How my elder brother escaped destruction I cannot say, for I\n      never had an opportunity of ascertaining. For my part, as soon as\n      I had let the foresail run, I threw myself flat on deck, with my\n      feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow, and with my hands\n      grasping a ring-bolt near the foot of the fore-mast. It was mere\n      instinct that prompted me to do this\u2014which was undoubtedly the\n      very best thing I could have done\u2014for I was too much flurried to\n      think.\n\n      \u201cFor some moments we were completely deluged, as I say, and all\n      this time I held my breath, and clung to the bolt. When I could\n      stand it no longer I raised myself upon my knees, still keeping\n      hold with my hands, and thus got my head clear. Presently our\n      little boat gave herself a shake, just as a dog does in coming\n      out of the water, and thus rid herself, in some measure, of the\n      seas. I was now trying to get the better of the stupor that had\n      come over me, and to collect my senses so as to see what was to\n      be done, when I felt somebody grasp my arm. It was my elder\n      brother, and my heart leaped for joy, for I had made sure that he\n      was overboard\u2014but the next moment all this joy was turned into\n      horror\u2014for he put his mouth close to my ear, and screamed out the\n      word \u2018_Moskoe-str\u00f6m!_\u2019\n\n      \u201cNo one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment. I\n      shook from head to foot as if I had had the most violent fit of\n      the ague. I knew what he meant by that one word well enough\u2014I\n      knew what he wished to make me understand. With the wind that now\n      drove us on, we were bound for the whirl of the Str\u00f6m, and\n      nothing could save us!\n\n      \u201cYou perceive that in crossing the Str\u00f6m _channel_, we always\n      went a long way up above the whirl, even in the calmest weather,\n      and then had to wait and watch carefully for the slack\u2014but now we\n      were driving right upon the pool itself, and in such a hurricane\n      as this! \u2018To be sure,\u2019 I thought, \u2018we shall get there just about\n      the slack\u2014there is some little hope in that\u2019\u2014but in the next\n      moment I cursed myself for being so great a fool as to dream of\n      hope at all. I knew very well that we were doomed, had we been\n      ten times a ninety-gun ship.\n\n      \u201cBy this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself, or\n      perhaps we did not feel it so much, as we scudded before it, but\n      at all events the seas, which at first had been kept down by the\n      wind, and lay flat and frothing, now got up into absolute\n      mountains. A singular change, too, had come over the heavens.\n      Around in every direction it was still as black as pitch, but\n      nearly overhead there burst out, all at once, a circular rift of\n      clear sky\u2014as clear as I ever saw\u2014and of a deep bright blue\u2014and\n      through it there blazed forth the full moon with a lustre that I\n      never before knew her to wear. She lit up every thing about us\n      with the greatest distinctness\u2014but, oh God, what a scene it was\n      to light up!\n\n      \u201cI now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother\u2014but, in\n      some manner which I could not understand, the din had so\n      increased that I could not make him hear a single word, although\n      I screamed at the top of my voice in his ear. Presently he shook\n      his head, looking as pale as death, and held up one of his\n      fingers, as if to say _\u2018listen! \u2018_\n\n      \u201cAt first I could not make out what he meant\u2014but soon a hideous\n      thought flashed upon me. I dragged my watch from its fob. It was\n      not going. I glanced at its face by the moonlight, and then burst\n      into tears as I flung it far away into the ocean. _It had run\n      down at seven o\u2019clock! We were behind the time of the slack, and\n      the whirl of the Str\u00f6m was in full fury!_\n\n      \u201cWhen a boat is well built, properly trimmed, and not deep laden,\n      the waves in a strong gale, when she is going large, seem always\n      to slip from beneath her\u2014which appears very strange to a\n      landsman\u2014and this is what is called _riding_, in sea phrase.\n\n      \u201cWell, so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly; but\n      presently a gigantic sea happened to take us right under the\n      counter, and bore us with it as it rose\u2014up\u2014up\u2014as if into the sky.\n      I would not have believed that any wave could rise so high. And\n      then down we came with a sweep, a slide, and a plunge, that made\n      me feel sick and dizzy, as if I was falling from some lofty\n      mountain-top in a dream. But while we were up I had thrown a\n      quick glance around\u2014and that one glance was all sufficient. I saw\n      our exact position in an instant. The Moskoe-Str\u00f6m whirlpool was\n      about a quarter of a mile dead ahead\u2014but no more like the\n      every-day Moskoe-Str\u00f6m than the whirl as you now see it, is like\n      a mill-race. If I had not known where we were, and what we had to\n      expect, I should not have recognised the place at all. As it was,\n      I involuntarily closed my eyes in horror. The lids clenched\n      themselves together as if in a spasm.\n\n      \u201cIt could not have been more than two minutes afterward until we\n      suddenly felt the waves subside, and were enveloped in foam. The\n      boat made a sharp half turn to larboard, and then shot off in its\n      new direction like a thunderbolt. At the same moment the roaring\n      noise of the water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill\n      shriek\u2014such a sound as you might imagine given out by the\n      waste-pipes of many thousand steam-vessels, letting off their\n      steam all together. We were now in the belt of surf that always\n      surrounds the whirl; and I thought, of course, that another\n      moment would plunge us into the abyss, down which we could only\n      see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which we\n      wore borne along. The boat did not seem to sink into the water at\n      all, but to skim like an air-bubble upon the surface of the\n      surge. Her starboard side was next the whirl, and on the larboard\n      arose the world of ocean we had left. It stood like a huge\n      writhing wall between us and the horizon.\n\n      \u201cIt may appear strange, but now, when we were in the very jaws of\n      the gulf, I felt more composed than when we were only approaching\n      it. Having made up my mind to hope no more, I got rid of a great\n      deal of that terror which unmanned me at first. I suppose it was\n      despair that strung my nerves.\n\n      \u201cIt may look like boasting\u2014but what I tell you is truth\u2014I began\n      to reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a\n      manner, and how foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a\n      consideration as my own individual life, in view of so wonderful\n      a manifestation of God\u2019s power. I do believe that I blushed with\n      shame when this idea crossed my mind. After a little while I\n      became possessed with the keenest curiosity about the whirl\n      itself. I positively felt a _wish_ to explore its depths, even at\n      the sacrifice I was going to make; and my principal grief was\n      that I should never be able to tell my old companions on shore\n      about the mysteries I should see. These, no doubt, were singular\n      fancies to occupy a man\u2019s mind in such extremity\u2014and I have often\n      thought since, that the revolutions of the boat around the pool\n      might have rendered me a little light-headed.\n\n      \u201cThere was another circumstance which tended to restore my\n      self-possession; and this was the cessation of the wind, which\n      could not reach us in our present situation\u2014for, as you saw\n      yourself, the belt of surf is considerably lower than the general\n      bed of the ocean, and this latter now towered above us, a high,\n      black, mountainous ridge. If you have never been at sea in a\n      heavy gale, you can form no idea of the confusion of mind\n      occasioned by the wind and spray together. They blind, deafen,\n      and strangle you, and take away all power of action or\n      reflection. But we were now, in a great measure, rid of these\n      annoyances\u2014just as death-condemned felons in prison are allowed\n      petty indulgences, forbidden them while their doom is yet\n      uncertain.\n\n      \u201cHow often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to\n      say. We careered round and round for perhaps an hour, flying\n      rather than floating, getting gradually more and more into the\n      middle of the surge, and then nearer and nearer to its horrible\n      inner edge. All this time I had never let go of the ring-bolt. My\n      brother was at the stern, holding on to a small empty water-cask\n      which had been securely lashed under the coop of the counter, and\n      was the only thing on deck that had not been swept overboard when\n      the gale first took us. As we approached the brink of the pit he\n      let go his hold upon this, and made for the ring, from which, in\n      the agony of his terror, he endeavored to force my hands, as it\n      was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp. I never\n      felt deeper grief than when I saw him attempt this act\u2014although I\n      knew he was a madman when he did it\u2014a raving maniac through sheer\n      fright. I did not care, however, to contest the point with him. I\n      knew it could make no difference whether either of us held on at\n      all; so I let him have the bolt, and went astern to the cask.\n      This there was no great difficulty in doing; for the smack flew\n      round steadily enough, and upon an even keel\u2014only swaying to and\n      fro, with the immense sweeps and swelters of the whirl. Scarcely\n      had I secured myself in my new position, when we gave a wild\n      lurch to starboard, and rushed headlong into the abyss. I\n      muttered a hurried prayer to God, and thought all was over.\n\n      \u201cAs I felt the sickening sweep of the descent, I had\n      instinctively tightened my hold upon the barrel, and closed my\n      eyes. For some seconds I dared not open them\u2014while I expected\n      instant destruction, and wondered that I was not already in my\n      death-struggles with the water. But moment after moment elapsed.\n      I still lived. The sense of falling had ceased; and the motion of\n      the vessel seemed much as it had been before, while in the belt\n      of foam, with the exception that she now lay more along. I took\n      courage, and looked once again upon the scene.\n\n      \u201cNever shall I forget the sensations of awe, horror, and\n      admiration with which I gazed about me. The boat appeared to be\n      hanging, as if by magic, midway down, upon the interior surface\n      of a funnel vast in circumference, prodigious in depth, and whose\n      perfectly smooth sides might have been mistaken for ebony, but\n      for the bewildering rapidity with which they spun around, and for\n      the gleaming and ghastly radiance they shot forth, as the rays of\n      the full moon, from that circular rift amid the clouds which I\n      have already described, streamed in a flood of golden glory along\n      the black walls, and far away down into the inmost recesses of\n      the abyss.\n\n      \u201cAt first I was too much confused to observe anything accurately.\n      The general burst of terrific grandeur was all that I beheld.\n      When I recovered myself a little, however, my gaze fell\n      instinctively downward. In this direction I was able to obtain an\n      unobstructed view, from the manner in which the smack hung on the\n      inclined surface of the pool. She was quite upon an even\n      keel\u2014that is to say, her deck lay in a plane parallel with that\n      of the water\u2014but this latter sloped at an angle of more than\n      forty-five degrees, so that we seemed to be lying upon our\n      beam-ends. I could not help observing, nevertheless, that I had\n      scarcely more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in\n      this situation, than if we had been upon a dead level; and this,\n      I suppose, was owing to the speed at which we revolved.\n\n      \u201cThe rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the\n      profound gulf; but still I could make out nothing distinctly, on\n      account of a thick mist in which everything there was enveloped,\n      and over which there hung a magnificent rainbow, like that narrow\n      and tottering bridge which Mussulmen say is the only pathway\n      between Time and Eternity. This mist, or spray, was no doubt\n      occasioned by the clashing of the great walls of the funnel, as\n      they all met together at the bottom\u2014but the yell that went up to\n      the Heavens from out of that mist, I dare not attempt to\n      describe.\n\n      \u201cOur first slide into the abyss itself, from the belt of foam\n      above, had carried us a great distance down the slope; but our\n      farther descent was by no means proportionate. Round and round we\n      swept\u2014not with any uniform movement\u2014but in dizzying swings and\n      jerks, that sent us sometimes only a few hundred yards\u2014sometimes\n      nearly the complete circuit of the whirl. Our progress downward,\n      at each revolution, was slow, but very perceptible.\n\n      \u201cLooking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we\n      were thus borne, I perceived that our boat was not the only\n      object in the embrace of the whirl. Both above and below us were\n      visible fragments of vessels, large masses of building timber and\n      trunks of trees, with many smaller articles, such as pieces of\n      house furniture, broken boxes, barrels and staves. I have already\n      described the unnatural curiosity which had taken the place of my\n      original terrors. It appeared to grow upon me as I drew nearer\n      and nearer to my dreadful doom. I now began to watch, with a\n      strange interest, the numerous things that floated in our\n      company. I _must_ have been delirious, for I even sought\n      _amusement_ in speculating upon the relative velocities of their\n      several descents toward the foam below. \u2018This fir tree,\u2019 I found\n      myself at one time saying, \u2018will certainly be the next thing that\n      takes the awful plunge and disappears,\u2019\u2014and then I was\n      disappointed to find that the wreck of a Dutch merchant ship\n      overtook it and went down before. At length, after making several\n      guesses of this nature, and being deceived in all\u2014this fact\u2014the\n      fact of my invariable miscalculation, set me upon a train of\n      reflection that made my limbs again tremble, and my heart beat\n      heavily once more.\n\n      \u201cIt was not a new terror that thus affected me, but the dawn of a\n      more exciting _hope_. This hope arose partly from memory, and\n      partly from present observation. I called to mind the great\n      variety of buoyant matter that strewed the coast of Lofoden,\n      having been absorbed and then thrown forth by the Moskoe-str\u00f6m.\n      By far the greater number of the articles were shattered in the\n      most extraordinary way\u2014so chafed and roughened as to have the\n      appearance of being stuck full of splinters\u2014but then I distinctly\n      recollected that there were _some_ of them which were not\n      disfigured at all. Now I could not account for this difference\n      except by supposing that the roughened fragments were the only\n      ones which had been _completely absorbed_\u2014that the others had\n      entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide, or, for some\n      reason, had descended so slowly after entering, that they did not\n      reach the bottom before the turn of the flood came, or of the\n      ebb, as the case might be. I conceived it possible, in either\n      instance, that they might thus be whirled up again to the level\n      of the ocean, without undergoing the fate of those which had been\n      drawn in more early, or absorbed more rapidly. I made, also,\n      three important observations. The first was, that, as a general\n      rule, the larger the bodies were, the more rapid their\n      descent\u2014the second, that, between two masses of equal extent, the\n      one spherical, and the other _of any other shape_, the\n      superiority in speed of descent was with the sphere\u2014the third,\n      that, between two masses of equal size, the one cylindrical, and\n      the other of any other shape, the cylinder was absorbed the more\n      slowly. Since my escape, I have had several conversations on this\n      subject with an old school-master of the district; and it was\n      from him that I learned the use of the words \u2018cylinder\u2019 and\n      \u2018sphere.\u2019 He explained to me\u2014although I have forgotten the\n      explanation\u2014how what I observed was, in fact, the natural\n      consequence of the forms of the floating fragments\u2014and showed me\n      how it happened that a cylinder, swimming in a vortex, offered\n      more resistance to its suction, and was drawn in with greater\n      difficulty than an equally bulky body, of any form whatever. (*1)\n\n      \u201cThere was one startling circumstance which went a great way in\n      enforcing these observations, and rendering me anxious to turn\n      them to account, and this was that, at every revolution, we\n      passed something like a barrel, or else the yard or the mast of a\n      vessel, while many of these things, which had been on our level\n      when I first opened my eyes upon the wonders of the whirlpool,\n      were now high up above us, and seemed to have moved but little\n      from their original station.\n\n      \u201cI no longer hesitated what to do. I resolved to lash myself\n      securely to the water cask upon which I now held, to cut it loose\n      from the counter, and to throw myself with it into the water. I\n      attracted my brother\u2019s attention by signs, pointed to the\n      floating barrels that came near us, and did everything in my\n      power to make him understand what I was about to do. I thought at\n      length that he comprehended my design\u2014but, whether this was the\n      case or not, he shook his head despairingly, and refused to move\n      from his station by the ring-bolt. It was impossible to reach\n      him; the emergency admitted of no delay; and so, with a bitter\n      struggle, I resigned him to his fate, fastened myself to the cask\n      by means of the lashings which secured it to the counter, and\n      precipitated myself with it into the sea, without another\n      moment\u2019s hesitation.\n\n      \u201cThe result was precisely what I had hoped it might be. As it is\n      myself who now tell you this tale\u2014as you see that I _did_\n      escape\u2014and as you are already in possession of the mode in which\n      this escape was effected, and must therefore anticipate all that\n      I have farther to say\u2014I will bring my story quickly to\n      conclusion. It might have been an hour, or thereabout, after my\n      quitting the smack, when, having descended to a vast distance\n      beneath me, it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid\n      succession, and, bearing my loved brother with it, plunged\n      headlong, at once and forever, into the chaos of foam below. The\n      barrel to which I was attached sunk very little farther than half\n      the distance between the bottom of the gulf and the spot at which\n      I leaped overboard, before a great change took place in the\n      character of the whirlpool. The slope of the sides of the vast\n      funnel became momently less and less steep. The gyrations of the\n      whirl grew, gradually, less and less violent. By degrees, the\n      froth and the rainbow disappeared, and the bottom of the gulf\n      seemed slowly to uprise. The sky was clear, the winds had gone\n      down, and the full moon was setting radiantly in the west, when I\n      found myself on the surface of the ocean, in full view of the\n      shores of Lofoden, and above the spot where the pool of the\n      Moskoe-str\u00f6m _had been_. It was the hour of the slack\u2014but the sea\n      still heaved in mountainous waves from the effects of the\n      hurricane. I was borne violently into the channel of the Str\u00f6m,\n      and in a few minutes was hurried down the coast into the\n      \u2018grounds\u2019 of the fishermen. A boat picked me up\u2014exhausted from\n      fatigue\u2014and (now that the danger was removed) speechless from the\n      memory of its horror. Those who drew me on board were my old\n      mates and daily companions\u2014but they knew me no more than they\n      would have known a traveller from the spirit-land. My hair which\n      had been raven-black the day before, was as white as you see it\n      now. They say too that the whole expression of my countenance had\n      changed. I told them my story\u2014they did not believe it. I now tell\n      it to _you_\u2014and I can scarcely expect you to put more faith in it\n      than did the merry fishermen of Lofoden.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nVON KEMPELEN AND HIS DISCOVERY\n\n\n      After the very minute and elaborate paper by Arago, to say\n      nothing of the summary in \u2018Silliman\u2019s Journal,\u2019 with the detailed\n      statement just published by Lieutenant Maury, it will not be\n      supposed, of course, that in offering a few hurried remarks in\n      reference to Von Kempelen\u2019s discovery, I have any design to look\n      at the subject in a scientific point of view. My object is\n      simply, in the first place, to say a few words of Von Kempelen\n      himself (with whom, some years ago, I had the honor of a slight\n      personal acquaintance), since every thing which concerns him must\n      necessarily, at this moment, be of interest; and, in the second\n      place, to look in a general way, and speculatively, at the\n      results of the discovery.\n\n      It may be as well, however, to premise the cursory observations\n      which I have to offer, by denying, very decidedly, what seems to\n      be a general impression (gleaned, as usual in a case of this\n      kind, from the newspapers), viz.: that this discovery, astounding\n      as it unquestionably is, is unanticipated.\n\n      By reference to the \u2018Diary of Sir Humphrey Davy\u2019 (Cottle and\n      Munroe, London, pp. 150), it will be seen at pp. 53 and 82, that\n      this illustrious chemist had not only conceived the idea now in\n      question, but had actually made no inconsiderable progress,\n      experimentally, in the very identical analysis now so\n      triumphantly brought to an issue by Von Kempelen, who although he\n      makes not the slightest allusion to it, is, without doubt (I say\n      it unhesitatingly, and can prove it, if required), indebted to\n      the \u2018Diary\u2019 for at least the first hint of his own undertaking.\n\n      The paragraph from the \u2018Courier and Enquirer,\u2019 which is now going\n      the rounds of the press, and which purports to claim the\n      invention for a Mr. Kissam, of Brunswick, Maine, appears to me, I\n      confess, a little apocryphal, for several reasons; although there\n      is nothing either impossible or very improbable in the statement\n      made. I need not go into details. My opinion of the paragraph is\n      founded principally upon its manner. It does not look true.\n      Persons who are narrating facts, are seldom so particular as Mr.\n      Kissam seems to be, about day and date and precise location.\n      Besides, if Mr. Kissam actually did come upon the discovery he\n      says he did, at the period designated\u2014nearly eight years ago\u2014how\n      happens it that he took no steps, on the instant, to reap the\n      immense benefits which the merest bumpkin must have known would\n      have resulted to him individually, if not to the world at large,\n      from the discovery? It seems to me quite incredible that any man\n      of common understanding could have discovered what Mr. Kissam\n      says he did, and yet have subsequently acted so like a baby\u2014so\n      like an owl\u2014as Mr. Kissam admits that he did. By-the-way, who is\n      Mr. Kissam? and is not the whole paragraph in the \u2018Courier and\n      Enquirer\u2019 a fabrication got up to \u2018make a talk\u2019? It must be\n      confessed that it has an amazingly moon-hoaxy-air. Very little\n      dependence is to be placed upon it, in my humble opinion; and if\n      I were not well aware, from experience, how very easily men of\n      science are mystified, on points out of their usual range of\n      inquiry, I should be profoundly astonished at finding so eminent\n      a chemist as Professor Draper, discussing Mr. Kissam\u2019s (or is it\n      Mr. Quizzem\u2019s?) pretensions to the discovery, in so serious a\n      tone.\n\n      But to return to the \u2018Diary\u2019 of Sir Humphrey Davy. This pamphlet\n      was not designed for the public eye, even upon the decease of the\n      writer, as any person at all conversant with authorship may\n      satisfy himself at once by the slightest inspection of the style.\n      At page 13, for example, near the middle, we read, in reference\n      to his researches about the protoxide of azote: \u2018In less than\n      half a minute the respiration being continued, diminished\n      gradually and were succeeded by analogous to gentle pressure on\n      all the muscles.\u2019 That the respiration was not \u2018diminished,\u2019 is\n      not only clear by the subsequent context, but by the use of the\n      plural, \u2018were.\u2019 The sentence, no doubt, was thus intended: \u2018In\n      less than half a minute, the respiration [being continued, these\n      feelings] diminished gradually, and were succeeded by [a\n      sensation] analogous to gentle pressure on all the muscles.\u2019 A\n      hundred similar instances go to show that the MS. so\n      inconsiderately published, was merely a rough note-book, meant\n      only for the writer\u2019s own eye, but an inspection of the pamphlet\n      will convince almost any thinking person of the truth of my\n      suggestion. The fact is, Sir Humphrey Davy was about the last man\n      in the world to commit himself on scientific topics. Not only had\n      he a more than ordinary dislike to quackery, but he was morbidly\n      afraid of appearing empirical; so that, however fully he might\n      have been convinced that he was on the right track in the matter\n      now in question, he would never have spoken out, until he had\n      every thing ready for the most practical demonstration. I verily\n      believe that his last moments would have been rendered wretched,\n      could he have suspected that his wishes in regard to burning this\n      \u2018Diary\u2019 (full of crude speculations) would have been unattended\n      to; as, it seems, they were. I say \u2018his wishes,\u2019 for that he\n      meant to include this note-book among the miscellaneous papers\n      directed \u2018to be burnt,\u2019 I think there can be no manner of doubt.\n      Whether it escaped the flames by good fortune or by bad, yet\n      remains to be seen. That the passages quoted above, with the\n      other similar ones referred to, gave Von Kempelen the hint, I do\n      not in the slightest degree question; but I repeat, it yet\n      remains to be seen whether this momentous discovery itself\n      (momentous under any circumstances) will be of service or\n      disservice to mankind at large. That Von Kempelen and his\n      immediate friends will reap a rich harvest, it would be folly to\n      doubt for a moment. They will scarcely be so weak as not to\n      \u2018realize,\u2019 in time, by large purchases of houses and land, with\n      other property of intrinsic value.\n\n      In the brief account of Von Kempelen which appeared in the \u2018Home\n      Journal,\u2019 and has since been extensively copied, several\n      misapprehensions of the German original seem to have been made by\n      the translator, who professes to have taken the passage from a\n      late number of the Presburg \u2018Schnellpost.\u2019 \u2018Viele\u2019 has evidently\n      been misconceived (as it often is), and what the translator\n      renders by \u2018sorrows,\u2019 is probably \u2018lieden,\u2019 which, in its true\n      version, \u2018sufferings,\u2019 would give a totally different complexion\n      to the whole account; but, of course, much of this is merely\n      guess, on my part.\n\n      Von Kempelen, however, is by no means \u2018a misanthrope,\u2019 in\n      appearance, at least, whatever he may be in fact. My acquaintance\n      with him was casual altogether; and I am scarcely warranted in\n      saying that I know him at all; but to have seen and conversed\n      with a man of so _prodigious_ a notoriety as he has attained, or\n      _will_ attain in a few days, is not a small matter, as times go.\n\n      \u201cThe Literary World\u201d speaks of him, confidently, as a native of\n      Presburg (misled, perhaps, by the account in \u201cThe Home Journal\u201d)\n      but I am pleased in being able to state _positively_, since I\n      have it from his own lips, that he was born in Utica, in the\n      State of New York, although both his parents, I believe, are of\n      Presburg descent. The family is connected, in some way, with\n      M\u00e4elzel, of Automaton-chess-player memory. In person, he is short\n      and stout, with large, _fat_, blue eyes, sandy hair and whiskers,\n      a wide but pleasing mouth, fine teeth, and I think a Roman nose.\n      There is some defect in one of his feet. His address is frank,\n      and his whole manner noticeable for bonhomie. Altogether, he\n      looks, speaks, and acts as little like \u2018a misanthrope\u2019 as any man\n      I ever saw. We were fellow-sojourners for a week about six years\n      ago, at Earl\u2019s Hotel, in Providence, Rhode Island; and I presume\n      that I conversed with him, at various times, for some three or\n      four hours altogether. His principal topics were those of the\n      day; and nothing that fell from him led me to suspect his\n      scientific attainments. He left the hotel before me, intending to\n      go to New York, and thence to Bremen; it was in the latter city\n      that his great discovery was first made public; or, rather, it\n      was there that he was first suspected of having made it. This is\n      about all that I personally know of the now immortal Von\n      Kempelen; but I have thought that even these few details would\n      have interest for the public.\n\n      There can be little question that most of the marvellous rumors\n      afloat about this affair are pure inventions, entitled to about\n      as much credit as the story of Aladdin\u2019s lamp; and yet, in a case\n      of this kind, as in the case of the discoveries in California, it\n      is clear that the truth may be stranger than fiction. The\n      following anecdote, at least, is so well authenticated, that we\n      may receive it implicitly.\n\n      Von Kempelen had never been even tolerably well off during his\n      residence at Bremen; and often, it was well known, he had been\n      put to extreme shifts in order to raise trifling sums. When the\n      great excitement occurred about the forgery on the house of\n      Gutsmuth & Co., suspicion was directed toward Von Kempelen, on\n      account of his having purchased a considerable property in\n      Gasperitch Lane, and his refusing, when questioned, to explain\n      how he became possessed of the purchase money. He was at length\n      arrested, but nothing decisive appearing against him, was in the\n      end set at liberty. The police, however, kept a strict watch upon\n      his movements, and thus discovered that he left home frequently,\n      taking always the same road, and invariably giving his watchers\n      the slip in the neighborhood of that labyrinth of narrow and\n      crooked passages known by the flash name of the \u2018Dondergat.\u2019\n      Finally, by dint of great perseverance, they traced him to a\n      garret in an old house of seven stories, in an alley called\n      Flatzplatz,\u2014and, coming upon him suddenly, found him, as they\n      imagined, in the midst of his counterfeiting operations. His\n      agitation is represented as so excessive that the officers had\n      not the slightest doubt of his guilt. After hand-cuffing him,\n      they searched his room, or rather rooms, for it appears he\n      occupied all the mansarde.\n\n      Opening into the garret where they caught him, was a closet, ten\n      feet by eight, fitted up with some chemical apparatus, of which\n      the object has not yet been ascertained. In one corner of the\n      closet was a very small furnace, with a glowing fire in it, and\n      on the fire a kind of duplicate crucible\u2014two crucibles connected\n      by a tube. One of these crucibles was nearly full of lead in a\n      state of fusion, but not reaching up to the aperture of the tube,\n      which was close to the brim. The other crucible had some liquid\n      in it, which, as the officers entered, seemed to be furiously\n      dissipating in vapor. They relate that, on finding himself taken,\n      Kempelen seized the crucibles with both hands (which were encased\n      in gloves that afterwards turned out to be asbestic), and threw\n      the contents on the tiled floor. It was now that they hand-cuffed\n      him; and before proceeding to ransack the premises they searched\n      his person, but nothing unusual was found about him, excepting a\n      paper parcel, in his coat-pocket, containing what was afterward\n      ascertained to be a mixture of antimony and some unknown\n      substance, in nearly, but not quite, equal proportions. All\n      attempts at analyzing the unknown substance have, so far, failed,\n      but that it will ultimately be analyzed, is not to be doubted.\n\n      Passing out of the closet with their prisoner, the officers went\n      through a sort of ante-chamber, in which nothing material was\n      found, to the chemist\u2019s sleeping-room. They here rummaged some\n      drawers and boxes, but discovered only a few papers, of no\n      importance, and some good coin, silver and gold. At length,\n      looking under the bed, they saw a large, common hair trunk,\n      without hinges, hasp, or lock, and with the top lying carelessly\n      across the bottom portion. Upon attempting to draw this trunk out\n      from under the bed, they found that, with their united strength\n      (there were three of them, all powerful men), they \u2018could not\n      stir it one inch.\u2019 Much astonished at this, one of them crawled\n      under the bed, and looking into the trunk, said:\n\n      \u2018No wonder we couldn\u2019t move it\u2014why it\u2019s full to the brim of old\n      bits of brass!\u2019\n\n      Putting his feet, now, against the wall so as to get a good\n      purchase, and pushing with all his force, while his companions\n      pulled with all theirs, the trunk, with much difficulty, was slid\n      out from under the bed, and its contents examined. The supposed\n      brass with which it was filled was all in small, smooth pieces,\n      varying from the size of a pea to that of a dollar; but the\n      pieces were irregular in shape, although more or less\n      flat-looking, upon the whole, \u201cvery much as lead looks when\n      thrown upon the ground in a molten state, and there suffered to\n      grow cool.\u201d Now, not one of these officers for a moment suspected\n      this metal to be anything _but_ brass. The idea of its being\n      _gold_ never entered their brains, of course; how _could_ such a\n      wild fancy have entered it? And their astonishment may be well\n      conceived, when the next day it became known, all over Bremen,\n      that the \u201clot of brass\u201d which they had carted so contemptuously\n      to the police office, without putting themselves to the trouble\n      of pocketing the smallest scrap, was not only gold\u2014real gold\u2014but\n      gold far finer than any employed in coinage\u2014gold, in fact,\n      absolutely pure, virgin, without the slightest appreciable alloy.\n\n      I need not go over the details of Von Kempelen\u2019s confession (as\n      far as it went) and release, for these are familiar to the\n      public. That he has actually realized, in spirit and in effect,\n      if not to the letter, the old chimaera of the philosopher\u2019s\n      stone, no sane person is at liberty to doubt. The opinions of\n      Arago are, of course, entitled to the greatest consideration; but\n      he is by no means infallible; and what he says of bismuth, in his\n      report to the Academy, must be taken _cum grano salis_. The\n      simple truth is, that up to this period all analysis has failed;\n      and until Von Kempelen chooses to let us have the key to his own\n      published enigma, it is more than probable that the matter will\n      remain, for years, in statu quo. All that as yet can fairly be\n      said to be known is, that \u2018Pure gold can be made at will, and\n      very readily from lead in connection with certain other\n      substances, in kind and in proportions, unknown.\u2019\n\n      Speculation, of course, is busy as to the immediate and ultimate\n      results of this discovery\u2014a discovery which few thinking persons\n      will hesitate in referring to an increased interest in the matter\n      of gold generally, by the late developments in California; and\n      this reflection brings us inevitably to another\u2014the exceeding\n      inopportuneness of Von Kempelen\u2019s analysis. If many were\n      prevented from adventuring to California, by the mere\n      apprehension that gold would so materially diminish in value, on\n      account of its plentifulness in the mines there, as to render the\n      speculation of going so far in search of it a doubtful one\u2014what\n      impression will be wrought now, upon the minds of those about to\n      emigrate, and especially upon the minds of those actually in the\n      mineral region, by the announcement of this astounding discovery\n      of Von Kempelen? a discovery which declares, in so many words,\n      that beyond its intrinsic worth for manufacturing purposes\n      (whatever that worth may be), gold now is, or at least soon will\n      be (for it cannot be supposed that Von Kempelen can long retain\n      his secret), of no greater value than lead, and of far inferior\n      value to silver. It is, indeed, exceedingly difficult to\n      speculate prospectively upon the consequences of the discovery,\n      but one thing may be positively maintained\u2014that the announcement\n      of the discovery six months ago would have had material influence\n      in regard to the settlement of California.\n\n      In Europe, as yet, the most noticeable results have been a rise\n      of two hundred per cent. in the price of lead, and nearly\n      twenty-five per cent. that of silver.\n\n\n\n\nMESMERIC REVELATION\n\n\nWhatever doubt may still envelop the _rationale_ of mesmerism, its\nstartling _facts_ are now almost universally admitted. Of these latter,\nthose who doubt, are your mere doubters by profession\u2014an unprofitable\nand disreputable tribe. There can be no more absolute waste of time\nthan the attempt to _prove_, at the present day, that man, by mere\nexercise of will, can so impress his fellow, as to cast him into an\nabnormal condition, of which the phenomena resemble very closely those\nof _death_, or at least resemble them more nearly than they do the\nphenomena of any other normal condition within our cognizance; that,\nwhile in this state, the person so impressed employs only with effort,\nand then feebly, the external organs of sense, yet perceives, with\nkeenly refined perception, and through channels supposed unknown,\nmatters beyond the scope of the physical organs; that, moreover, his\nintellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted and invigorated; that\nhis sympathies with the person so impressing him are profound; and,\nfinally, that his susceptibility to the impression increases with its\nfrequency, while, in the same proportion, the peculiar phenomena\nelicited are more extended and more _pronounced_.\n\nI say that these\u2014which are the laws of mesmerism in its general\nfeatures\u2014it would be supererogation to demonstrate; nor shall I inflict\nupon my readers so needless a demonstration; to-day. My purpose at\npresent is a very different one indeed. I am impelled, even in the\nteeth of a world of prejudice, to detail without comment the very\nremarkable substance of a colloquy, occurring between a sleep-waker and\nmyself.\n\nI had been long in the habit of mesmerizing the person in question (Mr.\nVankirk), and the usual acute susceptibility and exaltation of the\nmesmeric perception had supervened. For many months he had been\nlaboring under confirmed phthisis, the more distressing effects of\nwhich had been relieved by my manipulations; and on the night of\nWednesday, the fifteenth instant, I was summoned to his bedside.\n\nThe invalid was suffering with acute pain in the region of the heart,\nand breathed with great difficulty, having all the ordinary symptoms of\nasthma. In spasms such as these he had usually found relief from the\napplication of mustard to the nervous centres, but to-night this had\nbeen attempted in vain.\n\nAs I entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile, and although\nevidently in much bodily pain, appeared to be, mentally, quite at ease.\n\n\u201cI sent for you to-night,\u201d he said, \u201cnot so much to administer to my\nbodily ailment, as to satisfy me concerning certain psychal impressions\nwhich, of late, have occasioned me much anxiety and surprise. I need\nnot tell you how sceptical I have hitherto been on the topic of the\nsoul\u2019s immortality. I cannot deny that there has always existed, as if\nin that very soul which I have been denying, a vague half-sentiment of\nits own existence. But this half-sentiment at no time amounted to\nconviction. With it my reason had nothing to do. All attempts at\nlogical inquiry resulted, indeed, in leaving me more sceptical than\nbefore. I had been advised to study Cousin. I studied him in his own\nworks as well as in those of his European and American echoes. The\n\u2018Charles Elwood\u2019 of Mr. Brownson, for example, was placed in my hands.\nI read it with profound attention. Throughout I found it logical, but\nthe portions which were not _merely_ logical were unhappily the initial\narguments of the disbelieving hero of the book. In his summing up it\nseemed evident to me that the reasoner had not even succeeded in\nconvincing himself. His end had plainly forgotten his beginning, like\nthe government of Trinculo. In short, I was not long in perceiving that\nif man is to be intellectually convinced of his own immortality, he\nwill never be so convinced by the mere abstractions which have been so\nlong the fashion of the moralists of England, of France, and of\nGermany. Abstractions may amuse and exercise, but take no hold on the\nmind. Here upon earth, at least, philosophy, I am persuaded, will\nalways in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things. The will\nmay assent\u2014the soul\u2014the intellect, never.\n\n\u201cI repeat, then, that I only half felt, and never intellectually\nbelieved. But latterly there has been a certain deepening of the\nfeeling, until it has come so nearly to resemble the acquiescence of\nreason, that I find it difficult to distinguish between the two. I am\nenabled, too, plainly to trace this effect to the mesmeric influence. I\ncannot better explain my meaning than by the hypothesis that the\nmesmeric exaltation enables me to perceive a train of ratiocination\nwhich, in my abnormal existence, convinces, but which, in full\naccordance with the mesmeric phenomena, does not extend, except through\nits _effect_, into my normal condition. In sleep-waking, the reasoning\nand its conclusion\u2014the cause and its effect\u2014are present together. In my\nnatural state, the cause vanishing, the effect only, and perhaps only\npartially, remains.\n\n\u201cThese considerations have led me to think that some good results might\nensue from a series of well-directed questions propounded to me while\nmesmerized. You have often observed the profound self-cognizance\nevinced by the sleep-waker\u2014the extensive knowledge he displays upon all\npoints relating to the mesmeric condition itself; and from this\nself-cognizance may be deduced hints for the proper conduct of a\ncatechism.\u201d\n\nI consented of course to make this experiment.  A few passes threw Mr.\nVankirk into the mesmeric sleep. His breathing became immediately more\neasy, and he seemed to suffer no physical uneasiness. The following\nconversation then ensued:\u2014V. in the dialogue representing the patient,\nand P. myself.\n\n      _P._ Are you asleep?\n\n      _V._ Yes\u2014no; I would rather sleep more soundly.\n\n      _P._ [_After a few more passes._] Do you sleep now?\n\n      _V._ Yes.\n\n      _P._ How do you think your present illness will result?\n\n      _V._ [_After a long hesitation and speaking as if with effort_.]\n      I must die.\n\n      _P._ Does the idea of death afflict you?\n\n      _V._ [_Very quickly_.] No\u2014no!\n\n      _P._ Are you pleased with the prospect?\n\n      _V._ If I were awake I should like to die, but now it is no\n      matter. The mesmeric condition is so near death as to content me.\n\n      _P._ I wish you would explain yourself, Mr. Vankirk.\n\n      _V._ I am willing to do so, but it requires more effort than I\n      feel able to make. You do not question me properly.\n\n      _P._ What then shall I ask?\n\n      _V._ You must begin at the beginning.\n\n      _P._ The beginning! But where is the beginning?\n\n      _V._ You know that the beginning is GOD. [_This was said in a\n      low, fluctuating tone, and with every sign of the most profound\n      veneration_.]\n\n      _P._ What then, is God?\n\n      _V._ [_Hesitating for many minutes._] I cannot tell.\n\n      _P._ Is not God spirit?\n\n      _V._ While I was awake I knew what you meant by \u201cspirit,\u201d but now\n      it seems only a word\u2014such, for instance, as truth, beauty\u2014a\n      quality, I mean.\n\n      _P._ Is not God immaterial?\n\n      _V._ There is no immateriality\u2014it is a mere word. That which is\n      not matter, is not at all\u2014unless qualities are things.\n\n      _P._ Is God, then, material?\n\n      _V._ No. [_This reply startled me very much._]\n\n      _P._ What, then, is he?\n\n      _V._ [_After a long pause, and mutteringly._] I see\u2014but it is a\n      thing difficult to tell. [_Another long pause._] He is not\n      spirit, for he exists. Nor is he matter, as _you understand it_.\n      But there are _gradations_ of matter of which man knows nothing;\n      the grosser impelling the finer, the finer pervading the grosser.\n      The atmosphere, for example, impels the electric principle, while\n      the electric principle permeates the atmosphere. These gradations\n      of matter increase in rarity or fineness, until we arrive at a\n      matter _unparticled_\u2014without particles\u2014indivisible\u2014_one;_ and\n      here the law of impulsion and permeation is modified. The\n      ultimate, or unparticled matter, not only permeates all things\n      but impels all things; and thus _is_ all things within itself.\n      This matter is God. What men attempt to embody in the word\n      \u201cthought,\u201d is this matter in motion.\n\n      _P._ The metaphysicians maintain that all action is reducible to\n      motion and thinking, and that the latter is the origin of the\n      former.\n\n      _V._ Yes; and I now see the confusion of idea. Motion is the\n      action of _mind_, not of _thinking_. The unparticled matter, or\n      God, in quiescence, is (as nearly as we can conceive it) what men\n      call mind. And the power of self-movement (equivalent in effect\n      to human volition) is, in the unparticled matter, the result of\n      its unity and omniprevalence; _how_ I know not, and now clearly\n      see that I shall never know. But the unparticled matter, set in\n      motion by a law, or quality, existing within itself, is thinking.\n\n      _P._ Can you give me no more precise idea of what you term the\n      unparticled matter?\n\n      _V._ The matters of which man is cognizant escape the senses in\n      gradation. We have, for example, a metal, a piece of wood, a drop\n      of water, the atmosphere, a gas, caloric, electricity, the\n      luminiferous ether. Now we call all these things matter, and\n      embrace all matter in one general definition; but in spite of\n      this, there can be no two ideas more essentially distinct than\n      that which we attach to a metal, and that which we attach to the\n      luminiferous ether. When we reach the latter, we feel an almost\n      irresistible inclination to class it with spirit, or with\n      nihility. The only consideration which restrains us is our\n      conception of its atomic constitution; and here, even, we have to\n      seek aid from our notion of an atom, as something possessing in\n      infinite minuteness, solidity, palpability, weight. Destroy the\n      idea of the atomic constitution and we should no longer be able\n      to regard the ether as an entity, or at least as matter. For want\n      of a better word we might term it spirit. Take, now, a step\n      beyond the luminiferous ether\u2014conceive a matter as much more rare\n      than the ether, as this ether is more rare than the metal, and we\n      arrive at once (in spite of all the school dogmas) at a unique\n      mass\u2014an unparticled matter. For although we may admit infinite\n      littleness in the atoms themselves, the infinitude of littleness\n      in the spaces between them is an absurdity. There will be a\n      point\u2014there will be a degree of rarity, at which, if the atoms\n      are sufficiently numerous, the interspaces must vanish, and the\n      mass absolutely coalesce. But the consideration of the atomic\n      constitution being now taken away, the nature of the mass\n      inevitably glides into what we conceive of spirit. It is clear,\n      however, that it is as fully matter as before. The truth is, it\n      is impossible to conceive spirit, since it is impossible to\n      imagine what is not. When we flatter ourselves that we have\n      formed its conception, we have merely deceived our understanding\n      by the consideration of infinitely rarified matter.\n\n      _P._ There seems to me an insurmountable objection to the idea of\n      absolute coalescence;\u2014and that is the very slight resistance\n      experienced by the heavenly bodies in their revolutions through\n      space\u2014a resistance now ascertained, it is true, to exist in\n      _some_ degree, but which is, nevertheless, so slight as to have\n      been quite overlooked by the sagacity even of Newton. We know\n      that the resistance of bodies is, chiefly, in proportion to their\n      density. Absolute coalescence is absolute density. Where there\n      are no interspaces, there can be no yielding. An ether,\n      absolutely dense, would put an infinitely more effectual stop to\n      the progress of a star than would an ether of adamant or of iron.\n\n      _V._ Your objection is answered with an ease which is nearly in\n      the ratio of its apparent unanswerability.\u2014As regards the\n      progress of the star, it can make no difference whether the star\n      passes through the ether _or the ether through it_. There is no\n      astronomical error more unaccountable than that which reconciles\n      the known retardation of the comets with the idea of their\n      passage through an ether: for, however rare this ether be\n      supposed, it would put a stop to all sidereal revolution in a\n      very far briefer period than has been admitted by those\n      astronomers who have endeavored to slur over a point which they\n      found it impossible to comprehend. The retardation actually\n      experienced is, on the other hand, about that which might be\n      expected from the _friction_ of the ether in the instantaneous\n      passage through the orb. In the one case, the retarding force is\n      momentary and complete within itself\u2014in the other it is endlessly\n      accumulative.\n\n      _P._ But in all this\u2014in this identification of mere matter with\n      God\u2014is there nothing of irreverence? [_I was forced to repeat\n      this question before the sleep-waker fully comprehended my\n      meaning_.]\n\n      _V._ Can you say _why_ matter should be less reverenced than\n      mind? But you forget that the matter of which I speak is, in all\n      respects, the very \u201cmind\u201d or \u201cspirit\u201d of the schools, so far as\n      regards its high capacities, and is, moreover, the \u201cmatter\u201d of\n      these schools at the same time. God, with all the powers\n      attributed to spirit, is but the perfection of matter.\n\n      _P._ You assert, then, that the unparticled matter, in motion, is\n      thought?\n\n      _V._ In general, this motion is the universal thought of the\n      universal mind. This thought creates. All created things are but\n      the thoughts of God.\n\n      _P._ You say, \u201cin general.\u201d\n\n      _V._ Yes. The universal mind is God. For new individualities,\n      _matter_ is necessary.\n\n      _P._ But you now speak of \u201cmind\u201d and \u201cmatter\u201d as do the\n      metaphysicians.\n\n      _V._ Yes\u2014to avoid confusion. When I say \u201cmind,\u201d I mean the\n      unparticled or ultimate matter; by \u201cmatter,\u201d I intend all else.\n\n      _P._ You were saying that \u201cfor new individualities matter is\n      necessary.\u201d\n\n      _V._ Yes; for mind, existing unincorporate, is merely God. To\n      create individual, thinking beings, it was necessary to incarnate\n      portions of the divine mind. Thus man is individualized. Divested\n      of corporate investiture, he were God. Now, the particular motion\n      of the incarnated portions of the unparticled matter is the\n      thought of man; as the motion of the whole is that of God.\n\n      _P._ You say that divested of the body man will be God?\n\n      _V._ [_After much hesitation._] I could not have said this; it is\n      an absurdity.\n\n      _P._ [_Referring to my notes._] You _did_ say that \u201cdivested of\n      corporate investiture man were God.\u201d\n\n      _V._ And this is true. Man thus divested _would be_ God\u2014would be\n      unindividualized. But he can never be thus divested\u2014at least\n      never _will be_\u2014else we must imagine an action of God returning\n      upon itself\u2014a purposeless and futile action. Man is a creature.\n      Creatures are thoughts of God. It is the nature of thought to be\n      irrevocable.\n\n      _P._ I do not comprehend. You say that man will never put off the\n      body?\n\n      _V._ I say that he will never be bodiless.\n\n      _P._ Explain.\n\n      _V._ There are two bodies\u2014the rudimental and the complete;\n      corresponding with the two conditions of the worm and the\n      butterfly. What we call \u201cdeath,\u201d is but the painful\n      metamorphosis. Our present incarnation is progressive,\n      preparatory, temporary. Our future is perfected, ultimate,\n      immortal. The ultimate life is the full design.\n\n      _P._ But of the worm\u2019s metamorphosis we are palpably cognizant.\n\n      _V._ _We_, certainly\u2014but not the worm. The matter of which our\n      rudimental body is composed, is within the ken of the organs of\n      that body; or, more distinctly, our rudimental organs are adapted\n      to the matter of which is formed the rudimental body; but not to\n      that of which the ultimate is composed. The ultimate body thus\n      escapes our rudimental senses, and we perceive only the shell\n      which falls, in decaying, from the inner form; not that inner\n      form itself; but this inner form, as well as the shell, is\n      appreciable by those who have already acquired the ultimate life.\n\n      _P._ You have often said that the mesmeric state very nearly\n      resembles death. How is this?\n\n      _V._ When I say that it resembles death, I mean that it resembles\n      the ultimate life; for when I am entranced the senses of my\n      rudimental life are in abeyance, and I perceive external things\n      directly, without organs, through a medium which I shall employ\n      in the ultimate, unorganized life.\n\n      _P._ Unorganized?\n\n      _V._ Yes; organs are contrivances by which the individual is\n      brought into sensible relation with particular classes and forms\n      of matter, to the exclusion of other classes and forms. The\n      organs of man are adapted to his rudimental condition, and to\n      that only; his ultimate condition, being unorganized, is of\n      unlimited comprehension in all points but one\u2014the nature of the\n      volition of God\u2014that is to say, the motion of the unparticled\n      matter. You will have a distinct idea of the ultimate body by\n      conceiving it to be entire brain. This it is _not_; but a\n      conception of this nature will bring you near a comprehension of\n      what it _is_. A luminous body imparts vibration to the\n      luminiferous ether. The vibrations generate similar ones within\n      the retina; these again communicate similar ones to the optic\n      nerve. The nerve conveys similar ones to the brain; the brain,\n      also, similar ones to the unparticled matter which permeates it.\n      The motion of this latter is thought, of which perception is the\n      first undulation. This is the mode by which the mind of the\n      rudimental life communicates with the external world; and this\n      external world is, to the rudimental life, limited, through the\n      idiosyncrasy of its organs. But in the ultimate, unorganized\n      life, the external world reaches the whole body, (which is of a\n      substance having affinity to brain, as I have said,) with no\n      other intervention than that of an infinitely rarer ether than\n      even the luminiferous; and to this ether\u2014in unison with it\u2014the\n      whole body vibrates, setting in motion the unparticled matter\n      which permeates it. It is to the absence of idiosyncratic organs,\n      therefore, that we must attribute the nearly unlimited perception\n      of the ultimate life. To rudimental beings, organs are the cages\n      necessary to confine them until fledged.\n\n      _P._ You speak of rudimental \u201cbeings.\u201d Are there other rudimental\n      thinking beings than man?\n\n      _V._ The multitudinous conglomeration of rare matter into nebul\u00e6,\n      planets, suns, and other bodies which are neither nebul\u00e6, suns,\n      nor planets, is for the sole purpose of supplying _pabulum_ for\n      the idiosyncrasy of the organs of an infinity of rudimental\n      beings. But for the necessity of the rudimental, prior to the\n      ultimate life, there would have been no bodies such as these.\n      Each of these is tenanted by a distinct variety of organic,\n      rudimental, thinking creatures. In all, the organs vary with the\n      features of the place tenanted. At death, or metamorphosis, these\n      creatures, enjoying the ultimate life\u2014immortality\u2014and cognizant\n      of all secrets but _the one_, act all things and pass everywhere\n      by mere volition:\u2014indwelling, not the stars, which to us seem the\n      sole palpabilities, and for the accommodation of which we blindly\n      deem space created\u2014but that SPACE itself\u2014that infinity of which\n      the truly substantive vastness swallows up the\n      star-shadows\u2014blotting them out as non-entities from the\n      perception of the angels.\n\n      _P._ You say that \u201cbut for the _necessity_ of the rudimental\n      life\u201d there would have been no stars. But why this necessity?\n\n      _V._ In the inorganic life, as well as in the inorganic matter\n      generally, there is nothing to impede the action of one simple\n      _unique_ law\u2014the Divine Volition. With the view of producing\n      impediment, the organic life and matter, (complex, substantial,\n      and law-encumbered,) were contrived.\n\n      _P._ But again\u2014why need this impediment have been produced?\n\n      _V._ The result of law inviolate is perfection\u2014right\u2014negative\n      happiness. The result of law violate is imperfection, wrong,\n      positive pain. Through the impediments afforded by the number,\n      complexity, and substantiality of the laws of organic life and\n      matter, the violation of law is rendered, to a certain extent,\n      practicable. Thus pain, which in the inorganic life is\n      impossible, is possible in the organic.\n\n      _P._ But to what good end is pain thus rendered possible?\n\n      _V._ All things are either good or bad by comparison. A\n      sufficient analysis will show that pleasure, in all cases, is but\n      the contrast of pain. _Positive_ pleasure is a mere idea. To be\n      happy at any one point we must have suffered at the same. Never\n      to suffer would have been never to have been blessed. But it has\n      been shown that, in the inorganic life, pain cannot be thus the\n      necessity for the organic. The pain of the primitive life of\n      Earth, is the sole basis of the bliss of the ultimate life in\n      Heaven.\n\n      _P._ Still, there is one of your expressions which I find it\n      impossible to comprehend\u2014\u201cthe truly _substantive_ vastness of\n      infinity.\u201d\n\n      _V._ This, probably, is because you have no sufficiently generic\n      conception of the term \u201c_substance_\u201d itself. We must not regard\n      it as a quality, but as a sentiment:\u2014it is the perception, in\n      thinking beings, of the adaptation of matter to their\n      organization. There are many things on the Earth, which would be\n      nihility to the inhabitants of Venus\u2014many things visible and\n      tangible in Venus, which we could not be brought to appreciate as\n      existing at all. But to the inorganic beings\u2014to the angels\u2014the\n      whole of the unparticled matter is substance\u2014that is to say, the\n      whole of what we term \u201cspace\u201d is to them the truest\n      substantiality;\u2014the stars, meantime, through what we consider\n      their materiality, escaping the angelic sense, just in proportion\n      as the unparticled matter, through what we consider its\n      immateriality, eludes the organic.\n\n      As the sleep-waker pronounced these latter words, in a feeble\n      tone, I observed on his countenance a singular expression, which\n      somewhat alarmed me, and induced me to awake him at once. No\n      sooner had I done this, than, with a bright smile irradiating all\n      his features, he fell back upon his pillow and expired. I noticed\n      that in less than a minute afterward his corpse had all the stern\n      rigidity of stone. His brow was of the coldness of ice. Thus,\n      ordinarily, should it have appeared, only after long pressure\n      from Azrael\u2019s hand. Had the sleep-waker, indeed, during the\n      latter portion of his discourse, been addressing me from out the\n      region of the shadows?\n\n\n\n\nTHE FACTS IN THE CASE OF M. VALDEMAR\n\n\n      Of course I shall not pretend to consider it any matter for\n      wonder, that the extraordinary case of M. Valdemar has excited\n      discussion. It would have been a miracle had it not\u2014especially\n      under the circumstances. Through the desire of all parties\n      concerned, to keep the affair from the public, at least for the\n      present, or until we had farther opportunities for\n      investigation\u2014through our endeavors to effect this\u2014a garbled or\n      exaggerated account made its way into society, and became the\n      source of many unpleasant misrepresentations; and, very\n      naturally, of a great deal of disbelief.\n\n      It is now rendered necessary that I give the facts\u2014as far as I\n      comprehend them myself. They are, succinctly, these:\n\n      My attention, for the last three years, had been repeatedly drawn\n      to the subject of Mesmerism; and, about nine months ago it\n      occurred to me, quite suddenly, that in the series of experiments\n      made hitherto, there had been a very remarkable and most\n      unaccountable omission:\u2014no person had as yet been mesmerized in\n      articulo mortis. It remained to be seen, first, whether, in such\n      condition, there existed in the patient any susceptibility to the\n      magnetic influence; secondly, whether, if any existed, it was\n      impaired or increased by the condition; thirdly, to what extent,\n      or for how long a period, the encroachments of Death might be\n      arrested by the process. There were other points to be\n      ascertained, but these most excited my curiosity\u2014the last in\n      especial, from the immensely important character of its\n      consequences.\n\n      In looking around me for some subject by whose means I might test\n      these particulars, I was brought to think of my friend, M. Ernest\n      Valdemar, the well-known compiler of the \u201cBibliotheca Forensica,\u201d\n      and author (under the nom de plume of Issachar Marx) of the\n      Polish versions of \u201cWallenstein\u201d and \u201cGargantua.\u201d M. Valdemar,\n      who has resided principally at Harlem, N.Y., since the year 1839,\n      is (or was) particularly noticeable for the extreme spareness of\n      his person\u2014his lower limbs much resembling those of John\n      Randolph; and, also, for the whiteness of his whiskers, in\n      violent contrast to the blackness of his hair\u2014the latter, in\n      consequence, being very generally mistaken for a wig. His\n      temperament was markedly nervous, and rendered him a good subject\n      for mesmeric experiment. On two or three occasions I had put him\n      to sleep with little difficulty, but was disappointed in other\n      results which his peculiar constitution had naturally led me to\n      anticipate. His will was at no period positively, or thoroughly,\n      under my control, and in regard to clairvoyance, I could\n      accomplish with him nothing to be relied upon. I always\n      attributed my failure at these points to the disordered state of\n      his health. For some months previous to my becoming acquainted\n      with him, his physicians had declared him in a confirmed\n      phthisis. It was his custom, indeed, to speak calmly of his\n      approaching dissolution, as of a matter neither to be avoided nor\n      regretted.\n\n      When the ideas to which I have alluded first occurred to me, it\n      was of course very natural that I should think of M. Valdemar. I\n      knew the steady philosophy of the man too well to apprehend any\n      scruples from him; and he had no relatives in America who would\n      be likely to interfere. I spoke to him frankly upon the subject;\n      and, to my surprise, his interest seemed vividly excited. I say\n      to my surprise, for, although he had always yielded his person\n      freely to my experiments, he had never before given me any tokens\n      of sympathy with what I did. His disease was of that character\n      which would admit of exact calculation in respect to the epoch of\n      its termination in death; and it was finally arranged between us\n      that he would send for me about twenty-four hours before the\n      period announced by his physicians as that of his decease.\n\n      It is now rather more than seven months since I received, from M.\n      Valdemar himself, the subjoined note:\n\n      MY DEAR P\u2014\u2014,\n\n      You may as well come now. D\u2014\u2014 and F\u2014\u2014 are agreed that I cannot\n      hold out beyond to-morrow midnight; and I think they have hit the\n      time very nearly.\n\n      VALDEMAR\n\n      I received this note within half an hour after it was written,\n      and in fifteen minutes more I was in the dying man\u2019s chamber. I\n      had not seen him for ten days, and was appalled by the fearful\n      alteration which the brief interval had wrought in him. His face\n      wore a leaden hue; the eyes were utterly lustreless; and the\n      emaciation was so extreme that the skin had been broken through\n      by the cheek-bones. His expectoration was excessive. The pulse\n      was barely perceptible. He retained, nevertheless, in a very\n      remarkable manner, both his mental power and a certain degree of\n      physical strength. He spoke with distinctness\u2014took some\n      palliative medicines without aid\u2014and, when I entered the room,\n      was occupied in penciling memoranda in a pocket-book. He was\n      propped up in the bed by pillows. Doctors D\u2014\u2014 and F\u2014\u2014 were in\n      attendance.\n\n      After pressing Valdemar\u2019s hand, I took these gentlemen aside, and\n      obtained from them a minute account of the patient\u2019s condition.\n      The left lung had been for eighteen months in a semi-osseous or\n      cartilaginous state, and was, of course, entirely useless for all\n      purposes of vitality. The right, in its upper portion, was also\n      partially, if not thoroughly, ossified, while the lower region\n      was merely a mass of purulent tubercles, running one into\n      another. Several extensive perforations existed; and, at one\n      point, permanent adhesion to the ribs had taken place. These\n      appearances in the right lobe were of comparatively recent date.\n      The ossification had proceeded with very unusual rapidity; no\n      sign of it had been discovered a month before, and the adhesion\n      had only been observed during the three previous days.\n      Independently of the phthisis, the patient was suspected of\n      aneurism of the aorta; but on this point the osseous symptoms\n      rendered an exact diagnosis impossible. It was the opinion of\n      both physicians that M. Valdemar would die about midnight on the\n      morrow (Sunday). It was then seven o\u2019clock on Saturday evening.\n\n      On quitting the invalid\u2019s bed-side to hold conversation with\n      myself, Doctors D\u2014\u2014 and F\u2014\u2014 had bidden him a final farewell. It\n      had not been their intention to return; but, at my request, they\n      agreed to look in upon the patient about ten the next night.\n\n      When they had gone, I spoke freely with M. Valdemar on the\n      subject of his approaching dissolution, as well as, more\n      particularly, of the experiment proposed. He still professed\n      himself quite willing and even anxious to have it made, and urged\n      me to commence it at once. A male and a female nurse were in\n      attendance; but I did not feel myself altogether at liberty to\n      engage in a task of this character with no more reliable\n      witnesses than these people, in case of sudden accident, might\n      prove. I therefore postponed operations until about eight the\n      next night, when the arrival of a medical student with whom I had\n      some acquaintance, (Mr. Theodore L\u2014l,) relieved me from farther\n      embarrassment. It had been my design, originally, to wait for the\n      physicians; but I was induced to proceed, first, by the urgent\n      entreaties of M. Valdemar, and secondly, by my conviction that I\n      had not a moment to lose, as he was evidently sinking fast.\n\n      Mr. L\u2014l was so kind as to accede to my desire that he would take\n      notes of all that occurred, and it is from his memoranda that\n      what I now have to relate is, for the most part, either condensed\n      or copied verbatim.\n\n      It wanted about five minutes of eight when, taking the patient\u2019s\n      hand, I begged him to state, as distinctly as he could, to Mr.\n      L\u2014l, whether he (M. Valdemar) was entirely willing that I should\n      make the experiment of mesmerizing him in his then condition.\n\n      He replied feebly, yet quite audibly, \u201cYes, I wish to be. I fear\n      you have mesmerized\u201d\u2014adding immediately afterwards: \u201cI fear you\n      have deferred it too long.\u201d\n\n      While he spoke thus, I commenced the passes which I had already\n      found most effectual in subduing him. He was evidently influenced\n      with the first lateral stroke of my hand across his forehead; but\n      although I exerted all my powers, no further perceptible effect\n      was induced until some minutes after ten o\u2019clock, when Doctors\n      D\u2014\u2014 and F\u2014\u2014 called, according to appointment. I explained to\n      them, in a few words, what I designed, and as they opposed no\n      objection, saying that the patient was already in the death\n      agony, I proceeded without hesitation\u2014exchanging, however, the\n      lateral passes for downward ones, and directing my gaze entirely\n      into the right eye of the sufferer.\n\n      By this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was\n      stertorous, and at intervals of half a minute.\n\n      This condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour. At\n      the expiration of this period, however, a natural although a very\n      deep sigh escaped the bosom of the dying man, and the stertorous\n      breathing ceased\u2014that is to say, its stertorousness was no longer\n      apparent; the intervals were undiminished. The patient\u2019s\n      extremities were of an icy coldness.\n\n      At five minutes before eleven I perceived unequivocal signs of\n      the mesmeric influence. The glassy roll of the eye was changed\n      for that expression of uneasy inward examination which is never\n      seen except in cases of sleep-waking, and which it is quite\n      impossible to mistake. With a few rapid lateral passes I made the\n      lids quiver, as in incipient sleep, and with a few more I closed\n      them altogether. I was not satisfied, however, with this, but\n      continued the manipulations vigorously, and with the fullest\n      exertion of the will, until I had completely stiffened the limbs\n      of the slumberer, after placing them in a seemingly easy\n      position. The legs were at full length; the arms were nearly so,\n      and reposed on the bed at a moderate distance from the loin. The\n      head was very slightly elevated.\n\n      When I had accomplished this, it was fully midnight, and I\n      requested the gentlemen present to examine M. Valdemar\u2019s\n      condition. After a few experiments, they admitted him to be an\n      unusually perfect state of mesmeric trance. The curiosity of both\n      the physicians was greatly excited. Dr. D\u2014\u2014 resolved at once to\n      remain with the patient all night, while Dr. F\u2014\u2014 took leave with\n      a promise to return at daybreak. Mr. L\u2014l and the nurses remained.\n\n      We left M. Valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three\n      o\u2019clock in the morning, when I approached him and found him in\n      precisely the same condition as when Dr. F\u2014\u2014 went away\u2014that is to\n      say, he lay in the same position; the pulse was imperceptible;\n      the breathing was gentle (scarcely noticeable, unless through the\n      application of a mirror to the lips); the eyes were closed\n      naturally; and the limbs were as rigid and as cold as marble.\n      Still, the general appearance was certainly not that of death.\n\n      As I approached M. Valdemar I made a kind of half effort to\n      influence his right arm into pursuit of my own, as I passed the\n      latter gently to and fro above his person. In such experiments\n      with this patient, I had never perfectly succeeded before, and\n      assuredly I had little thought of succeeding now; but to my\n      astonishment, his arm very readily, although feebly, followed\n      every direction I assigned it with mine. I determined to hazard a\n      few words of conversation.\n\n      \u201cM. Valdemar,\u201d I said, \u201care you asleep?\u201d He made no answer, but I\n      perceived a tremor about the lips, and was thus induced to repeat\n      the question, again and again. At its third repetition, his whole\n      frame was agitated by a very slight shivering; the eyelids\n      unclosed themselves so far as to display a white line of the\n      ball; the lips moved sluggishly, and from between them, in a\n      barely audible whisper, issued the words:\n\n      \u201cYes;\u2014asleep now. Do not wake me!\u2014let me die so!\u201d\n\n      I here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever. The right\n      arm, as before, obeyed the direction of my hand. I questioned the\n      sleep-waker again:\n\n      \u201cDo you still feel pain in the breast, M. Valdemar?\u201d\n\n      The answer now was immediate, but even less audible than before:\n\n      \u201cNo pain\u2014I am dying.\u201d\n\n      I did not think it advisable to disturb him farther just then,\n      and nothing more was said or done until the arrival of Dr. F\u2014\u2014,\n      who came a little before sunrise, and expressed unbounded\n      astonishment at finding the patient still alive. After feeling\n      the pulse and applying a mirror to the lips, he requested me to\n      speak to the sleep-waker again. I did so, saying:\n\n      \u201cM. Valdemar, do you still sleep?\u201d\n\n      As before, some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made; and during\n      the interval the dying man seemed to be collecting his energies\n      to speak. At my fourth repetition of the question, he said very\n      faintly, almost inaudibly:\n\n      \u201cYes; still asleep\u2014dying.\u201d\n\n      It was now the opinion, or rather the wish, of the physicians,\n      that M. Valdemar should be suffered to remain undisturbed in his\n      present apparently tranquil condition, until death should\n      supervene\u2014and this, it was generally agreed, must now take place\n      within a few minutes. I concluded, however, to speak to him once\n      more, and merely repeated my previous question.\n\n      While I spoke, there came a marked change over the countenance of\n      the sleep-waker. The eyes rolled themselves slowly open, the\n      pupils disappearing upwardly; the skin generally assumed a\n      cadaverous hue, resembling not so much parchment as white paper;\n      and the circular hectic spots which, hitherto, had been strongly\n      defined in the centre of each cheek, went out at once. I use this\n      expression, because the suddenness of their departure put me in\n      mind of nothing so much as the extinguishment of a candle by a\n      puff of the breath. The upper lip, at the same time, writhed\n      itself away from the teeth, which it had previously covered\n      completely; while the lower jaw fell with an audible jerk,\n      leaving the mouth widely extended, and disclosing in full view\n      the swollen and blackened tongue. I presume that no member of the\n      party then present had been unaccustomed to death-bed horrors;\n      but so hideous beyond conception was the appearance of M.\n      Valdemar at this moment, that there was a general shrinking back\n      from the region of the bed.\n\n      I now feel that I have reached a point of this narrative at which\n      every reader will be startled into positive disbelief. It is my\n      business, however, simply to proceed.\n\n      There was no longer the faintest sign of vitality in M. Valdemar;\n      and concluding him to be dead, we were consigning him to the\n      charge of the nurses, when a strong vibratory motion was\n      observable in the tongue. This continued for perhaps a minute. At\n      the expiration of this period, there issued from the distended\n      and motionless jaws a voice\u2014such as it would be madness in me to\n      attempt describing. There are, indeed, two or three epithets\n      which might be considered as applicable to it in part; I might\n      say, for example, that the sound was harsh, and broken and\n      hollow; but the hideous whole is indescribable, for the simple\n      reason that no similar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of\n      humanity. There were two particulars, nevertheless, which I\n      thought then, and still think, might fairly be stated as\n      characteristic of the intonation\u2014as well adapted to convey some\n      idea of its unearthly peculiarity. In the first place, the voice\n      seemed to reach our ears\u2014at least mine\u2014from a vast distance, or\n      from some deep cavern within the earth. In the second place, it\n      impressed me (I fear, indeed, that it will be impossible to make\n      myself comprehended) as gelatinous or glutinous matters impress\n      the sense of touch.\n\n      I have spoken both of \u201csound\u201d and of \u201cvoice.\u201d I mean to say that\n      the sound was one of distinct\u2014of even wonderfully, thrillingly\n      distinct\u2014syllabification. M. Valdemar spoke\u2014obviously in reply to\n      the question I had propounded to him a few minutes before. I had\n      asked him, it will be remembered, if he still slept. He now said:\n\n      \u201cYes;\u2014no;\u2014I have been sleeping\u2014and now\u2014now\u2014I am dead.\u201d\n\n      No person present even affected to deny, or attempted to repress,\n      the unutterable, shuddering horror which these few words, thus\n      uttered, were so well calculated to convey. Mr. L\u2014l (the student)\n      swooned. The nurses immediately left the chamber, and could not\n      be induced to return. My own impressions I would not pretend to\n      render intelligible to the reader. For nearly an hour, we busied\n      ourselves, silently\u2014without the utterance of a word\u2014in endeavors\n      to revive Mr. L\u2014l. When he came to himself, we addressed\n      ourselves again to an investigation of M. Valdemar\u2019s condition.\n\n      It remained in all respects as I have last described it, with the\n      exception that the mirror no longer afforded evidence of\n      respiration. An attempt to draw blood from the arm failed. I\n      should mention, too, that this limb was no farther subject to my\n      will. I endeavored in vain to make it follow the direction of my\n      hand. The only real indication, indeed, of the mesmeric\n      influence, was now found in the vibratory movement of the tongue,\n      whenever I addressed M. Valdemar a question. He seemed to be\n      making an effort to reply, but had no longer sufficient volition.\n      To queries put to him by any other person than myself he seemed\n      utterly insensible\u2014although I endeavored to place each member of\n      the company in mesmeric rapport with him. I believe that I have\n      now related all that is necessary to an understanding of the\n      sleep-waker\u2019s state at this epoch. Other nurses were procured;\n      and at ten o\u2019clock I left the house in company with the two\n      physicians and Mr. L\u2014l.\n\n      In the afternoon we all called again to see the patient. His\n      condition remained precisely the same. We had now some discussion\n      as to the propriety and feasibility of awakening him; but we had\n      little difficulty in agreeing that no good purpose would be\n      served by so doing. It was evident that, so far, death (or what\n      is usually termed death) had been arrested by the mesmeric\n      process. It seemed clear to us all that to awaken M. Valdemar\n      would be merely to insure his instant, or at least his speedy,\n      dissolution.\n\n      From this period until the close of last week\u2014an interval of\n      nearly seven months\u2014we continued to make daily calls at M.\n      Valdemar\u2019s house, accompanied, now and then, by medical and other\n      friends. All this time the sleeper-waker remained _exactly_ as I\n      have last described him. The nurses\u2019 attentions were continual.\n\n      It was on Friday last that we finally resolved to make the\n      experiment of awakening, or attempting to awaken him; and it is\n      the (perhaps) unfortunate result of this latter experiment which\n      has given rise to so much discussion in private circles\u2014to so\n      much of what I cannot help thinking unwarranted popular feeling.\n\n      For the purpose of relieving M. Valdemar from the mesmeric\n      trance, I made use of the customary passes. These, for a time,\n      were unsuccessful. The first indication of revival was afforded\n      by a partial descent of the iris. It was observed, as especially\n      remarkable, that this lowering of the pupil was accompanied by\n      the profuse out-flowing of a yellowish ichor (from beneath the\n      lids) of a pungent and highly offensive odor.\n\n      It was now suggested that I should attempt to influence the\n      patient\u2019s arm, as heretofore. I made the attempt and failed. Dr.\n      F\u2014\u2014 then intimated a desire to have me put a question. I did so,\n      as follows:\n\n      \u201cM. Valdemar, can you explain to us what are your feelings or\n      wishes now?\u201d\n\n      There was an instant return of the hectic circles on the cheeks;\n      the tongue quivered, or rather rolled violently in the mouth\n      (although the jaws and lips remained rigid as before), and at\n      length the same hideous voice which I have already described,\n      broke forth:\n\n      \u201cFor God\u2019s sake!\u2014quick!\u2014quick!\u2014put me to sleep\u2014or, quick!\u2014waken\n      me!\u2014quick!\u2014I say to you that I am dead!\u201d\n\n      I was thoroughly unnerved, and for an instant remained undecided\n      what to do. At first I made an endeavor to recompose the patient;\n      but, failing in this through total abeyance of the will, I\n      retraced my steps and as earnestly struggled to awaken him. In\n      this attempt I soon saw that I should be successful\u2014or at least I\n      soon fancied that my success would be complete\u2014and I am sure that\n      all in the room were prepared to see the patient awaken.\n\n      For what really occurred, however, it is quite impossible that\n      any human being could have been prepared.\n\n      As I rapidly made the mesmeric passes, amid ejaculations of\n      \u201cdead! dead!\u201d absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from\n      the lips of the sufferer, his whole frame at once\u2014within the\n      space of a single minute, or even less,\n      shrunk\u2014crumbled\u2014absolutely rotted away beneath my hands. Upon the\n      bed, before that whole company, there lay a nearly liquid mass of\n      loathsome\u2014of detestable putrescence.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BLACK CAT.\n\n\n      For the most wild, yet most homely narrative which I am about to\n      pen, I neither expect nor solicit belief. Mad indeed would I be\n      to expect it, in a case where my very senses reject their own\n      evidence. Yet, mad am I not\u2014and very surely do I not dream. But\n      to-morrow I die, and to-day I would unburthen my soul. My\n      immediate purpose is to place before the world, plainly,\n      succinctly, and without comment, a series of mere household\n      events. In their consequences, these events have terrified\u2014have\n      tortured\u2014have destroyed me. Yet I will not attempt to expound\n      them. To me, they have presented little but horror\u2014to many they\n      will seem less terrible than _barroques_. Hereafter, perhaps,\n      some intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the\n      common-place\u2014some intellect more calm, more logical, and far less\n      excitable than my own, which will perceive, in the circumstances\n      I detail with awe, nothing more than an ordinary succession of\n      very natural causes and effects.\n\n      From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my\n      disposition. My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to\n      make me the jest of my companions. I was especially fond of\n      animals, and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of\n      pets. With these I spent most of my time, and never was so happy\n      as when feeding and caressing them. This peculiarity of character\n      grew with my growth, and in my manhood, I derived from it one of\n      my principal sources of pleasure. To those who have cherished an\n      affection for a faithful and sagacious dog, I need hardly be at\n      the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of the\n      gratification thus derivable. There is something in the unselfish\n      and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the\n      heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry\n      friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere _Man_.\n\n      I married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition\n      not uncongenial with my own. Observing my partiality for domestic\n      pets, she lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most\n      agreeable kind. We had birds, gold-fish, a fine dog, rabbits, a\n      small monkey, and _a cat_.\n\n      This latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, entirely\n      black, and sagacious to an astonishing degree. In speaking of his\n      intelligence, my wife, who at heart was not a little tinctured\n      with superstition, made frequent allusion to the ancient popular\n      notion, which regarded all black cats as witches in disguise. Not\n      that she was ever _serious_ upon this point\u2014and I mention the\n      matter at all for no better reason than that it happens, just\n      now, to be remembered.\n\n      Pluto\u2014this was the cat\u2019s name\u2014was my favorite pet and playmate. I\n      alone fed him, and he attended me wherever I went about the\n      house. It was even with difficulty that I could prevent him from\n      following me through the streets.\n\n      Our friendship lasted, in this manner, for several years, during\n      which my general temperament and character\u2014through the\n      instrumentality of the Fiend Intemperance\u2014had (I blush to confess\n      it) experienced a radical alteration for the worse. I grew, day\n      by day, more moody, more irritable, more regardless of the\n      feelings of others. I suffered myself to use intemperate language\n      to my wife. At length, I even offered her personal violence. My\n      pets, of course, were made to feel the change in my disposition.\n      I not only neglected, but ill-used them. For Pluto, however, I\n      still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from maltreating\n      him, as I made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits, the monkey,\n      or even the dog, when by accident, or through affection, they\n      came in my way. But my disease grew upon me\u2014for what disease is\n      like Alcohol!\u2014and at length even Pluto, who was now becoming old,\n      and consequently somewhat peevish\u2014even Pluto began to experience\n      the effects of my ill temper.\n\n      One night, returning home, much intoxicated, from one of my\n      haunts about town, I fancied that the cat avoided my presence. I\n      seized him; when, in his fright at my violence, he inflicted a\n      slight wound upon my hand with his teeth. The fury of a demon\n      instantly possessed me. I knew myself no longer. My original soul\n      seemed, at once, to take its flight from my body and a more than\n      fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured, thrilled every fibre of my\n      frame. I took from my waistcoat-pocket a pen-knife, opened it,\n      grasped the poor beast by the throat, and deliberately cut one of\n      its eyes from the socket! I blush, I burn, I shudder, while I pen\n      the damnable atrocity.\n\n      When reason returned with the morning\u2014when I had slept off the\n      fumes of the night\u2019s debauch\u2014I experienced a sentiment half of\n      horror, half of remorse, for the crime of which I had been\n      guilty; but it was, at best, a feeble and equivocal feeling, and\n      the soul remained untouched. I again plunged into excess, and\n      soon drowned in wine all memory of the deed.\n\n      In the meantime the cat slowly recovered. The socket of the lost\n      eye presented, it is true, a frightful appearance, but he no\n      longer appeared to suffer any pain. He went about the house as\n      usual, but, as might be expected, fled in extreme terror at my\n      approach. I had so much of my old heart left, as to be at first\n      grieved by this evident dislike on the part of a creature which\n      had once so loved me. But this feeling soon gave place to\n      irritation. And then came, as if to my final and irrevocable\n      overthrow, the spirit of PERVERSENESS. Of this spirit philosophy\n      takes no account. Yet I am not more sure that my soul lives, than\n      I am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the\n      human heart\u2014one of the indivisible primary faculties, or\n      sentiments, which give direction to the character of Man. Who has\n      not, a hundred times, found himself committing a vile or a silly\n      action, for no other reason than because he knows he should not?\n      Have we not a perpetual inclination, in the teeth of our best\n      judgment, to violate that which is _Law_, merely because we\n      understand it to be such? This spirit of perverseness, I say,\n      came to my final overthrow. It was this unfathomable longing of\n      the soul _to vex itself_\u2014to offer violence to its own nature\u2014to\n      do wrong for the wrong\u2019s sake only\u2014that urged me to continue and\n      finally to consummate the injury I had inflicted upon the\n      unoffending brute. One morning, in cool blood, I slipped a noose\n      about its neck and hung it to the limb of a tree;\u2014hung it with\n      the tears streaming from my eyes, and with the bitterest remorse\n      at my heart;\u2014hung it _because_ I knew that it had loved me, and\n      _because_ I felt it had given me no reason of offence;\u2014hung it\n      _because_ I knew that in so doing I was committing a sin\u2014a deadly\n      sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul as to place it\u2014if\n      such a thing wore possible\u2014even beyond the reach of the infinite\n      mercy of the Most Merciful and Most Terrible God.\n\n      On the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done, I was\n      aroused from sleep by the cry of fire. The curtains of my bed\n      were in flames. The whole house was blazing. It was with great\n      difficulty that my wife, a servant, and myself, made our escape\n      from the conflagration. The destruction was complete. My entire\n      worldly wealth was swallowed up, and I resigned myself\n      thenceforward to despair.\n\n      I am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of\n      cause and effect, between the disaster and the atrocity. But I am\n      detailing a chain of facts\u2014and wish not to leave even a possible\n      link imperfect. On the day succeeding the fire, I visited the\n      ruins. The walls, with one exception, had fallen in. This\n      exception was found in a compartment wall, not very thick, which\n      stood about the middle of the house, and against which had rested\n      the head of my bed. The plastering had here, in great measure,\n      resisted the action of the fire\u2014a fact which I attributed to its\n      having been recently spread. About this wall a dense crowd were\n      collected, and many persons seemed to be examining a particular\n      portion of it with very minute and eager attention. The words\n      \u201cstrange!\u201d \u201csingular!\u201d and other similar expressions, excited my\n      curiosity. I approached and saw, as if graven in _bas relief_\n      upon the white surface, the figure of a gigantic _cat_. The\n      impression was given with an accuracy truly marvellous. There was\n      a rope about the animal\u2019s neck.\n\n      When I first beheld this apparition\u2014for I could scarcely regard\n      it as less\u2014my wonder and my terror were extreme. But at length\n      reflection came to my aid. The cat, I remembered, had been hung\n      in a garden adjacent to the house. Upon the alarm of fire, this\n      garden had been immediately filled by the crowd\u2014by some one of\n      whom the animal must have been cut from the tree and thrown,\n      through an open window, into my chamber. This had probably been\n      done with the view of arousing me from sleep. The falling of\n      other walls had compressed the victim of my cruelty into the\n      substance of the freshly-spread plaster; the lime of which, with\n      the flames, and the _ammonia_ from the carcass, had then\n      accomplished the portraiture as I saw it.\n\n      Although I thus readily accounted to my reason, if not altogether\n      to my conscience, for the startling fact just detailed, it did\n      not the less fail to make a deep impression upon my fancy. For\n      months I could not rid myself of the phantasm of the cat; and,\n      during this period, there came back into my spirit a\n      half-sentiment that seemed, but was not, remorse. I went so far\n      as to regret the loss of the animal, and to look about me, among\n      the vile haunts which I now habitually frequented, for another\n      pet of the same species, and of somewhat similar appearance, with\n      which to supply its place.\n\n      One night as I sat, half stupefied, in a den of more than infamy,\n      my attention was suddenly drawn to some black object, reposing\n      upon the head of one of the immense hogsheads of gin, or of rum,\n      which constituted the chief furniture of the apartment. I had\n      been looking steadily at the top of this hogshead for some\n      minutes, and what now caused me surprise was the fact that I had\n      not sooner perceived the object thereupon. I approached it, and\n      touched it with my hand. It was a black cat\u2014a very large\n      one\u2014fully as large as Pluto, and closely resembling him in every\n      respect but one. Pluto had not a white hair upon any portion of\n      his body; but this cat had a large, although indefinite splotch\n      of white, covering nearly the whole region of the breast. Upon my\n      touching him, he immediately arose, purred loudly, rubbed against\n      my hand, and appeared delighted with my notice. This, then, was\n      the very creature of which I was in search. I at once offered to\n      purchase it of the landlord; but this person made no claim to\n      it\u2014knew nothing of it\u2014had never seen it before.\n\n      I continued my caresses, and, when I prepared to go home, the\n      animal evinced a disposition to accompany me. I permitted it to\n      do so; occasionally stooping and patting it as I proceeded. When\n      it reached the house it domesticated itself at once, and became\n      immediately a great favorite with my wife.\n\n      For my own part, I soon found a dislike to it arising within me.\n      This was just the reverse of what I had anticipated; but\u2014I know\n      not how or why it was\u2014its evident fondness for myself rather\n      disgusted and annoyed. By slow degrees, these feelings of disgust\n      and annoyance rose into the bitterness of hatred. I avoided the\n      creature; a certain sense of shame, and the remembrance of my\n      former deed of cruelty, preventing me from physically abusing it.\n      I did not, for some weeks, strike, or otherwise violently ill use\n      it; but gradually\u2014very gradually\u2014I came to look upon it with\n      unutterable loathing, and to flee silently from its odious\n      presence, as from the breath of a pestilence.\n\n      What added, no doubt, to my hatred of the beast, was the\n      discovery, on the morning after I brought it home, that, like\n      Pluto, it also had been deprived of one of its eyes. This\n      circumstance, however, only endeared it to my wife, who, as I\n      have already said, possessed, in a high degree, that humanity of\n      feeling which had once been my distinguishing trait, and the\n      source of many of my simplest and purest pleasures.\n\n      With my aversion to this cat, however, its partiality for myself\n      seemed to increase. It followed my footsteps with a pertinacity\n      which it would be difficult to make the reader comprehend.\n      Whenever I sat, it would crouch beneath my chair, or spring upon\n      my knees, covering me with its loathsome caresses. If I arose to\n      walk it would get between my feet and thus nearly throw me down,\n      or, fastening its long and sharp claws in my dress, clamber, in\n      this manner, to my breast. At such times, although I longed to\n      destroy it with a blow, I was yet withheld from so doing, partly\n      by a memory of my former crime, but chiefly\u2014let me confess it at\n      once\u2014by absolute dread of the beast.\n\n      This dread was not exactly a dread of physical evil\u2014and yet I\n      should be at a loss how otherwise to define it. I am almost\n      ashamed to own\u2014yes, even in this felon\u2019s cell, I am almost\n      ashamed to own\u2014that the terror and horror with which the animal\n      inspired me, had been heightened by one of the merest chimaeras\n      it would be possible to conceive. My wife had called my\n      attention, more than once, to the character of the mark of white\n      hair, of which I have spoken, and which constituted the sole\n      visible difference between the strange beast and the one I had\n      destroyed. The reader will remember that this mark, although\n      large, had been originally very indefinite; but, by slow\n      degrees\u2014degrees nearly imperceptible, and which for a long time\n      my reason struggled to reject as fanciful\u2014it had, at length,\n      assumed a rigorous distinctness of outline. It was now the\n      representation of an object that I shudder to name\u2014and for this,\n      above all, I loathed, and dreaded, and would have rid myself of\n      the monster _had I dared_\u2014it was now, I say, the image of a\n      hideous\u2014of a ghastly thing\u2014of the GALLOWS!\u2014oh, mournful and\n      terrible engine of Horror and of Crime\u2014of Agony and of Death!\n\n      And now was I indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere\n      Humanity. And _a brute beast _\u2014whose fellow I had contemptuously\n      destroyed\u2014_a brute beast_ to work out for _me_\u2014for me a man,\n      fashioned in the image of the High God\u2014so much of insufferable\n      woe! Alas! neither by day nor by night knew I the blessing of\n      rest any more! During the former the creature left me no moment\n      alone, and in the latter I started hourly from dreams of\n      unutterable fear to find the hot breath of _the thing_ upon my\n      face, and its vast weight\u2014an incarnate nightmare that I had no\n      power to shake off\u2014incumbent eternally upon my _heart!_\n\n      Beneath the pressure of torments such as these, the feeble\n      remnant of the good within me succumbed. Evil thoughts became my\n      sole intimates\u2014the darkest and most evil of thoughts. The\n      moodiness of my usual temper increased to hatred of all things\n      and of all mankind; while, from the sudden, frequent, and\n      ungovernable outbursts of a fury to which I now blindly abandoned\n      myself, my uncomplaining wife, alas, was the most usual and the\n      most patient of sufferers.\n\n      One day she accompanied me, upon some household errand, into the\n      cellar of the old building which our poverty compelled us to\n      inhabit. The cat followed me down the steep stairs, and, nearly\n      throwing me headlong, exasperated me to madness. Uplifting an\n      axe, and forgetting, in my wrath, the childish dread which had\n      hitherto stayed my hand, I aimed a blow at the animal which, of\n      course, would have proved instantly fatal had it descended as I\n      wished. But this blow was arrested by the hand of my wife.\n      Goaded, by the interference, into a rage more than demoniacal, I\n      withdrew my arm from her grasp and buried the axe in her brain.\n      She fell dead upon the spot, without a groan.\n\n      This hideous murder accomplished, I set myself forthwith, and\n      with entire deliberation, to the task of concealing the body. I\n      knew that I could not remove it from the house, either by day or\n      by night, without the risk of being observed by the neighbors.\n      Many projects entered my mind. At one period I thought of cutting\n      the corpse into minute fragments, and destroying them by fire. At\n      another, I resolved to dig a grave for it in the floor of the\n      cellar. Again, I deliberated about casting it in the well in the\n      yard\u2014about packing it in a box, as if merchandise, with the usual\n      arrangements, and so getting a porter to take it from the house.\n      Finally I hit upon what I considered a far better expedient than\n      either of these. I determined to wall it up in the cellar\u2014as the\n      monks of the middle ages are recorded to have walled up their\n      victims.\n\n      For a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted. Its walls\n      were loosely constructed, and had lately been plastered\n      throughout with a rough plaster, which the dampness of the\n      atmosphere had prevented from hardening. Moreover, in one of the\n      walls was a projection, caused by a false chimney, or fireplace,\n      that had been filled up, and made to resemble the red of the\n      cellar. I made no doubt that I could readily displace the bricks\n      at this point, insert the corpse, and wall the whole up as\n      before, so that no eye could detect any thing suspicious. And in\n      this calculation I was not deceived. By means of a crow-bar I\n      easily dislodged the bricks, and, having carefully deposited the\n      body against the inner wall, I propped it in that position,\n      while, with little trouble, I re-laid the whole structure as it\n      originally stood. Having procured mortar, sand, and hair, with\n      every possible precaution, I prepared a plaster which could not\n      be distinguished from the old, and with this I very carefully\n      went over the new brickwork. When I had finished, I felt\n      satisfied that all was right. The wall did not present the\n      slightest appearance of having been disturbed. The rubbish on the\n      floor was picked up with the minutest care. I looked around\n      triumphantly, and said to myself: \u201cHere at least, then, my labor\n      has not been in vain.\u201d\n\n      My next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause\n      of so much wretchedness; for I had, at length, firmly resolved to\n      put it to death. Had I been able to meet with it, at the moment,\n      there could have been no doubt of its fate; but it appeared that\n      the crafty animal had been alarmed at the violence of my previous\n      anger, and forebore to present itself in my present mood. It is\n      impossible to describe, or to imagine, the deep, the blissful\n      sense of relief which the absence of the detested creature\n      occasioned in my bosom. It did not make its appearance during the\n      night; and thus for one night at least, since its introduction\n      into the house, I soundly and tranquilly slept; aye, slept even\n      with the burden of murder upon my soul!\n\n      The second and the third day passed, and still my tormentor came\n      not. Once again I breathed as a freeman. The monster, in terror,\n      had fled the premises forever! I should behold it no more! My\n      happiness was supreme! The guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but\n      little. Some few inquiries had been made, but these had been\n      readily answered. Even a search had been instituted\u2014but of course\n      nothing was to be discovered. I looked upon my future felicity as\n      secured.\n\n      Upon the fourth day of the assassination, a party of the police\n      came, very unexpectedly, into the house, and proceeded again to\n      make rigorous investigation of the premises. Secure, however, in\n      the inscrutability of my place of concealment, I felt no\n      embarrassment whatever. The officers bade me accompany them in\n      their search. They left no nook or corner unexplored. At length,\n      for the third or fourth time, they descended into the cellar. I\n      quivered not in a muscle. My heart beat calmly as that of one who\n      slumbers in innocence. I walked the cellar from end to end. I\n      folded my arms upon my bosom, and roamed easily to and fro. The\n      police were thoroughly satisfied and prepared to depart. The glee\n      at my heart was too strong to be restrained. I burned to say if\n      but one word, by way of triumph, and to render doubly sure their\n      assurance of my guiltlessness.\n\n      \u201cGentlemen,\u201d I said at last, as the party ascended the steps, \u201cI\n      delight to have allayed your suspicions. I wish you all health,\n      and a little more courtesy. By the bye, gentlemen, this\u2014this is a\n      very well-constructed house.\u201d (In the rabid desire to say\n      something easily, I scarcely knew what I uttered at all.)\u2014\u201cI may\n      say an _excellently_ well-constructed house. These walls\u2014are you\n      going, gentlemen?\u2014these walls are solidly put together;\u201d and\n      here, through the mere phrenzy of bravado, I rapped heavily, with\n      a cane which I held in my hand, upon that very portion of the\n      brick-work behind which stood the corpse of the wife of my bosom.\n\n      But may God shield and deliver me from the fangs of the\n      Arch-Fiend! No sooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk into\n      silence, than I was answered by a voice from within the tomb!\u2014by\n      a cry, at first muffled and broken, like the sobbing of a child,\n      and then quickly swelling into one long, loud, and continuous\n      scream, utterly anomalous and inhuman\u2014a howl\u2014a wailing shriek,\n      half of horror and half of triumph, such as might have arisen\n      only out of hell, conjointly from the throats of the damned in\n      their agony and of the demons that exult in the damnation.\n\n      Of my own thoughts it is folly to speak. Swooning, I staggered to\n      the opposite wall. For one instant the party upon the stairs\n      remained motionless, through extremity of terror and of awe. In\n      the next, a dozen stout arms were toiling at the wall. It fell\n      bodily. The corpse, already greatly decayed and clotted with\n      gore, stood erect before the eyes of the spectators. Upon its\n      head, with red extended mouth and solitary eye of fire, sat the\n      hideous beast whose craft had seduced me into murder, and whose\n      informing voice had consigned me to the hangman. I had walled the\n      monster up within the tomb!\n\n\n\n\nTHE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER\n\n\n     Son c\u0153ur est un luth suspendu;\n     Sit\u00f4t qu\u2019on le touche il r\u00e9sonne..\n\n\u2014_De B\u00e9ranger_.\n\n      During the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn\n      of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the\n      heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a\n      singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself,\n      as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the\n      melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it was\u2014but, with the\n      first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom\n      pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was\n      unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic,\n      sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest\n      natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the\n      scene before me\u2014upon the mere house, and the simple landscape\n      features of the domain\u2014upon the bleak walls\u2014upon the vacant\n      eye-like windows\u2014upon a few rank sedges\u2014and upon a few white\n      trunks of decayed trees\u2014with an utter depression of soul which I\n      can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the\n      after-dream of the reveller upon opium\u2014the bitter lapse into\n      everyday life\u2014the hideous dropping off of the veil. There was an\n      iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart\u2014an unredeemed\n      dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could\n      torture into aught of the sublime. What was it\u2014I paused to\n      think\u2014what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the\n      House of Usher? It was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I\n      grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I\n      pondered. I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory\n      conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there _are_ combinations of\n      very simple natural objects which have the power of thus\n      affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among\n      considerations beyond our depth. It was possible, I reflected,\n      that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the\n      scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to\n      modify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful\n      impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horse to the\n      precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled\n      lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down\u2014but with a shudder even\n      more thrilling than before\u2014upon the remodelled and inverted\n      images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the\n      vacant and eye-like windows.\n\n      Nevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a\n      sojourn of some weeks. Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been\n      one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed\n      since our last meeting. A letter, however, had lately reached me\n      in a distant part of the country\u2014a letter from him\u2014which, in its\n      wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no other than a\n      personal reply. The MS. gave evidence of nervous agitation. The\n      writer spoke of acute bodily illness\u2014of a mental disorder which\n      oppressed him\u2014and of an earnest desire to see me, as his best,\n      and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of attempting,\n      by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his\n      malady. It was the manner in which all this, and much more, was\n      said\u2014it was the apparent _heart_ that went with his request\u2014which\n      allowed me no room for hesitation; and I accordingly obeyed\n      forthwith what I still considered a very singular summons.\n\n      Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I\n      really knew little of my friend. His reserve had been always\n      excessive and habitual. I was aware, however, that his very\n      ancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar\n      sensibility of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages,\n      in many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late, in\n      repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as\n      in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more\n      than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties, of musical\n      science. I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the\n      stem of the Usher race, all time-honored as it was, had put\n      forth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that\n      the entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had\n      always, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain.\n      It was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in\n      thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with\n      the accredited character of the people, and while speculating\n      upon the possible influence which the one, in the long lapse of\n      centuries, might have exercised upon the other\u2014it was this\n      deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent\n      undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with\n      the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge\n      the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal\n      appellation of the \u201cHouse of Usher\u201d\u2014an appellation which seemed\n      to include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the\n      family and the family mansion.\n\n      I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish\n      experiment\u2014that of looking down within the tarn\u2014had been to\n      deepen the first singular impression. There can be no doubt that\n      the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition\u2014for\n      why should I not so term it?\u2014served mainly to accelerate the\n      increase itself. Such, I have long known, is the paradoxical law\n      of all sentiments having terror as a basis. And it might have\n      been for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to\n      the house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my\n      mind a strange fancy\u2014a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but\n      mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which\n      oppressed me. I had so worked upon my imagination as really to\n      believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an\n      atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity\u2014an\n      atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but\n      which had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the gray wall,\n      and the silent tarn\u2014a pestilent and mystic vapor, dull, sluggish,\n      faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.\n\n      Shaking off from my spirit what _must_ have been a dream, I\n      scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building. Its\n      principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity.\n      The discoloration of ages had been great. Minute fungi overspread\n      the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the\n      eaves. Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary\n      dilapidation. No portion of the masonry had fallen; and there\n      appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect\n      adaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the\n      individual stones. In this there was much that reminded me of the\n      specious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long\n      years in some neglected vault, with no disturbance from the\n      breath of the external air. Beyond this indication of extensive\n      decay, however, the fabric gave little token of instability.\n      Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered\n      a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from the roof of\n      the building in front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag\n      direction, until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn.\n\n      Noticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house.\n      A servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic\n      archway of the hall. A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted\n      me, in silence, through many dark and intricate passages in my\n      progress to the _studio_ of his master. Much that I encountered\n      on the way contributed, I know not how, to heighten the vague\n      sentiments of which I have already spoken. While the objects\n      around me\u2014while the carvings of the ceilings, the sombre\n      tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackness of the floors, and\n      the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as I strode,\n      were but matters to which, or to such as which, I had been\n      accustomed from my infancy\u2014while I hesitated not to acknowledge\n      how familiar was all this\u2014I still wondered to find how unfamiliar\n      were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up. On one\n      of the staircases, I met the physician of the family. His\n      countenance, I thought, wore a mingled expression of low cunning\n      and perplexity. He accosted me with trepidation and passed on.\n      The valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence\n      of his master.\n\n      The room in which I found myself was very large and lofty. The\n      windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance\n      from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from\n      within. Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through\n      the trellissed panes, and served to render sufficiently distinct\n      the more prominent objects around; the eye, however, struggled in\n      vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber, or the recesses\n      of the vaulted and fretted ceiling. Dark draperies hung upon the\n      walls. The general furniture was profuse, comfortless, antique,\n      and tattered. Many books and musical instruments lay scattered\n      about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene. I felt that\n      I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow. An air of stern, deep, and\n      irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all.\n\n      Upon my entrance, Usher arose from a sofa on which he had been\n      lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth\n      which had much in it, I at first thought, of an overdone\n      cordiality\u2014of the constrained effort of the _ennuy\u00e9_ man of the\n      world. A glance, however, at his countenance, convinced me of his\n      perfect sincerity. We sat down; and for some moments, while he\n      spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity, half of\n      awe. Surely, man had never before so terribly altered, in so\n      brief a period, as had Roderick Usher! It was with difficulty\n      that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being\n      before me with the companion of my early boyhood. Yet the\n      character of his face had been at all times remarkable. A\n      cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous\n      beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a\n      surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model,\n      but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a\n      finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a\n      want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and\n      tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the\n      regions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not\n      easily to be forgotten. And now in the mere exaggeration of the\n      prevailing character of these features, and of the expression\n      they were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted to\n      whom I spoke. The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now\n      miraculous lustre of the eye, above all things startled and even\n      awed me. The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all\n      unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather\n      than fell about the face, I could not, even with effort, connect\n      its Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.\n\n      In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an\n      incoherence\u2014an inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from\n      a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual\n      trepidancy\u2014an excessive nervous agitation. For something of this\n      nature I had indeed been prepared, no less by his letter, than by\n      reminiscences of certain boyish traits, and by conclusions\n      deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament.\n      His action was alternately vivacious and sullen. His voice varied\n      rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the animal spirits\n      seemed utterly in abeyance) to that species of energetic\n      concision\u2014that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding\n      enunciation\u2014that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated\n      guttural utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard,\n      or the irreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of his\n      most intense excitement.\n\n      It was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his\n      earnest desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to\n      afford him. He entered, at some length, into what he conceived to\n      be the nature of his malady. It was, he said, a constitutional\n      and a family evil, and one for which he despaired to find a\n      remedy\u2014a mere nervous affection, he immediately added, which\n      would undoubtedly soon pass off. It displayed itself in a host of\n      unnatural sensations. Some of these, as he detailed them,\n      interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms, and\n      the general manner of the narration had their weight. He suffered\n      much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food\n      was alone endurable; he could wear only garments of certain\n      texture; the odors of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were\n      tortured by even a faint light; and there were but peculiar\n      sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which did not\n      inspire him with horror.\n\n      To an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden slave. \u201cI\n      shall perish,\u201d said he, \u201cI must perish in this deplorable folly.\n      Thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall I be lost. I dread the\n      events of the future, not in themselves, but in their results. I\n      shudder at the thought of any, even the most trivial, incident,\n      which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul. I\n      have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger, except in its absolute\n      effect\u2014in terror. In this unnerved\u2014in this pitiable condition\u2014I\n      feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when I must\n      abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the grim\n      phantasm, FEAR.\u201d\n\n      I learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and\n      equivocal hints, another singular feature of his mental\n      condition. He was enchained by certain superstitious impressions\n      in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many\n      years, he had never ventured forth\u2014in regard to an influence\n      whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here\n      to be re-stated\u2014an influence which some peculiarities in the mere\n      form and substance of his family mansion, had, by dint of long\n      sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit\u2014an effect which the\n      _physique_ of the gray walls and turrets, and of the dim tarn\n      into which they all looked down, had, at length, brought about\n      upon the _morale_ of his existence.\n\n      He admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the\n      peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more\n      natural and far more palpable origin\u2014to the severe and\n      long-continued illness\u2014indeed to the evidently approaching\n      dissolution\u2014of a tenderly beloved sister\u2014his sole companion for\n      long years\u2014his last and only relative on earth. \u201cHer decease,\u201d he\n      said, with a bitterness which I can never forget, \u201cwould leave\n      him (him the hopeless and the frail) the last of the ancient race\n      of the Ushers.\u201d While he spoke, the lady Madeline (for so was she\n      called) passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment,\n      and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared. I regarded\n      her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread\u2014and yet I\n      found it impossible to account for such feelings. A sensation of\n      stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps.\n      When a door, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought\n      instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother\u2014but he\n      had buried his face in his hands, and I could only perceive that\n      a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated\n      fingers through which trickled many passionate tears.\n\n      The disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of\n      her physicians. A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the\n      person, and frequent although transient affections of a partially\n      cataleptical character, were the unusual diagnosis. Hitherto she\n      had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady, and had\n      not betaken herself finally to bed; but, on the closing in of the\n      evening of my arrival at the house, she succumbed (as her brother\n      told me at night with inexpressible agitation) to the prostrating\n      power of the destroyer; and I learned that the glimpse I had\n      obtained of her person would thus probably be the last I should\n      obtain\u2014that the lady, at least while living, would be seen by me\n      no more.\n\n      For several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either\n      Usher or myself; and during this period I was busied in earnest\n      endeavors to alleviate the melancholy of my friend. We painted\n      and read together; or I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild\n      improvisations of his speaking guitar. And thus, as a closer and\n      still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the\n      recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did I perceive the\n      futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness,\n      as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all objects\n      of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiation of\n      gloom.\n\n      I shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I\n      thus spent alone with the master of the House of Usher. Yet I\n      should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact\n      character of the studies, or of the occupations, in which he\n      involved me, or led me the way. An excited and highly distempered\n      ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over all. His long improvised\n      dirges will ring forever in my ears. Among other things, I hold\n      painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification\n      of the wild air of the last waltz of Von Weber. From the\n      paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew,\n      touch by touch, into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more\n      thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not why\u2014from these\n      paintings (vivid as their images now are before me) I would in\n      vain endeavor to educe more than a small portion which should lie\n      within the compass of merely written words. By the utter\n      simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs, he arrested and\n      overawed attention. If ever mortal painted an idea, that mortal\n      was Roderick Usher. For me at least\u2014in the circumstances then\n      surrounding me\u2014there arose out of the pure abstractions which the\n      hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvass, an intensity\n      of intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I ever yet in the\n      contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries\n      of Fuseli.\n\n      One of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking not\n      so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth,\n      although feebly, in words. A small picture presented the interior\n      of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low\n      walls, smooth, white, and without interruption or device. Certain\n      accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea\n      that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface\n      of the earth. No outlet was observed in any portion of its vast\n      extent, and no torch, or other artificial source of light was\n      discernible; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout, and\n      bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor.\n\n      I have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve\n      which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the\n      exception of certain effects of stringed instruments. It was,\n      perhaps, the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon\n      the guitar, which gave birth, in great measure, to the fantastic\n      character of his performances. But the fervid _facility_ of his\n      _impromptus_ could not be so accounted for. They must have been,\n      and were, in the notes, as well as in the words of his wild\n      fantasias (for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with\n      rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that intense mental\n      collectedness and concentration to which I have previously\n      alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest\n      artificial excitement. The words of one of these rhapsodies I\n      have easily remembered. I was, perhaps, the more forcibly\n      impressed with it, as he gave it, because, in the under or mystic\n      current of its meaning, I fancied that I perceived, and for the\n      first time, a full consciousness on the part of Usher of the\n      tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne. The verses, which\n      were entitled \u201cThe Haunted Palace,\u201d ran very nearly, if not\n      accurately, thus:\n\n                        I.\n     In the greenest of our valleys,\n    By good angels tenanted,\n     Once a fair and stately palace\u2014\n    Radiant palace\u2014reared its head.\n     In the monarch Thought\u2019s dominion\u2014\n    It stood there!\n     Never seraph spread a pinion\n    Over fabric half so fair.\n\n                        II.\n     Banners yellow, glorious, golden,\n    On its roof did float and flow;\n     (This\u2014all this\u2014was in the olden\n    Time long ago)\n     And every gentle air that dallied,\n    In that sweet day,\n     Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,\n    A winged odor went away.\n\n                        III.\n     Wanderers in that happy valley\n    Through two luminous windows saw\n     Spirits moving musically\n    To a lute\u2019s well-tun\u00e9d law,\n     Round about a throne, where sitting\n    (Porphyrogene!)\n     In state his glory well befitting,\n    The ruler of the realm was seen.\n\n                        IV.\n     And all with pearl and ruby glowing\n    Was the fair palace door,\n     Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,\n    And sparkling evermore,\n     A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty\n    Was but to sing,\n     In voices of surpassing beauty,\n    The wit and wisdom of their king.\n\n                        V.\n     But evil things, in robes of sorrow,\n    Assailed the monarch\u2019s high estate;\n     (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow\n    Shall dawn upon him, desolate!)\n     And, round about his home, the glory\n    That blushed and bloomed\n     Is but a dim-remembered story\n    Of the old time entombed.\n\n                        VI.\n     And travellers now within that valley,\n    Through the red-litten windows, see\n     Vast forms that move fantastically\n    To a discordant melody;\n     While, like a rapid ghastly river,\n    Through the pale door,\n     A hideous throng rush out forever,\n    And laugh\u2014but smile no more.\n\n      I well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad, led us\n      into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion\n      of Usher\u2019s which I mention not so much on account of its novelty,\n      (for other men * have thought thus,) as on account of the\n      pertinacity with which he maintained it. This opinion, in its\n      general form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things.\n      But, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring\n      character, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the\n      kingdom of inorganization. I lack words to express the full\n      extent, or the earnest _abandon_ of his persuasion. The belief,\n      however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the\n      gray stones of the home of his forefathers. The conditions of the\n      sentience had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of\n      collocation of these stones\u2014in the order of their arrangement, as\n      well as in that of the many _fungi_ which overspread them, and of\n      the decayed trees which stood around\u2014above all, in the long\n      undisturbed endurance of this arrangement, and in its\n      reduplication in the still waters of the tarn. Its evidence\u2014the\n      evidence of the sentience\u2014was to be seen, he said, (and I here\n      started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain condensation of\n      an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls. The\n      result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet\n      importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had\n      moulded the destinies of his family, and which made _him_ what I\n      now saw him\u2014what he was. Such opinions need no comment, and I\n      will make none.\n\n      * Watson, Dr. Percival, Spallanzani, and especially the Bishop of\n      Landaff.\u2014See \u201cChemical Essays,\u201d vol v.\n\n      Our books\u2014the books which, for years, had formed no small portion\n      of the mental existence of the invalid\u2014were, as might be\n      supposed, in strict keeping with this character of phantasm. We\n      pored together over such works as the Ververt et Chartreuse of\n      Gresset; the Belphegor of Machiavelli; the Heaven and Hell of\n      Swedenborg; the Subterranean Voyage of Nicholas Klimm by Holberg;\n      the Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of Jean D\u2019Indagin\u00e9, and of De la\n      Chambre; the Journey into the Blue Distance of Tieck; and the\n      City of the Sun of Campanella. One favorite volume was a small\n      octavo edition of the _Directorium Inquisitorium_, by the\n      Dominican Eymeric de Gironne; and there were passages in\n      Pomponius Mela, about the old African Satyrs and OEgipans, over\n      which Usher would sit dreaming for hours. His chief delight,\n      however, was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and\n      curious book in quarto Gothic\u2014the manual of a forgotten\n      church\u2014the _Vigiliae Mortuorum secundum Chorum Ecclesiae\n      Maguntinae_.\n\n      I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of\n      its probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening,\n      having informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more,\n      he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight,\n      (previously to its final interment,) in one of the numerous\n      vaults within the main walls of the building. The worldly reason,\n      however, assigned for this singular proceeding, was one which I\n      did not feel at liberty to dispute. The brother had been led to\n      his resolution (so he told me) by consideration of the unusual\n      character of the malady of the deceased, of certain obtrusive and\n      eager inquiries on the part of her medical men, and of the remote\n      and exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family. I will\n      not deny that when I called to mind the sinister countenance of\n      the person whom I met upon the staircase, on the day of my\n      arrival at the house, I had no desire to oppose what I regarded\n      as at best but a harmless, and by no means an unnatural,\n      precaution.\n\n      At the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the\n      arrangements for the temporary entombment. The body having been\n      encoffined, we two alone bore it to its rest. The vault in which\n      we placed it (and which had been so long unopened that our\n      torches, half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere, gave us\n      little opportunity for investigation) was small, damp, and\n      entirely without means of admission for light; lying, at great\n      depth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in which\n      was my own sleeping apartment. It had been used, apparently, in\n      remote feudal times, for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep,\n      and, in later days, as a place of deposit for powder, or some\n      other highly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor,\n      and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached\n      it, were carefully sheathed with copper. The door, of massive\n      iron, had been, also, similarly protected. Its immense weight\n      caused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its\n      hinges.\n\n      Having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this\n      region of horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid\n      of the coffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant. A striking\n      similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my\n      attention; and Usher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured\n      out some few words from which I learned that the deceased and\n      himself had been twins, and that sympathies of a scarcely\n      intelligible nature had always existed between them. Our glances,\n      however, rested not long upon the dead\u2014for we could not regard\n      her unawed. The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the\n      maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a\n      strictly cataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush\n      upon the bosom and the face, and that suspiciously lingering\n      smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death. We replaced and\n      screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door of iron, made\n      our way, with toil, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of\n      the upper portion of the house.\n\n      And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable\n      change came over the features of the mental disorder of my\n      friend. His ordinary manner had vanished. His ordinary\n      occupations were neglected or forgotten. He roamed from chamber\n      to chamber with hurried, unequal, and objectless step. The pallor\n      of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more ghastly\n      hue\u2014but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out. The\n      once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a\n      tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually\n      characterized his utterance. There were times, indeed, when I\n      thought his unceasingly agitated mind was laboring with some\n      oppressive secret, to divulge which he struggled for the\n      necessary courage. At times, again, I was obliged to resolve all\n      into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, for I beheld him\n      gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of the\n      profoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginary sound.\n      It was no wonder that his condition terrified\u2014that it infected\n      me. I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the\n      wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive\n      superstitions.\n\n      It was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the\n      seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline\n      within the donjon, that I experienced the full power of such\n      feelings. Sleep came not near my couch\u2014while the hours waned and\n      waned away. I struggled to reason off the nervousness which had\n      dominion over me. I endeavored to believe that much, if not all\n      of what I felt, was due to the bewildering influence of the\n      gloomy furniture of the room\u2014of the dark and tattered draperies,\n      which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest,\n      swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily\n      about the decorations of the bed. But my efforts were fruitless.\n      An irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame; and, at\n      length, there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly\n      causeless alarm. Shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle, I\n      uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly within\n      the intense darkness of the chamber, harkened\u2014I know not why,\n      except that an instinctive spirit prompted me\u2014to certain low and\n      indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses of the storm, at\n      long intervals, I knew not whence. Overpowered by an intense\n      sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, I threw on my\n      clothes with haste (for I felt that I should sleep no more during\n      the night), and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable\n      condition into which I had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro\n      through the apartment.\n\n      I had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an\n      adjoining staircase arrested my attention. I presently recognised\n      it as that of Usher. In an instant afterward he rapped, with a\n      gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp. His\n      countenance was, as usual, cadaverously wan\u2014but, moreover, there\n      was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes\u2014an evidently restrained\n      _hysteria_ in his whole demeanor. His air appalled me\u2014but\n      anything was preferable to the solitude which I had so long\n      endured, and I even welcomed his presence as a relief.\n\n      \u201cAnd you have not seen it?\u201d he said abruptly, after having stared\n      about him for some moments in silence\u2014\u201cyou have not then seen\n      it?\u2014but, stay! you shall.\u201d Thus speaking, and having carefully\n      shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the casements, and threw it\n      freely open to the storm.\n\n      The impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our\n      feet. It was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night,\n      and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty. A whirlwind\n      had apparently collected its force in our vicinity; for there\n      were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the\n      wind; and the exceeding density of the clouds (which hung so low\n      as to press upon the turrets of the house) did not prevent our\n      perceiving the life-like velocity with which they flew careering\n      from all points against each other, without passing away into the\n      distance. I say that even their exceeding density did not prevent\n      our perceiving this\u2014yet we had no glimpse of the moon or\n      stars\u2014nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning. But the\n      under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor, as well as\n      all terrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in\n      the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible\n      gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion.\n\n      \u201cYou must not\u2014you shall not behold this!\u201d said I, shudderingly,\n      to Usher, as I led him, with a gentle violence, from the window\n      to a seat. \u201cThese appearances, which bewilder you, are merely\n      electrical phenomena not uncommon\u2014or it may be that they have\n      their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the tarn. Let us close\n      this casement;\u2014the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame.\n      Here is one of your favorite romances. I will read, and you shall\n      listen;\u2014and so we will pass away this terrible night together.\u201d\n\n      The antique volume which I had taken up was the \u201cMad Trist\u201d of\n      Sir Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favorite of Usher\u2019s\n      more in sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little\n      in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had\n      interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend. It\n      was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and I indulged a\n      vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the\n      hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history of mental\n      disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of\n      the folly which I should read. Could I have judged, indeed, by\n      the wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he harkened, or\n      apparently harkened, to the words of the tale, I might well have\n      congratulated myself upon the success of my design.\n\n      I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where\n      Ethelred, the hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for\n      peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to\n      make good an entrance by force. Here, it will be remembered, the\n      words of the narrative run thus:\n\n      \u201cAnd Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was\n      now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine\n      which he had drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the\n      hermit, who, in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn,\n      but, feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising\n      of the tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made\n      quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted\n      hand; and now pulling therewith sturdily, he so cracked, and\n      ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and\n      hollow-sounding wood alarummed and reverberated throughout the\n      forest.\u201d\n\n      At the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment,\n      paused; for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that\n      my excited fancy had deceived me)\u2014it appeared to me that, from\n      some very remote portion of the mansion, there came,\n      indistinctly, to my ears, what might have been, in its exact\n      similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled and dull one\n      certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which Sir\n      Launcelot had so particularly described. It was, beyond doubt,\n      the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid\n      the rattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary\n      commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in\n      itself, had nothing, surely, which should have interested or\n      disturbed me. I continued the story:\n\n      \u201cBut the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door,\n      was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the\n      maliceful hermit; but, in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly\n      and prodigious demeanor, and of a fiery tongue, which sate in\n      guard before a palace of gold, with a floor of silver; and upon\n      the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend\n      enwritten\u2014\n\n     Who entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin;\n     Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win;\n\n      And Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the\n      dragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with\n      a shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that\n      Ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the\n      dreadful noise of it, the like whereof was never before heard.\u201d\n\n      Here again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild\n      amazement\u2014for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this\n      instance, I did actually hear (although from what direction it\n      proceeded I found it impossible to say) a low and apparently\n      distant, but harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming or\n      grating sound\u2014the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already\n      conjured up for the dragon\u2019s unnatural shriek as described by the\n      romancer.\n\n      Oppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of this second\n      and most extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting\n      sensations, in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant,\n      I still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting,\n      by any observation, the sensitive nervousness of my companion. I\n      was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in\n      question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had, during\n      the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanor. From a\n      position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his\n      chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber; and\n      thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I saw\n      that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly. His\n      head had dropped upon his breast\u2014yet I knew that he was not\n      asleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a\n      glance of it in profile. The motion of his body, too, was at\n      variance with this idea\u2014for he rocked from side to side with a\n      gentle yet constant and uniform sway. Having rapidly taken notice\n      of all this, I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot, which thus\n      proceeded:\n\n      \u201cAnd now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of\n      the dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the\n      breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the\n      carcass from out of the way before him, and approached valorously\n      over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was\n      upon the wall; which in sooth tarried not for his full coming,\n      but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor, with a mighty\n      great and terrible ringing sound.\u201d\n\n      No sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than\u2014as if a shield\n      of brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor\n      of silver\u2014I became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and\n      clangorous, yet apparently muffled reverberation. Completely\n      unnerved, I leaped to my feet; but the measured rocking movement\n      of Usher was undisturbed. I rushed to the chair in which he sat.\n      His eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout his whole\n      countenance there reigned a stony rigidity. But, as I placed my\n      hand upon his shoulder, there came a strong shudder over his\n      whole person; a sickly smile quivered about his lips; and I saw\n      that he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur, as if\n      unconscious of my presence. Bending closely over him, I at length\n      drank in the hideous import of his words.\n\n      \u201cNot hear it?\u2014yes, I hear it, and _have_ heard it.\n      Long\u2014long\u2014long\u2014many minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard\n      it\u2014yet I dared not\u2014oh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am!\u2014I\n      dared not\u2014I _dared_ not speak! _We have put her living in the\n      tomb!_ Said I not that my senses were acute? I _now_ tell you\n      that I heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin. I\n      heard them\u2014many, many days ago\u2014yet I dared not\u2014_I dared not\n      speak!_ And now\u2014to-night\u2014Ethelred\u2014ha! ha!\u2014the breaking of the\n      hermit\u2019s door, and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangor\n      of the shield!\u2014say, rather, the rending of her coffin, and the\n      grating of the iron hinges of her prison, and her struggles\n      within the coppered archway of the vault! Oh whither shall I fly?\n      Will she not be here anon? Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for\n      my haste? Have I not heard her footstep on the stair? Do I not\n      distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart?\n      Madman!\u201d\u2014here he sprang furiously to his feet, and shrieked out\n      his syllables, as if in the effort he were giving up his\n      soul\u2014\u201c_Madman! I tell you that she now stands without the door!_\u201d\n\n      As if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been\n      found the potency of a spell\u2014the huge antique pannels to which\n      the speaker pointed, threw slowly back, upon the instant, their\n      ponderous and ebony jaws. It was the work of the rushing gust\u2014but\n      then without those doors there _did_ stand the lofty and\n      enshrouded figure of the lady Madeline of Usher. There was blood\n      upon her white robes, and the evidence of some bitter struggle\n      upon every portion of her emaciated frame. For a moment she\n      remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the\n      threshold\u2014then, with a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon\n      the person of her brother, and in her violent and now final\n      death-agonies, bore him to the floor a corpse, and a victim to\n      the terrors he had anticipated.\n\n      From that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast. The\n      storm was still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself\n      crossing the old causeway. Suddenly there shot along the path a\n      wild light, and I turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could\n      have issued; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind\n      me. The radiance was that of the full, setting, and blood-red\n      moon, which now shone vividly through that once\n      barely-discernible fissure, of which I have before spoken as\n      extending from the roof of the building, in a zigzag direction,\n      to the base. While I gazed, this fissure rapidly widened\u2014there\n      came a fierce breath of the whirlwind\u2014the entire orb of the\n      satellite burst at once upon my sight\u2014my brain reeled as I saw\n      the mighty walls rushing asunder\u2014there was a long tumultuous\n      shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters\u2014and the deep\n      and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the\n      fragments of the \u201c_House of Usher_.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSILENCE\u2014A FABLE\n\n\n     \u201cThe mountain pinnacles slumber; valleys, crags and caves _are\n     silent_.\u201d\n\n      \u201cListen to me,\u201d said the Demon as he placed his hand upon my\n      head. \u201cThe region of which I speak is a dreary region in Libya,\n      by the borders of the river Zaire. And there is no quiet there,\n      nor silence.\n\n      \u201cThe waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue; and they\n      flow not onwards to the sea, but palpitate forever and forever\n      beneath the red eye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive\n      motion. For many miles on either side of the river\u2019s oozy bed is\n      a pale desert of gigantic water-lilies. They sigh one unto the\n      other in that solitude, and stretch towards the heaven their long\n      and ghastly necks, and nod to and fro their everlasting heads.\n      And there is an indistinct murmur which cometh out from among\n      them like the rushing of subterrene water. And they sigh one unto\n      the other.\n\n      \u201cBut there is a boundary to their realm\u2014the boundary of the dark,\n      horrible, lofty forest. There, like the waves about the Hebrides,\n      the low underwood is agitated continually. But there is no wind\n      throughout the heaven. And the tall primeval trees rock eternally\n      hither and thither with a crashing and mighty sound. And from\n      their high summits, one by one, drop everlasting dews. And at the\n      roots strange poisonous flowers lie writhing in perturbed\n      slumber. And overhead, with a rustling and loud noise, the gray\n      clouds rush westwardly forever, until they roll, a cataract, over\n      the fiery wall of the horizon. But there is no wind throughout\n      the heaven. And by the shores of the river Zaire there is neither\n      quiet nor silence.\n\n      \u201cIt was night, and the rain fell; and falling, it was rain, but,\n      having fallen, it was blood. And I stood in the morass among the\n      tall and the rain fell upon my head\u2014and the lilies sighed one\n      unto the other in the solemnity of their desolation.\n\n      \u201cAnd, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist,\n      and was crimson in color. And mine eyes fell upon a huge gray\n      rock which stood by the shore of the river, and was lighted by\n      the light of the moon. And the rock was gray, and ghastly, and\n      tall,\u2014and the rock was gray. Upon its front were characters\n      engraven in the stone; and I walked through the morass of\n      water-lilies, until I came close unto the shore, that I might\n      read the characters upon the stone. But I could not decypher\n      them. And I was going back into the morass, when the moon shone\n      with a fuller red, and I turned and looked again upon the rock,\n      and upon the characters, and the characters were DESOLATION.\n\n      \u201cAnd I looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the summit of\n      the rock; and I hid myself among the water-lilies that I might\n      discover the actions of the man. And the man was tall and stately\n      in form, and was wrapped up from his shoulders to his feet in the\n      toga of old Rome. And the outlines of his figure were\n      indistinct\u2014but his features were the features of a deity; for the\n      mantle of the night, and of the mist, and of the moon, and of the\n      dew, had left uncovered the features of his face. And his brow\n      was lofty with thought, and his eye wild with care; and, in the\n      few furrows upon his cheek I read the fables of sorrow, and\n      weariness, and disgust with mankind, and a longing after\n      solitude.\n\n      \u201cAnd the man sat upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his\n      hand, and looked out upon the desolation. He looked down into the\n      low unquiet shrubbery, and up into the tall primeval trees, and\n      up higher at the rustling heaven, and into the crimson moon. And\n      I lay close within shelter of the lilies, and observed the\n      actions of the man. And the man trembled in the solitude;\u2014but the\n      night waned, and he sat upon the rock.\n\n      \u201cAnd the man turned his attention from the heaven, and looked out\n      upon the dreary river Zaire, and upon the yellow ghastly waters,\n      and upon the pale legions of the water-lilies. And the man\n      listened to the sighs of the water-lilies, and to the murmur that\n      came up from among them. And I lay close within my covert and\n      observed the actions of the man. And the man trembled in the\n      solitude;\u2014but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.\n\n      \u201cThen I went down into the recesses of the morass, and waded afar\n      in among the wilderness of the lilies, and called unto the\n      hippopotami which dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the\n      morass. And the hippopotami heard my call, and came, with the\n      behemoth, unto the foot of the rock, and roared loudly and\n      fearfully beneath the moon. And I lay close within my covert and\n      observed the actions of the man. And the man trembled in the\n      solitude;\u2014but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.\n\n      \u201cThen I cursed the elements with the curse of tumult; and a\n      frightful tempest gathered in the heaven where, before, there had\n      been no wind. And the heaven became livid with the violence of\n      the tempest\u2014and the rain beat upon the head of the man\u2014and the\n      floods of the river came down\u2014and the river was tormented into\n      foam\u2014and the water-lilies shrieked within their beds\u2014and the\n      forest crumbled before the wind\u2014and the thunder rolled\u2014and the\n      lightning fell\u2014and the rock rocked to its foundation. And I lay\n      close within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And\n      the man trembled in the solitude;\u2014but the night waned and he sat\n      upon the rock.\n\n      \u201cThen I grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, the\n      river, and the lilies, and the wind, and the forest, and the\n      heaven, and the thunder, and the sighs of the water-lilies. And\n      they became accursed, and were still. And the moon ceased to\n      totter up its pathway to heaven\u2014and the thunder died away\u2014and the\n      lightning did not flash\u2014and the clouds hung motionless\u2014and the\n      waters sunk to their level and remained\u2014and the trees ceased to\n      rock\u2014and the water-lilies sighed no more\u2014and the murmur was heard\n      no longer from among them, nor any shadow of sound throughout the\n      vast illimitable desert. And I looked upon the characters of the\n      rock, and they were changed; and the characters were SILENCE.\n\n      \u201cAnd mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man, and his\n      countenance was wan with terror. And, hurriedly, he raised his\n      head from his hand, and stood forth upon the rock and listened.\n      But there was no voice throughout the vast illimitable desert,\n      and the characters upon the rock were SILENCE. And the man\n      shuddered, and turned his face away, and fled afar off, in haste,\n      so that I beheld him no more.\u201d\n\n      Now there are fine tales in the volumes of the Magi\u2014in the\n      iron-bound, melancholy volumes of the Magi. Therein, I say, are\n      glorious histories of the Heaven, and of the Earth, and of the\n      mighty sea\u2014and of the Genii that over-ruled the sea, and the\n      earth, and the lofty heaven. There was much lore too in the\n      sayings which were said by the Sybils; and holy, holy things were\n      heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around Dodona\u2014but,\n      as Allah liveth, that fable which the Demon told me as he sat by\n      my side in the shadow of the tomb, I hold to be the most\n      wonderful of all! And as the Demon made an end of his story, he\n      fell back within the cavity of the tomb and laughed. And I could\n      not laugh with the Demon, and he cursed me because I could not\n      laugh. And the lynx which dwelleth forever in the tomb, came out\n      therefrom, and lay down at the feet of the Demon, and looked at\n      him steadily in the face.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH.\n\n\n      The \u201cRed Death\u201d had long devastated the country. No pestilence\n      had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and\n      its seal\u2014the redness and the horror of blood. There were sharp\n      pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the\n      pores, with dissolution. The scarlet stains upon the body and\n      especially upon the face of the victim, were the pest ban which\n      shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his\n      fellow-men. And the whole seizure, progress and termination of\n      the disease, were the incidents of half an hour.\n\n      But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious.\n      When his dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his\n      presence a thousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the\n      knights and dames of his court, and with these retired to the\n      deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys. This was an\n      extensive and magnificent structure, the creation of the prince\u2019s\n      own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and lofty wall girdled\n      it in. This wall had gates of iron. The courtiers, having\n      entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts.\n      They resolved to leave means neither of ingress or egress to the\n      sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within. The abbey\n      was amply provisioned. With such precautions the courtiers might\n      bid defiance to contagion. The external world could take care of\n      itself. In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or to think. The\n      prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure. There were\n      buffoons, there were improvisatori, there were ballet-dancers,\n      there were musicians, there was Beauty, there was wine. All these\n      and security were within. Without was the \u201cRed Death.\u201d\n\n      It was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his\n      seclusion, and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad,\n      that the Prince Prospero entertained his thousand friends at a\n      masked ball of the most unusual magnificence.\n\n      It was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. But first let me tell\n      of the rooms in which it was held. There were seven\u2014an imperial\n      suite. In many palaces, however, such suites form a long and\n      straight vista, while the folding doors slide back nearly to the\n      walls on either hand, so that the view of the whole extent is\n      scarcely impeded. Here the case was very different; as might have\n      been expected from the duke\u2019s love of the bizarre. The apartments\n      were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little\n      more than one at a time. There was a sharp turn at every twenty\n      or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect. To the right\n      and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic\n      window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the\n      windings of the suite. These windows were of stained glass whose\n      color varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the\n      decorations of the chamber into which it opened. That at the\n      eastern extremity was hung, for example, in blue\u2014and vividly blue\n      were its windows. The second chamber was purple in its ornaments\n      and tapestries, and here the panes were purple. The third was\n      green throughout, and so were the casements. The fourth was\n      furnished and lighted with orange\u2014the fifth with white\u2014the sixth\n      with violet. The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black\n      velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the\n      walls, falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material\n      and hue. But in this chamber only, the color of the windows\n      failed to correspond with the decorations. The panes here were\n      scarlet\u2014a deep blood color. Now in no one of the seven apartments\n      was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden\n      ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the\n      roof. There was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or\n      candle within the suite of chambers. But in the corridors that\n      followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy\n      tripod, bearing a brazier of fire that projected its rays through\n      the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room. And thus\n      were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances. But\n      in the western or black chamber the effect of the fire-light that\n      streamed upon the dark hangings through the blood-tinted panes,\n      was ghastly in the extreme, and produced so wild a look upon the\n      countenances of those who entered, that there were few of the\n      company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.\n\n      It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the\n      western wall, a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to\n      and fro with a dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the\n      minute-hand made the circuit of the face, and the hour was to be\n      stricken, there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound\n      which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical, but of\n      so peculiar a note and emphasis that, at each lapse of an hour,\n      the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause,\n      momentarily, in their performance, to hearken to the sound; and\n      thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was\n      a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the\n      chimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest\n      grew pale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over\n      their brows as if in confused reverie or meditation. But when the\n      echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the\n      assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at\n      their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each\n      to the other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce\n      in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty\n      minutes (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of\n      the Time that flies), there came yet another chiming of the\n      clock, and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and\n      meditation as before.\n\n      But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent\n      revel. The tastes of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye\n      for colors and effects. He disregarded the decora of mere\n      fashion. His plans were bold and fiery, and his conceptions\n      glowed with barbaric lustre. There are some who would have\n      thought him mad. His followers felt that he was not. It was\n      necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was\n      not.\n\n      He had directed, in great part, the moveable embellishments of\n      the seven chambers, upon occasion of this great f\u00eate; and it was\n      his own guiding taste which had given character to the\n      masqueraders. Be sure they were grotesque. There were much glare\n      and glitter and piquancy and phantasm\u2014much of what has been since\n      seen in \u201cHernani.\u201d There were arabesque figures with unsuited\n      limbs and appointments. There were delirious fancies such as the\n      madman fashions. There was much of the beautiful, much of the\n      wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the terrible, and not a\n      little of that which might have excited disgust. To and fro in\n      the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of dreams.\n      And these\u2014the dreams\u2014writhed in and about, taking hue from the\n      rooms, and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the\n      echo of their steps. And, anon, there strikes the ebony clock\n      which stands in the hall of the velvet. And then, for a moment,\n      all is still, and all is silent save the voice of the clock. The\n      dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand. But the echoes of the\n      chime die away\u2014they have endured but an instant\u2014and a light,\n      half-subdued laughter floats after them as they depart. And now\n      again the music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and\n      fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many-tinted\n      windows through which stream the rays from the tripods. But to\n      the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven, there are\n      now none of the maskers who venture; for the night is waning\n      away; and there flows a ruddier light through the blood-colored\n      panes; and the blackness of the sable drapery appals; and to him\n      whose foot falls upon the sable carpet, there comes from the near\n      clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any\n      which reaches their ears who indulge in the more remote gaieties\n      of the other apartments.\n\n      But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat\n      feverishly the heart of life. And the revel went whirlingly on,\n      until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the\n      clock. And then the music ceased, as I have told; and the\n      evolutions of the waltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy\n      cessation of all things as before. But now there were twelve\n      strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock; and thus it\n      happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with more of time,\n      into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled.\n      And thus, too, it happened, perhaps, that before the last echoes\n      of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were many\n      individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of\n      the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention\n      of no single individual before. And the rumor of this new\n      presence having spread itself whisperingly around, there arose at\n      length from the whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of\n      disapprobation and surprise\u2014then, finally, of terror, of horror,\n      and of disgust.\n\n      In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well\n      be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such\n      sensation. In truth the masquerade license of the night was\n      nearly unlimited; but the figure in question had out-Heroded\n      Herod, and gone beyond the bounds of even the prince\u2019s indefinite\n      decorum. There are chords in the hearts of the most reckless\n      which cannot be touched without emotion. Even with the utterly\n      lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are matters\n      of which no jest can be made. The whole company, indeed, seemed\n      now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the\n      stranger neither wit nor propriety existed. The figure was tall\n      and gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of\n      the grave. The mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly\n      to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the\n      closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat.\n      And yet all this might have been endured, if not approved, by the\n      mad revellers around. But the mummer had gone so far as to assume\n      the type of the Red Death. His vesture was dabbled in blood\u2014and\n      his broad brow, with all the features of the face, was\n      besprinkled with the scarlet horror.\n\n      When the eyes of Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image\n      (which with a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to\n      sustain its role, stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was\n      seen to be convulsed, in the first moment with a strong shudder\n      either of terror or distaste; but, in the next, his brow reddened\n      with rage.\n\n      \u201cWho dares?\u201d he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near\n      him\u2014\u201cwho dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery? Seize him\n      and unmask him\u2014that we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise,\n      from the battlements!\u201d\n\n      It was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince\n      Prospero as he uttered these words. They rang throughout the\n      seven rooms loudly and clearly\u2014for the prince was a bold and\n      robust man, and the music had become hushed at the waving of his\n      hand.\n\n      It was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of\n      pale courtiers by his side. At first, as he spoke, there was a\n      slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the\n      intruder, who at the moment was also near at hand, and now, with\n      deliberate and stately step, made closer approach to the speaker.\n      But from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of\n      the mummer had inspired the whole party, there were found none\n      who put forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed\n      within a yard of the prince\u2019s person; and, while the vast\n      assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of the\n      rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the\n      same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from\n      the first, through the blue chamber to the purple\u2014through the\n      purple to the green\u2014through the green to the orange\u2014through this\n      again to the white\u2014and even thence to the violet, ere a decided\n      movement had been made to arrest him. It was then, however, that\n      the Prince Prospero, maddening with rage and the shame of his own\n      momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the six chambers,\n      while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had\n      seized upon all. He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had\n      approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or four feet of\n      the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained the\n      extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted\n      his pursuer. There was a sharp cry\u2014and the dagger dropped\n      gleaming upon the sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards,\n      fell prostrate in death the Prince Prospero. Then, summoning the\n      wild courage of despair, a throng of the revellers at once threw\n      themselves into the black apartment, and, seizing the mummer,\n      whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of\n      the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at finding the\n      grave-cerements and corpse-like mask which they handled with so\n      violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form.\n\n      And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death. He had\n      come like a thief in the night. And one by one dropped the\n      revellers in the blood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died\n      each in the despairing posture of his fall. And the life of the\n      ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay. And the\n      flames of the tripods expired. And Darkness and Decay and the Red\n      Death held illimitable dominion over all.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CASK OF AMONTILLADO.\n\n\n      The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could;\n      but when he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge. You, who so\n      well know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that\n      I gave utterance to a threat. _At length_ I would be avenged;\n      this was a point definitively settled\u2014but the very definitiveness\n      with which it was resolved, precluded the idea of risk. I must\n      not only punish, but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed\n      when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally\n      unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such\n      to him who has done the wrong.\n\n      It must be understood, that neither by word nor deed had I given\n      Fortunato cause to doubt my good will. I continued, as was my\n      wont, to smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile\n      _now_ was at the thought of his immolation.\n\n      He had a weak point\u2014this Fortunato\u2014although in other regards he\n      was a man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on\n      his connoisseurship in wine. Few Italians have the true virtuoso\n      spirit. For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the\n      time and opportunity\u2014to practise imposture upon the British and\n      Austrian _millionaires_. In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like\n      his countrymen, was a quack\u2014but in the matter of old wines he was\n      sincere. In this respect I did not differ from him materially: I\n      was skilful in the Italian vintages myself, and bought largely\n      whenever I could.\n\n      It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the\n      carnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me\n      with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man\n      wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and\n      his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so\n      pleased to see him, that I thought I should never have done\n      wringing his hand.\n\n      I said to him: \u201cMy dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How\n      remarkably well you are looking to-day! But I have received a\n      pipe of what passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.\u201d\n\n      \u201cHow?\u201d said he. \u201cAmontillado? A pipe? Impossible! And in the\n      middle of the carnival!\u201d\n\n      \u201cI have my doubts,\u201d I replied; \u201cand I was silly enough to pay the\n      full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You\n      were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.\u201d\n\n      \u201cAmontillado!\u201d\n\n      \u201cI have my doubts.\u201d\n\n      \u201cAmontillado!\u201d\n\n      \u201cAnd I must satisfy them.\u201d\n\n      \u201cAmontillado!\u201d\n\n      \u201cAs you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi. If any one has a\n      critical turn, it is he. He will tell me\u2014\u201d\n\n      \u201cLuchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.\u201d\n\n      \u201cAnd yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for\n      your own.\u201d\n\n      \u201cCome, let us go.\u201d\n\n      \u201cWhither?\u201d\n\n      \u201cTo your vaults.\u201d\n\n      \u201cMy friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature. I\n      perceive you have an engagement. Luchesi\u2014\u201d\n\n      \u201cI have no engagement;\u2014come.\u201d\n\n      \u201cMy friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold\n      with which I perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are\n      insufferably damp. They are encrusted with nitre.\u201d\n\n      \u201cLet us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing.\n      Amontillado! You have been imposed upon. And as for Luchesi, he\n      cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado.\u201d\n\n      Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm. Putting on\n      a mask of black silk, and drawing a _roquelaire_ closely about my\n      person, I suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.\n\n      There were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make\n      merry in honor of the time. I had told them that I should not\n      return until the morning, and had given them explicit orders not\n      to stir from the house. These orders were sufficient, I well\n      knew, to insure their immediate disappearance, one and all, as\n      soon as my back was turned.\n\n      I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to\n      Fortunato, bowed him through several suites of rooms to the\n      archway that led into the vaults. I passed down a long and\n      winding staircase, requesting him to be cautious as he followed.\n      We came at length to the foot of the descent, and stood together\n      on the damp ground of the catacombs of the Montresors.\n\n      The gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap\n      jingled as he strode.\n\n      \u201cThe pipe,\u201d said he.\n\n      \u201cIt is farther on,\u201d said I; \u201cbut observe the white web-work which\n      gleams from these cavern walls.\u201d\n\n      He turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs\n      that distilled the rheum of intoxication.\n\n      \u201cNitre?\u201d he asked, at length.\n\n      \u201cNitre,\u201d I replied. \u201cHow long have you had that cough?\u201d\n\n      \u201cUgh! ugh! ugh!\u2014ugh! ugh! ugh!\u2014ugh! ugh! ugh!\u2014ugh! ugh! ugh!\u2014ugh!\n      ugh! ugh!\u201d\n\n      My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.\n\n      \u201cIt is nothing,\u201d he said, at last.\n\n      \u201cCome,\u201d I said, with decision, \u201cwe will go back; your health is\n      precious. You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are\n      happy, as once I was. You are a man to be missed. For me it is no\n      matter. We will go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be\n      responsible. Besides, there is Luchesi\u2014\u201d\n\n      \u201cEnough,\u201d he said; \u201cthe cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill\n      me. I shall not die of a cough.\u201d\n\n      \u201cTrue\u2014true,\u201d I replied; \u201cand, indeed, I had no intention of\n      alarming you unnecessarily\u2014but you should use all proper caution.\n      A draught of this Medoc will defend us from the damps.\u201d\n\n      Here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long\n      row of its fellows that lay upon the mould.\n\n      \u201cDrink,\u201d I said, presenting him the wine.\n\n      He raised it to his lips with a leer. He paused and nodded to me\n      familiarly, while his bells jingled.\n\n      \u201cI drink,\u201d he said, \u201cto the buried that repose around us.\u201d\n\n      \u201cAnd I to your long life.\u201d\n\n      He again took my arm, and we proceeded.\n\n      \u201cThese vaults,\u201d he said, \u201care extensive.\u201d\n\n      \u201cThe Montresors,\u201d I replied, \u201cwere a great and numerous family.\u201d\n\n      \u201cI forget your arms.\u201d\n\n      \u201cA huge human foot d\u2019or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a\n      serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.\u201d\n\n      \u201cAnd the motto?\u201d\n\n      \u201c_Nemo me impune lacessit_.\u201d\n\n      \u201cGood!\u201d he said.\n\n      The wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My own fancy\n      grew warm with the Medoc. We had passed through walls of piled\n      bones, with casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost\n      recesses of the catacombs. I paused again, and this time I made\n      bold to seize Fortunato by an arm above the elbow.\n\n      \u201cThe nitre!\u201d I said: \u201csee, it increases. It hangs like moss upon\n      the vaults. We are below the river\u2019s bed. The drops of moisture\n      trickle among the bones. Come, we will go back ere it is too\n      late. Your cough\u2014\u201d\n\n      \u201cIt is nothing,\u201d he said; \u201clet us go on. But first, another\n      draught of the Medoc.\u201d\n\n      I broke and reached him a flagon of De Gr\u00e2ve. He emptied it at a\n      breath. His eyes flashed with a fierce light. He laughed and\n      threw the bottle upwards with a gesticulation I did not\n      understand.\n\n      I looked at him in surprise. He repeated the movement\u2014a grotesque\n      one.\n\n      \u201cYou do not comprehend?\u201d he said.\n\n      \u201cNot I,\u201d I replied.\n\n      \u201cThen you are not of the brotherhood.\u201d\n\n      \u201cHow?\u201d\n\n      \u201cYou are not of the masons.\u201d\n\n      \u201cYes, yes,\u201d I said, \u201cyes, yes.\u201d\n\n      \u201cYou? Impossible! A mason?\u201d\n\n      \u201cA mason,\u201d I replied.\n\n      \u201cA sign,\u201d he said.\n\n      \u201cIt is this,\u201d I answered, producing a trowel from beneath the\n      folds of my _roquelaire_.\n\n      \u201cYou jest,\u201d he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. \u201cBut let us\n      proceed to the Amontillado.\u201d\n\n      \u201cBe it so,\u201d I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak, and\n      again offering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily. We\n      continued our route in search of the Amontillado. We passed\n      through a range of low arches, descended, passed on, and\n      descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in which the foulness\n      of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame.\n\n      At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less\n      spacious. Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to\n      the vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of\n      Paris. Three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented\n      in this manner. From the fourth the bones had been thrown down,\n      and lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a\n      mound of some size. Within the wall thus exposed by the\n      displacing of the bones, we perceived a still interior recess, in\n      depth about four feet, in width three, in height six or seven. It\n      seemed to have been constructed for no especial use in itself,\n      but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal\n      supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of\n      their circumscribing walls of solid granite.\n\n      It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch,\n      endeavored to pry into the depths of the recess. Its termination\n      the feeble light did not enable us to see.\n\n      \u201cProceed,\u201d I said; \u201cherein is the Amontillado. As for Luchesi\u2014\u201d\n\n      \u201cHe is an ignoramus,\u201d interrupted my friend, as he stepped\n      unsteadily forward, while I followed immediately at his heels. In\n      an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche, and finding\n      his progress arrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. A\n      moment more and I had fettered him to the granite. In its surface\n      were two iron staples, distant from each other about two feet,\n      horizontally. From one of these depended a short chain, from the\n      other a padlock. Throwing the links about his waist, it was but\n      the work of a few seconds to secure it. He was too much astounded\n      to resist. Withdrawing the key I stepped back from the recess.\n\n      \u201cPass your hand,\u201d I said, \u201cover the wall; you cannot help feeling\n      the nitre. Indeed it is _very_ damp. Once more let me _implore_\n      you to return. No? Then I must positively leave you. But I must\n      first render you all the little attentions in my power.\u201d\n\n      \u201cThe Amontillado!\u201d ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from\n      his astonishment.\n\n      \u201cTrue,\u201d I replied; \u201cthe Amontillado.\u201d\n\n      As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of\n      which I have before spoken. Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered\n      a quantity of building stone and mortar. With these materials and\n      with the aid of my trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the\n      entrance of the niche.\n\n      I had scarcely laid the first tier of my masonry when I\n      discovered that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great\n      measure worn off. The earliest indication I had of this was a low\n      moaning cry from the depth of the recess. It was _not_ the cry of\n      a drunken man. There was then a long and obstinate silence. I\n      laid the second tier, and the third, and the fourth; and then I\n      heard the furious vibrations of the chain. The noise lasted for\n      several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to it with\n      the more satisfaction, I ceased my labors and sat down upon the\n      bones. When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel,\n      and finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the\n      seventh tier. The wall was now nearly upon a level with my\n      breast. I again paused, and holding the flambeaux over the\n      mason-work, threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within.\n\n      A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from\n      the throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently\n      back. For a brief moment I hesitated\u2014I trembled. Unsheathing my\n      rapier, I began to grope with it about the recess; but the\n      thought of an instant reassured me. I placed my hand upon the\n      solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt satisfied. I reapproached\n      the wall. I replied to the yells of him who clamored. I\n      re-echoed\u2014I aided\u2014I surpassed them in volume and in strength. I\n      did this, and the clamorer grew still.\n\n      It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. I had\n      completed the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier. I had\n      finished a portion of the last and the eleventh; there remained\n      but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in. I struggled\n      with its weight; I placed it partially in its destined position.\n      But now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected\n      the hairs upon my head. It was succeeded by a sad voice, which I\n      had difficulty in recognising as that of the noble Fortunato. The\n      voice said\u2014\n\n      \u201cHa! ha! ha!\u2014he! he!\u2014a very good joke indeed\u2014an excellent jest.\n      We will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo\u2014he! he!\n      he!\u2014over our wine\u2014he! he! he!\u201d\n\n      \u201cThe Amontillado!\u201d I said.\n\n      \u201cHe! he! he!\u2014he! he! he!\u2014yes, the Amontillado. But is it not\n      getting late? Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the\n      Lady Fortunato and the rest? Let us be gone.\u201d\n\n      \u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201clet us be gone.\u201d\n\n      \u201c_For the love of God, Montressor!_\u201d\n\n      \u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cfor the love of God!\u201d\n\n      But to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew\n      impatient. I called aloud\u2014\n\n      \u201cFortunato!\u201d\n\n      No answer. I called again\u2014\n\n      \u201cFortunato!\u201d\n\n      No answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture\n      and let it fall within. There came forth in return only a\n      jingling of the bells. My heart grew sick\u2014on account of the\n      dampness of the catacombs. I hastened to make an end of my labor.\n      I forced the last stone into its position; I plastered it up.\n      Against the new masonry I re-erected the old rampart of bones.\n      For the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them. _In pace\n      requiescat!_\n\n\n\n\nTHE IMP OF THE PERVERSE\n\n\n      In the consideration of the faculties and impulses\u2014of the prima\n      mobilia of the human soul, the phrenologists have failed to make\n      room for a propensity which, although obviously existing as a\n      radical, primitive, irreducible sentiment, has been equally\n      overlooked by all the moralists who have preceded them. In the\n      pure arrogance of the reason, we have all overlooked it. We have\n      suffered its existence to escape our senses, solely through want\n      of belief\u2014of faith;\u2014whether it be faith in Revelation, or faith\n      in the Kabbala. The idea of it has never occurred to us, simply\n      because of its supererogation. We saw no need of the impulse\u2014for\n      the propensity. We could not perceive its necessity. We could not\n      understand, that is to say, we could not have understood, had the\n      notion of this primum mobile ever obtruded itself;\u2014we could not\n      have understood in what manner it might be made to further the\n      objects of humanity, either temporal or eternal. It cannot be\n      denied that phrenology and, in great measure, all\n      metaphysicianism have been concocted a priori. The intellectual\n      or logical man, rather than the understanding or observant man,\n      set himself to imagine designs\u2014to dictate purposes to God. Having\n      thus fathomed, to his satisfaction, the intentions of Jehovah,\n      out of these intentions he built his innumerable systems of mind.\n      In the matter of phrenology, for example, we first determined,\n      naturally enough, that it was the design of the Deity that man\n      should eat. We then assigned to man an organ of alimentiveness,\n      and this organ is the scourge with which the Deity compels man,\n      will-I nill-I, into eating. Secondly, having settled it to be\n      God\u2019s will that man should continue his species, we discovered an\n      organ of amativeness, forthwith. And so with combativeness, with\n      ideality, with causality, with constructiveness,\u2014so, in short,\n      with every organ, whether representing a propensity, a moral\n      sentiment, or a faculty of the pure intellect. And in these\n      arrangements of the Principia of human action, the Spurzheimites,\n      whether right or wrong, in part, or upon the whole, have but\n      followed, in principle, the footsteps of their predecessors;\n      deducing and establishing every thing from the preconceived\n      destiny of man, and upon the ground of the objects of his\n      Creator.\n\n      It would have been wiser, it would have been safer, to classify\n      (if classify we must) upon the basis of what man usually or\n      occasionally did, and was always occasionally doing, rather than\n      upon the basis of what we took it for granted the Deity intended\n      him to do. If we cannot comprehend God in his visible works, how\n      then in his inconceivable thoughts, that call the works into\n      being? If we cannot understand him in his objective creatures,\n      how then in his substantive moods and phases of creation?\n\n      Induction, _a posteriori_, would have brought phrenology to\n      admit, as an innate and primitive principle of human action, a\n      paradoxical something, which we may call _perverseness_, for want\n      of a more characteristic term. In the sense I intend, it is, in\n      fact, a _mobile_ without motive, a motive not _motivirt_. Through\n      its promptings we act without comprehensible object; or, if this\n      shall be understood as a contradiction in terms, we may so far\n      modify the proposition as to say, that through its promptings we\n      act, for the reason that we should _not_. In theory, no reason\n      can be more unreasonable, but, in fact, there is none more\n      strong. With certain minds, under certain conditions, it becomes\n      absolutely irresistible. I am not more certain that I breathe,\n      than that the assurance of the wrong or error of any action is\n      often the one unconquerable _force_ which impels us, and alone\n      impels us to its prosecution. Nor will this overwhelming tendency\n      to do wrong for the wrong\u2019s sake, admit of analysis, or\n      resolution into ulterior elements. It is a radical, a primitive\n      impulse\u2014elementary. It will be said, I am aware, that when we\n      persist in acts because we feel we should not persist in them,\n      our conduct is but a modification of that which ordinarily\n      springs from the combativeness of phrenology. But a glance will\n      show the fallacy of this idea. The phrenological combativeness\n      has for its essence, the necessity of self-defence. It is our\n      safeguard against injury. Its principle regards our well-being;\n      and thus the desire to be well is excited simultaneously with its\n      development. It follows, that the desire to be well must be\n      excited simultaneously with any principle which shall be merely a\n      modification of combativeness, but in the case of that something\n      which I term perverseness, the desire to be well is not only not\n      aroused, but a strongly antagonistical sentiment exists.\n\n      An appeal to one\u2019s own heart is, after all, the best reply to the\n      sophistry just noticed. No one who trustingly consults and\n      thoroughly questions his own soul, will be disposed to deny the\n      entire radicalness of the propensity in question. It is not more\n      incomprehensible than distinctive. There lives no man who at some\n      period has not been tormented, for example, by an earnest desire\n      to tantalize a listener by circumlocution. The speaker is aware\n      that he displeases; he has every intention to please, he is\n      usually curt, precise, and clear; the most laconic and luminous\n      language is struggling for utterance upon his tongue; it is only\n      with difficulty that he restrains himself from giving it flow; he\n      dreads and deprecates the anger of him whom he addresses; yet,\n      the thought strikes him, that by certain involutions and\n      parentheses this anger may be engendered. That single thought is\n      enough. The impulse increases to a wish, the wish to a desire,\n      the desire to an uncontrollable longing, and the longing (to the\n      deep regret and mortification of the speaker, and in defiance of\n      all consequences) is indulged.\n\n      We have a task before us which must be speedily performed. We\n      know that it will be ruinous to make delay. The most important\n      crisis of our life calls, trumpet-tongued, for immediate energy\n      and action. We glow, we are consumed with eagerness to commence\n      the work, with the anticipation of whose glorious result our\n      whole souls are on fire. It must, it shall be undertaken to-day,\n      and yet we put it off until to-morrow; and why? There is no\n      answer, except that we feel perverse, using the word with no\n      comprehension of the principle. To-morrow arrives, and with it a\n      more impatient anxiety to do our duty, but with this very\n      increase of anxiety arrives, also, a nameless, a positively\n      fearful, because unfathomable, craving for delay. This craving\n      gathers strength as the moments fly. The last hour for action is\n      at hand. We tremble with the violence of the conflict within\n      us,\u2014of the definite with the indefinite\u2014of the substance with the\n      shadow. But, if the contest have proceeded thus far, it is the\n      shadow which prevails,\u2014we struggle in vain. The clock strikes,\n      and is the knell of our welfare. At the same time, it is the\n      chanticleer-note to the ghost that has so long overawed us. It\n      flies\u2014it disappears\u2014we are free. The old energy returns. We will\n      labor now. Alas, it is too late!\n\n      We stand upon the brink of a precipice. We peer into the abyss\u2014we\n      grow sick and dizzy. Our first impulse is to shrink from the\n      danger. Unaccountably we remain. By slow degrees our sickness and\n      dizziness and horror become merged in a cloud of unnamable\n      feeling. By gradations, still more imperceptible, this cloud\n      assumes shape, as did the vapor from the bottle out of which\n      arose the genius in the Arabian Nights. But out of this our cloud\n      upon the precipice\u2019s edge, there grows into palpability, a shape,\n      far more terrible than any genius or any demon of a tale, and yet\n      it is but a thought, although a fearful one, and one which chills\n      the very marrow of our bones with the fierceness of the delight\n      of its horror. It is merely the idea of what would be our\n      sensations during the sweeping precipitancy of a fall from such a\n      height. And this fall\u2014this rushing annihilation\u2014for the very\n      reason that it involves that one most ghastly and loathsome of\n      all the most ghastly and loathsome images of death and suffering\n      which have ever presented themselves to our imagination\u2014for this\n      very cause do we now the most vividly desire it. And because our\n      reason violently deters us from the brink, therefore do we the\n      most impetuously approach it. There is no passion in nature so\n      demoniacally impatient, as that of him who, shuddering upon the\n      edge of a precipice, thus meditates a plunge. To indulge, for a\n      moment, in any attempt at thought, is to be inevitably lost; for\n      reflection but urges us to forbear, and therefore it is, I say,\n      that we cannot. If there be no friendly arm to check us, or if we\n      fail in a sudden effort to prostrate ourselves backward from the\n      abyss, we plunge, and are destroyed.\n\n      Examine these similar actions as we will, we shall find them\n      resulting solely from the spirit of the Perverse. We perpetrate\n      them because we feel that we should not. Beyond or behind this\n      there is no intelligible principle; and we might, indeed, deem\n      this perverseness a direct instigation of the Arch-Fiend, were it\n      not occasionally known to operate in furtherance of good.\n\n      I have said thus much, that in some measure I may answer your\n      question\u2014that I may explain to you why I am here\u2014that I may\n      assign to you something that shall have at least the faint aspect\n      of a cause for my wearing these fetters, and for my tenanting\n      this cell of the condemned. Had I not been thus prolix, you might\n      either have misunderstood me altogether, or, with the rabble,\n      have fancied me mad. As it is, you will easily perceive that I am\n      one of the many uncounted victims of the Imp of the Perverse.\n\n      It is impossible that any deed could have been wrought with a\n      more thorough deliberation. For weeks, for months, I pondered\n      upon the means of the murder. I rejected a thousand schemes,\n      because their accomplishment involved a _chance_ of detection. At\n      length, in reading some French memoirs, I found an account of a\n      nearly fatal illness that occurred to Madame Pilau, through the\n      agency of a candle accidentally poisoned. The idea struck my\n      fancy at once. I knew my victim\u2019s habit of reading in bed. I\n      knew, too, that his apartment was narrow and ill-ventilated. But\n      I need not vex you with impertinent details. I need not describe\n      the easy artifices by which I substituted, in his bed-room\n      candle-stand, a wax-light of my own making for the one which I\n      there found. The next morning he was discovered dead in his bed,\n      and the coroner\u2019s verdict was\u2014\u201cDeath by the visitation of God.\u201d\n\n      Having inherited his estate, all went well with me for years. The\n      idea of detection never once entered my brain. Of the remains of\n      the fatal taper I had myself carefully disposed. I had left no\n      shadow of a clew by which it would be possible to convict, or\n      even to suspect me of the crime. It is inconceivable how rich a\n      sentiment of satisfaction arose in my bosom as I reflected upon\n      my absolute security. For a very long period of time I was\n      accustomed to revel in this sentiment. It afforded me more real\n      delight than all the mere worldly advantages accruing from my\n      sin. But there arrived at length an epoch, from which the\n      pleasurable feeling grew, by scarcely perceptible gradations,\n      into a haunting and harassing thought. It harassed because it\n      haunted. I could scarcely get rid of it for an instant. It is\n      quite a common thing to be thus annoyed with the ringing in our\n      ears, or rather in our memories, of the burthen of some ordinary\n      song, or some unimpressive snatches from an opera. Nor will we be\n      the less tormented if the song in itself be good, or the opera\n      air meritorious. In this manner, at last, I would perpetually\n      catch myself pondering upon my security, and repeating, in a low\n      undertone, the phrase, \u201cI am safe.\u201d\n\n      One day, whilst sauntering along the streets, I arrested myself\n      in the act of murmuring, half aloud, these customary syllables.\n      In a fit of petulance, I remodelled them thus: \u201cI am safe\u2014I am\n      safe\u2014yes\u2014if I be not fool enough to make open confession!\u201d\n\n      No sooner had I spoken these words, than I felt an icy chill\n      creep to my heart. I had had some experience in these fits of\n      perversity (whose nature I have been at some trouble to explain),\n      and I remembered well that in no instance I had successfully\n      resisted their attacks. And now my own casual self-suggestion\n      that I might possibly be fool enough to confess the murder of\n      which I had been guilty, confronted me, as if the very ghost of\n      him whom I had murdered\u2014and beckoned me on to death.\n\n      At first, I made an effort to shake off this nightmare of the\n      soul. I walked vigorously\u2014faster\u2014still faster\u2014at length I ran. I\n      felt a maddening desire to shriek aloud. Every succeeding wave of\n      thought overwhelmed me with new terror, for, alas! I well, too\n      well understood that to think, in my situation, was to be lost. I\n      still quickened my pace. I bounded like a madman through the\n      crowded thoroughfares. At length, the populace took the alarm,\n      and pursued me. I felt then the consummation of my fate. Could I\n      have torn out my tongue, I would have done it, but a rough voice\n      resounded in my ears\u2014a rougher grasp seized me by the shoulder. I\n      turned\u2014I gasped for breath. For a moment I experienced all the\n      pangs of suffocation; I became blind, and deaf, and giddy; and\n      then some invisible fiend, I thought, struck me with his broad\n      palm upon the back. The long imprisoned secret burst forth from\n      my soul.\n\n      They say that I spoke with a distinct enunciation, but with\n      marked emphasis and passionate hurry, as if in dread of\n      interruption before concluding the brief but pregnant sentences\n      that consigned me to the hangman and to hell.\n\n      Having related all that was necessary for the fullest judicial\n      conviction, I fell prostrate in a swoon.\n\n      But why shall I say more? To-day I wear these chains, and am\n      _here!_ To-morrow I shall be fetterless!\u2014_but where?_\n\n\n\n\nTHE ISLAND OF THE FAY\n\n\nNullus enim locus sine genio est.\u2014_Servius_.\n\n      \u201cLa musique,\u201d says Marmontel, in those \u201cContes Moraux\u201d (*1) which\n      in all our translations, we have insisted upon calling \u201cMoral\n      Tales,\u201d as if in mockery of their spirit\u2014\u201cla musique est le seul\n      des talents qui jouissent de lui-m\u00eame; tous les autres veulent\n      des temoins.\u201d He here confounds the pleasure derivable from sweet\n      sounds with the capacity for creating them. No more than any\n      other talent, is that for music susceptible of complete\n      enjoyment, where there is no second party to appreciate its\n      exercise. And it is only in common with other talents that it\n      produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude. The idea\n      which the raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly, or\n      has sacrificed in its expression to his national love of point,\n      is, doubtless, the very tenable one that the higher order of\n      music is the most thoroughly estimated when we are exclusively\n      alone. The proposition, in this form, will be admitted at once by\n      those who love the lyre for its own sake, and for its spiritual\n      uses. But there is one pleasure still within the reach of fallen\n      mortality and perhaps only one\u2014which owes even more than does\n      music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion. I mean the\n      happiness experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery. In\n      truth, the man who would behold aright the glory of God upon\n      earth must in solitude behold that glory. To me, at least, the\n      presence\u2014not of human life only, but of life in any other form\n      than that of the green things which grow upon the soil and are\n      voiceless\u2014is a stain upon the landscape\u2014is at war with the genius\n      of the scene. I love, indeed, to regard the dark valleys, and the\n      gray rocks, and the waters that silently smile, and the forests\n      that sigh in uneasy slumbers, and the proud watchful mountains\n      that look down upon all,\u2014I love to regard these as themselves but\n      the colossal members of one vast animate and sentient whole\u2014a\n      whole whose form (that of the sphere) is the most perfect and\n      most inclusive of all; whose path is among associate planets;\n      whose meek handmaiden is the moon, whose mediate sovereign is the\n      sun; whose life is eternity, whose thought is that of a God;\n      whose enjoyment is knowledge; whose destinies are lost in\n      immensity, whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own\n      cognizance of the animalculae which infest the brain\u2014a being\n      which we, in consequence, regard as purely inanimate and material\n      much in the same manner as these animalculae must thus regard us.\n\n      Our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on\n      every hand\u2014notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the\n      priesthood\u2014that space, and therefore that bulk, is an important\n      consideration in the eyes of the Almighty. The cycles in which\n      the stars move are those best adapted for the evolution, without\n      collision, of the greatest possible number of bodies. The forms\n      of those bodies are accurately such as, within a given surface,\n      to include the greatest possible amount of matter;\u2014while the\n      surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate a denser\n      population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces\n      otherwise arranged. Nor is it any argument against bulk being an\n      object with God, that space itself is infinite; for there may be\n      an infinity of matter to fill it. And since we see clearly that\n      the endowment of matter with vitality is a principle\u2014indeed, as\n      far as our judgments extend, the leading principle in the\n      operations of Deity,\u2014it is scarcely logical to imagine it\n      confined to the regions of the minute, where we daily trace it,\n      and not extending to those of the august. As we find cycle within\n      cycle without end,\u2014yet all revolving around one far-distant\n      centre which is the God-head, may we not analogically suppose in\n      the same manner, life within life, the less within the greater,\n      and all within the Spirit Divine? In short, we are madly erring,\n      through self-esteem, in believing man, in either his temporal or\n      future destinies, to be of more moment in the universe than that\n      vast \u201cclod of the valley\u201d which he tills and contemns, and to\n      which he denies a soul for no more profound reason than that he\n      does not behold it in operation. (*2)\n\n      These fancies, and such as these, have always given to my\n      meditations among the mountains and the forests, by the rivers\n      and the ocean, a tinge of what the everyday world would not fail\n      to term fantastic. My wanderings amid such scenes have been many,\n      and far-searching, and often solitary; and the interest with\n      which I have strayed through many a dim, deep valley, or gazed\n      into the reflected Heaven of many a bright lake, has been an\n      interest greatly deepened by the thought that I have strayed and\n      gazed alone. What flippant Frenchman was it who said in allusion\n      to the well-known work of Zimmerman, that, \u201cla solitude est une\n      belle chose; mais il faut quelqu\u2019un pour vous dire que la\n      solitude est une belle chose?\u201d The epigram cannot be gainsayed;\n      but the necessity is a thing that does not exist.\n\n      It was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far distant\n      region of mountain locked within mountain, and sad rivers and\n      melancholy tarn writhing or sleeping within all\u2014that I chanced\n      upon a certain rivulet and island. I came upon them suddenly in\n      the leafy June, and threw myself upon the turf, beneath the\n      branches of an unknown odorous shrub, that I might doze as I\n      contemplated the scene. I felt that thus only should I look upon\n      it\u2014such was the character of phantasm which it wore.\n\n      On all sides\u2014save to the west, where the sun was about\n      sinking\u2014arose the verdant walls of the forest. The little river\n      which turned sharply in its course, and was thus immediately lost\n      to sight, seemed to have no exit from its prison, but to be\n      absorbed by the deep green foliage of the trees to the east\u2014while\n      in the opposite quarter (so it appeared to me as I lay at length\n      and glanced upward) there poured down noiselessly and\n      continuously into the valley, a rich golden and crimson waterfall\n      from the sunset fountains of the sky.\n\n      About midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in,\n      one small circular island, profusely verdured, reposed upon the\n      bosom of the stream.\n\n      So blended bank and shadow there\n      That each seemed pendulous in air\u2014\n\n      so mirror-like was the glassy water, that it was scarcely\n      possible to say at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf\n      its crystal dominion began.\n\n      My position enabled me to include in a single view both the\n      eastern and western extremities of the islet; and I observed a\n      singularly-marked difference in their aspects. The latter was all\n      one radiant harem of garden beauties. It glowed and blushed\n      beneath the eyes of the slant sunlight, and fairly laughed with\n      flowers. The grass was short, springy, sweet-scented, and\n      asphodel-interspersed. The trees were lithe, mirthful,\n      erect\u2014bright, slender, and graceful,\u2014of Eastern figure and\n      foliage, with bark smooth, glossy, and parti-colored. There\n      seemed a deep sense of life and joy about all; and although no\n      airs blew from out the heavens, yet every thing had motion\n      through the gentle sweepings to and fro of innumerable\n      butterflies, that might have been mistaken for tulips with wings.\n      (*4)\n\n      The other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest\n      shade. A sombre, yet beautiful and peaceful gloom here pervaded\n      all things. The trees were dark in color, and mournful in form\n      and attitude, wreathing themselves into sad, solemn, and spectral\n      shapes that conveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death.\n      The grass wore the deep tint of the cypress, and the heads of its\n      blades hung droopingly, and hither and thither among it were many\n      small unsightly hillocks, low and narrow, and not very long, that\n      had the aspect of graves, but were not; although over and all\n      about them the rue and the rosemary clambered. The shade of the\n      trees fell heavily upon the water, and seemed to bury itself\n      therein, impregnating the depths of the element with darkness. I\n      fancied that each shadow, as the sun descended lower and lower,\n      separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth, and\n      thus became absorbed by the stream; while other shadows issued\n      momently from the trees, taking the place of their predecessors\n      thus entombed.\n\n      This idea, having once seized upon my fancy, greatly excited it,\n      and I lost myself forthwith in revery. \u201cIf ever island were\n      enchanted,\u201d said I to myself, \u201cthis is it. This is the haunt of\n      the few gentle Fays who remain from the wreck of the race. Are\n      these green tombs theirs?\u2014or do they yield up their sweet lives\n      as mankind yield up their own? In dying, do they not rather waste\n      away mournfully, rendering unto God, little by little, their\n      existence, as these trees render up shadow after shadow,\n      exhausting their substance unto dissolution? What the wasting\n      tree is to the water that imbibes its shade, growing thus blacker\n      by what it preys upon, may not the life of the Fay be to the\n      death which engulfs it?\u201d\n\n      As I thus mused, with half-shut eyes, while the sun sank rapidly\n      to rest, and eddying currents careered round and round the\n      island, bearing upon their bosom large, dazzling, white flakes of\n      the bark of the sycamore\u2014flakes which, in their multiform\n      positions upon the water, a quick imagination might have\n      converted into anything it pleased\u2014while I thus mused, it\n      appeared to me that the form of one of those very Fays about whom\n      I had been pondering made its way slowly into the darkness from\n      out the light at the western end of the island. She stood erect\n      in a singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom\n      of an oar. While within the influence of the lingering sunbeams,\n      her attitude seemed indicative of joy\u2014but sorrow deformed it as\n      she passed within the shade. Slowly she glided along, and at\n      length rounded the islet and re-entered the region of light. \u201cThe\n      revolution which has just been made by the Fay,\u201d continued I,\n      musingly, \u201cis the cycle of the brief year of her life. She has\n      floated through her winter and through her summer. She is a year\n      nearer unto Death; for I did not fail to see that, as she came\n      into the shade, her shadow fell from her, and was swallowed up in\n      the dark water, making its blackness more black.\u201d\n\n      And again the boat appeared and the Fay; but about the attitude\n      of the latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of\n      elastic joy. She floated again from out the light and into the\n      gloom (which deepened momently) and again her shadow fell from\n      her into the ebony water, and became absorbed into its blackness.\n      And again and again she made the circuit of the island, (while\n      the sun rushed down to his slumbers), and at each issuing into\n      the light there was more sorrow about her person, while it grew\n      feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at each passage\n      into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade, which became\n      whelmed in a shadow more black. But at length when the sun had\n      utterly departed, the Fay, now the mere ghost of her former self,\n      went disconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony\n      flood\u2014and that she issued thence at all I cannot say, for\n      darkness fell over all things and I beheld her magical figure no\n      more.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ASSIGNATION\n\n\n     Stay for me there! I will not fail.\n     To meet thee in that hollow vale.\n\n(_Exequy on the death of his wife, by Henry King, Bishop of\nChichester_.)\n\n      Ill-fated and mysterious man!\u2014bewildered in the brilliancy of\n      thine own imagination, and fallen in the flames of thine own\n      youth! Again in fancy I behold thee! Once more thy form hath\n      risen before me!\u2014not\u2014oh! not as thou art\u2014in the cold valley and\n      shadow\u2014but as thou _shouldst be_\u2014squandering away a life of\n      magnificent meditation in that city of dim visions, thine own\n      Venice\u2014which is a star-beloved Elysium of the sea, and the wide\n      windows of whose Palladian palaces look down with a deep and\n      bitter meaning upon the secrets of her silent waters. Yes! I\n      repeat it\u2014as thou _shouldst be_. There are surely other worlds\n      than this\u2014other thoughts than the thoughts of the multitude\u2014other\n      speculations than the speculations of the sophist. Who then shall\n      call thy conduct into question? who blame thee for thy visionary\n      hours, or denounce those occupations as a wasting away of life,\n      which were but the overflowings of thine everlasting energies?\n\n      It was at Venice, beneath the covered archway there called the\n      _Ponte di Sospiri_, that I met for the third or fourth time the\n      person of whom I speak. It is with a confused recollection that I\n      bring to mind the circumstances of that meeting. Yet I\n      remember\u2014ah! how should I forget?\u2014the deep midnight, the Bridge\n      of Sighs, the beauty of woman, and the Genius of Romance that\n      stalked up and down the narrow canal.\n\n      It was a night of unusual gloom. The great clock of the Piazza\n      had sounded the fifth hour of the Italian evening. The square of\n      the Campanile lay silent and deserted, and the lights in the old\n      Ducal Palace were dying fast away. I was returning home from the\n      Piazetta, by way of the Grand Canal. But as my gondola arrived\n      opposite the mouth of the canal San Marco, a female voice from\n      its recesses broke suddenly upon the night, in one wild,\n      hysterical, and long continued shriek. Startled at the sound, I\n      sprang upon my feet: while the gondolier, letting slip his single\n      oar, lost it in the pitchy darkness beyond a chance of recovery,\n      and we were consequently left to the guidance of the current\n      which here sets from the greater into the smaller channel. Like\n      some huge and sable-feathered condor, we were slowly drifting\n      down towards the Bridge of Sighs, when a thousand flambeaux\n      flashing from the windows, and down the staircases of the Ducal\n      Palace, turned all at once that deep gloom into a livid and\n      preternatural day.\n\n      A child, slipping from the arms of its own mother, had fallen\n      from an upper window of the lofty structure into the deep and dim\n      canal. The quiet waters had closed placidly over their victim;\n      and, although my own gondola was the only one in sight, many a\n      stout swimmer, already in the stream, was seeking in vain upon\n      the surface, the treasure which was to be found, alas! only\n      within the abyss. Upon the broad black marble flagstones at the\n      entrance of the palace, and a few steps above the water, stood a\n      figure which none who then saw can have ever since forgotten. It\n      was the Marchesa Aphrodite\u2014the adoration of all Venice\u2014the gayest\n      of the gay\u2014the most lovely where all were beautiful\u2014but still the\n      young wife of the old and intriguing Mentoni, and the mother of\n      that fair child, her first and only one, who now, deep beneath\n      the murky water, was thinking in bitterness of heart upon her\n      sweet caresses, and exhausting its little life in struggles to\n      call upon her name.\n\n      She stood alone. Her small, bare, and silvery feet gleamed in the\n      black mirror of marble beneath her. Her hair, not as yet more\n      than half loosened for the night from its ball-room array,\n      clustered, amid a shower of diamonds, round and round her\n      classical head, in curls like those of the young hyacinth. A\n      snowy-white and gauze-like drapery seemed to be nearly the sole\n      covering to her delicate form; but the mid-summer and midnight\n      air was hot, sullen, and still, and no motion in the statue-like\n      form itself, stirred even the folds of that raiment of very vapor\n      which hung around it as the heavy marble hangs around the Niobe.\n      Yet\u2014strange to say!\u2014her large lustrous eyes were not turned\n      downwards upon that grave wherein her brightest hope lay\n      buried\u2014but riveted in a widely different direction! The prison of\n      the Old Republic is, I think, the stateliest building in all\n      Venice\u2014but how could that lady gaze so fixedly upon it, when\n      beneath her lay stifling her only child? Yon dark, gloomy niche,\n      too, yawns right opposite her chamber window\u2014what, then, _could_\n      there be in its shadows\u2014in its architecture\u2014in its ivy-wreathed\n      and solemn cornices\u2014that the Marchesa di Mentoni had not wondered\n      at a thousand times before? Nonsense!\u2014Who does not remember that,\n      at such a time as this, the eye, like a shattered mirror,\n      multiplies the images of its sorrow, and sees in innumerable\n      far-off places, the woe which is close at hand?\n\n      Many steps above the Marchesa, and within the arch of the\n      water-gate, stood, in full dress, the Satyr-like figure of\n      Mentoni himself. He was occasionally occupied in thrumming a\n      guitar, and seemed _ennuye_ to the very death, as at intervals he\n      gave directions for the recovery of his child. Stupefied and\n      aghast, I had myself no power to move from the upright position I\n      had assumed upon first hearing the shriek, and must have\n      presented to the eyes of the agitated group a spectral and\n      ominous appearance, as with pale countenance and rigid limbs, I\n      floated down among them in that funereal gondola.\n\n      All efforts proved in vain. Many of the most energetic in the\n      search were relaxing their exertions, and yielding to a gloomy\n      sorrow. There seemed but little hope for the child; (how much\n      less than for the mother!) but now, from the interior of that\n      dark niche which has been already mentioned as forming a part of\n      the Old Republican prison, and as fronting the lattice of the\n      Marchesa, a figure muffled in a cloak, stepped out within reach\n      of the light, and, pausing a moment upon the verge of the giddy\n      descent, plunged headlong into the canal. As, in an instant\n      afterwards, he stood with the still living and breathing child\n      within his grasp, upon the marble flagstones by the side of the\n      Marchesa, his cloak, heavy with the drenching water, became\n      unfastened, and, falling in folds about his feet, discovered to\n      the wonder-stricken spectators the graceful person of a very\n      young man, with the sound of whose name the greater part of\n      Europe was then ringing.\n\n      No word spoke the deliverer. But the Marchesa! She will now\n      receive her child\u2014she will press it to her heart\u2014she will cling\n      to its little form, and smother it with her caresses. Alas!\n      _another\u2019s_ arms have taken it from the stranger\u2014_another\u2019s_ arms\n      have taken it away, and borne it afar off, unnoticed, into the\n      palace! And the Marchesa! Her lip\u2014her beautiful lip trembles;\n      tears are gathering in her eyes\u2014those eyes which, like Pliny\u2019s\n      acanthus, are \u201csoft and almost liquid.\u201d Yes! tears are gathering\n      in those eyes\u2014and see! the entire woman thrills throughout the\n      soul, and the statue has started into life! The pallor of the\n      marble countenance, the swelling of the marble bosom, the very\n      purity of the marble feet, we behold suddenly flushed over with a\n      tide of ungovernable crimson; and a slight shudder quivers about\n      her delicate frame, as a gentle air at Napoli about the rich\n      silver lilies in the grass.\n\n      Why _should_ that lady blush! To this demand there is no\n      answer\u2014except that, having left, in the eager haste and terror of\n      a mother\u2019s heart, the privacy of her own _boudoir_, she has\n      neglected to enthral her tiny feet in their slippers, and utterly\n      forgotten to throw over her Venetian shoulders that drapery which\n      is their due. What other possible reason could there have been\n      for her so blushing?\u2014for the glance of those wild appealing\n      eyes?\u2014for the unusual tumult of that throbbing bosom?\u2014for the\n      convulsive pressure of that trembling hand?\u2014that hand which fell,\n      as Mentoni turned into the palace, accidentally, upon the hand of\n      the stranger. What reason could there have been for the low\u2014the\n      singularly low tone of those unmeaning words which the lady\n      uttered hurriedly in bidding him adieu? \u201cThou hast conquered,\u201d\n      she said, or the murmurs of the water deceived me; \u201cthou hast\n      conquered\u2014one hour after sunrise\u2014we shall meet\u2014so let it be!\u201d\n\n      The tumult had subsided, the lights had died away within the\n      palace, and the stranger, whom I now recognized, stood alone upon\n      the flags. He shook with inconceivable agitation, and his eye\n      glanced around in search of a gondola. I could not do less than\n      offer him the service of my own; and he accepted the civility.\n      Having obtained an oar at the water-gate, we proceeded together\n      to his residence, while he rapidly recovered his self-possession,\n      and spoke of our former slight acquaintance in terms of great\n      apparent cordiality.\n\n      There are some subjects upon which I take pleasure in being\n      minute. The person of the stranger\u2014let me call him by this title,\n      who to all the world was still a stranger\u2014the person of the\n      stranger is one of these subjects. In height he might have been\n      below rather than above the medium size: although there were\n      moments of intense passion when his frame actually _expanded_ and\n      belied the assertion. The light, almost slender symmetry of his\n      figure, promised more of that ready activity which he evinced at\n      the Bridge of Sighs, than of that Herculean strength which he has\n      been known to wield without an effort, upon occasions of more\n      dangerous emergency. With the mouth and chin of a deity\u2014singular,\n      wild, full, liquid eyes, whose shadows varied from pure hazel to\n      intense and brilliant jet\u2014and a profusion of curling, black hair,\n      from which a forehead of unusual breadth gleamed forth at\n      intervals all light and ivory\u2014his were features than which I have\n      seen none more classically regular, except, perhaps, the marble\n      ones of the Emperor Commodus. Yet his countenance was,\n      nevertheless, one of those which all men have seen at some period\n      of their lives, and have never afterwards seen again. It had no\n      peculiar, it had no settled predominant expression to be fastened\n      upon the memory; a countenance seen and instantly forgotten, but\n      forgotten with a vague and never-ceasing desire of recalling it\n      to mind. Not that the spirit of each rapid passion failed, at any\n      time, to throw its own distinct image upon the mirror of that\n      face\u2014but that the mirror, mirror-like, retained no vestige of the\n      passion, when the passion had departed.\n\n      Upon leaving him on the night of our adventure, he solicited me,\n      in what I thought an urgent manner, to call upon him _very_ early\n      the next morning. Shortly after sunrise, I found myself\n      accordingly at his Palazzo, one of those huge structures of\n      gloomy, yet fantastic pomp, which tower above the waters of the\n      Grand Canal in the vicinity of the Rialto. I was shown up a broad\n      winding staircase of mosaics, into an apartment whose\n      unparalleled splendor burst through the opening door with an\n      actual glare, making me blind and dizzy with luxuriousness.\n\n      I knew my acquaintance to be wealthy. Report had spoken of his\n      possessions in terms which I had even ventured to call terms of\n      ridiculous exaggeration. But as I gazed about me, I could not\n      bring myself to believe that the wealth of any subject in Europe\n      could have supplied the princely magnificence which burned and\n      blazed around.\n\n      Although, as I say, the sun had arisen, yet the room was still\n      brilliantly lighted up. I judge from this circumstance, as well\n      as from an air of exhaustion in the countenance of my friend,\n      that he had not retired to bed during the whole of the preceding\n      night. In the architecture and embellishments of the chamber, the\n      evident design had been to dazzle and astound. Little attention\n      had been paid to the _decora_ of what is technically called\n      _keeping_, or to the proprieties of nationality. The eye wandered\n      from object to object, and rested upon none\u2014neither the\n      _grotesques_ of the Greek painters, nor the sculptures of the\n      best Italian days, nor the huge carvings of untutored Egypt. Rich\n      draperies in every part of the room trembled to the vibration of\n      low, melancholy music, whose origin was not to be discovered. The\n      senses were oppressed by mingled and conflicting perfumes,\n      reeking up from strange convolute censers, together with\n      multitudinous flaring and flickering tongues of emerald and\n      violet fire. The rays of the newly risen sun poured in upon the\n      whole, through windows, formed each of a single pane of\n      crimson-tinted glass. Glancing to and fro, in a thousand\n      reflections, from curtains which rolled from their cornices like\n      cataracts of molten silver, the beams of natural glory mingled at\n      length fitfully with the artificial light, and lay weltering in\n      subdued masses upon a carpet of rich, liquid-looking cloth of\n      Chili gold.\n\n      \u201cHa! ha! ha!\u2014ha! ha! ha!\u201d\u2014laughed the proprietor, motioning me to\n      a seat as I entered the room, and throwing himself back at\n      full-length upon an ottoman. \u201cI see,\u201d said he, perceiving that I\n      could not immediately reconcile myself to the _bienseance_ of so\n      singular a welcome\u2014\u201cI see you are astonished at my apartment\u2014at\n      my statues\u2014my pictures\u2014my originality of conception in\n      architecture and upholstery! absolutely drunk, eh, with my\n      magnificence? But pardon me, my dear sir, (here his tone of voice\n      dropped to the very spirit of cordiality,) pardon me for my\n      uncharitable laughter. You appeared so _utterly_ astonished.\n      Besides, some things are so completely ludicrous, that a man\n      _must_ laugh or die. To die laughing, must be the most glorious\n      of all glorious deaths! Sir Thomas More\u2014a very fine man was Sir\n      Thomas More\u2014Sir Thomas More died laughing, you remember. Also in\n      the _Absurdities_ of Ravisius Textor, there is a long list of\n      characters who came to the same magnificent end. Do you know,\n      however,\u201d continued he musingly, \u201cthat at Sparta (which is now\n      Pal\u00e6ochori,) at Sparta, I say, to the west of the citadel, among\n      a chaos of scarcely visible ruins, is a kind of _socle_, upon\n      which are still legible the letters \u039b\u0391\u039e\u039c. They are undoubtedly\n      part of \u0393\u0395\u039b\u0391\u039e\u039c\u0391. Now, at Sparta were a thousand temples and\n      shrines to a thousand different divinities. How exceedingly\n      strange that the altar of Laughter should have survived all the\n      others! But in the present instance,\u201d he resumed, with a singular\n      alteration of voice and manner, \u201cI have no right to be merry at\n      your expense. You might well have been amazed. Europe cannot\n      produce anything so fine as this, my little regal cabinet. My\n      other apartments are by no means of the same order\u2014mere _ultras_\n      of fashionable insipidity. This is better than fashion\u2014is it not?\n      Yet this has but to be seen to become the rage\u2014that is, with\n      those who could afford it at the cost of their entire patrimony.\n      I have guarded, however, against any such profanation. With one\n      exception, you are the only human being besides myself and my\n      _valet_, who has been admitted within the mysteries of these\n      imperial precincts, since they have been bedizened as you see!\u201d\n\n      I bowed in acknowledgment\u2014for the overpowering sense of splendor\n      and perfume, and music, together with the unexpected eccentricity\n      of his address and manner, prevented me from expressing, in\n      words, my appreciation of what I might have construed into a\n      compliment.\n\n      \u201cHere,\u201d he resumed, arising and leaning on my arm as he sauntered\n      around the apartment, \u201chere are paintings from the Greeks to\n      Cimabue, and from Cimabue to the present hour. Many are chosen,\n      as you see, with little deference to the opinions of Virtu. They\n      are all, however, fitting tapestry for a chamber such as this.\n      Here, too, are some _chefs d\u2019oeuvre_ of the unknown great; and\n      here, unfinished designs by men, celebrated in their day, whose\n      very names the perspicacity of the academies has left to silence\n      and to me. What think you,\u201d said he, turning abruptly as he\n      spoke\u2014\u201cwhat think you of this Madonna della Pieta?\u201d\n\n      \u201cIt is Guido\u2019s own!\u201d I said, with all the enthusiasm of my\n      nature, for I had been poring intently over its surpassing\n      loveliness. \u201cIt is Guido\u2019s own!\u2014how _could_ you have obtained\n      it?\u2014she is undoubtedly in painting what the Venus is in\n      sculpture.\u201d\n\n      \u201cHa!\u201d said he thoughtfully, \u201cthe Venus\u2014the beautiful Venus?\u2014the\n      Venus of the Medici?\u2014she of the diminutive head and the gilded\n      hair? Part of the left arm (here his voice dropped so as to be\n      heard with difficulty,) and all the right, are restorations; and\n      in the coquetry of that right arm lies, I think, the quintessence\n      of all affectation. Give _me_ the Canova! The Apollo, too, is a\n      copy\u2014there can be no doubt of it\u2014blind fool that I am, who cannot\n      behold the boasted inspiration of the Apollo! I cannot help\u2014pity\n      me!\u2014I cannot help preferring the Antinous. Was it not Socrates\n      who said that the statuary found his statue in the block of\n      marble? Then Michael Angelo was by no means original in his\n      couplet\u2014\n\n     \u2018Non ha l\u2019ottimo artista alcun concetto\n     Che un marmo solo in se non circunscriva.\u2019\u201d\n\n      It has been, or should be remarked, that, in the manner of the\n      true gentleman, we are always aware of a difference from the\n      bearing of the vulgar, without being at once precisely able to\n      determine in what such difference consists. Allowing the remark\n      to have applied in its full force to the outward demeanor of my\n      acquaintance, I felt it, on that eventful morning, still more\n      fully applicable to his moral temperament and character. Nor can\n      I better define that peculiarity of spirit which seemed to place\n      him so essentially apart from all other human beings, than by\n      calling it a _habit_ of intense and continual thought, pervading\n      even his most trivial actions\u2014intruding upon his moments of\n      dalliance\u2014and interweaving itself with his very flashes of\n      merriment\u2014like adders which writhe from out the eyes of the\n      grinning masks in the cornices around the temples of Persepolis.\n\n      I could not help, however, repeatedly observing, through the\n      mingled tone of levity and solemnity with which he rapidly\n      descanted upon matters of little importance, a certain air of\n      trepidation\u2014a degree of nervous _unction_ in action and in\n      speech\u2014an unquiet excitability of manner which appeared to me at\n      all times unaccountable, and upon some occasions even filled me\n      with alarm. Frequently, too, pausing in the middle of a sentence\n      whose commencement he had apparently forgotten, he seemed to be\n      listening in the deepest attention, as if either in momentary\n      expectation of a visitor, or to sounds which must have had\n      existence in his imagination alone.\n\n      It was during one of these reveries or pauses of apparent\n      abstraction, that, in turning over a page of the poet and scholar\n      Politian\u2019s beautiful tragedy \u201cThe Orfeo,\u201d (the first native\n      Italian tragedy,) which lay near me upon an ottoman, I discovered\n      a passage underlined in pencil. It was a passage towards the end\n      of the third act\u2014a passage of the most heart-stirring\n      excitement\u2014a passage which, although tainted with impurity, no\n      man shall read without a thrill of novel emotion\u2014no woman without\n      a sigh. The whole page was blotted with fresh tears; and, upon\n      the opposite interleaf, were the following English lines, written\n      in a hand so very different from the peculiar characters of my\n      acquaintance, that I had some difficulty in recognising it as his\n      own:\u2014\n\nThou wast that all to me, love,\n    For which my soul did pine\u2014\nA green isle in the sea, love,\n    A fountain and a shrine,\nAll wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers;\n    And all the flowers were mine.\n\nAh, dream too bright to last!\n    Ah, starry Hope, that didst arise\nBut to be overcast!\n    A voice from out the Future cries,\n\u201cOnward!\u201d\u2014but o\u2019er the Past\n    (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies,\nMute\u2014motionless\u2014aghast!\n\nFor alas!  alas!  with me\n    The light of life is o\u2019er.\n\u201cNo more\u2014no more\u2014no more,\u201d\n    (Such language holds the solemn sea\nTo the sands upon the shore,)\n    Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,\nOr the stricken eagle soar!\n\nNow all my hours are trances;\n    And all my nightly dreams\nAre where the dark eye glances,\n    And where thy footstep gleams,\nIn what ethereal dances,\n    By what Italian streams.\n\nAlas!  for that accursed time\n    They bore thee o\u2019er the billow,\nFrom Love to titled age and crime,\n    And an unholy pillow!\u2014\nFrom me, and from our misty clime,\n    Where weeps the silver willow!\n\n      That these lines were written in English\u2014a language with which I\n      had not believed their author acquainted\u2014afforded me little\n      matter for surprise. I was too well aware of the extent of his\n      acquirements, and of the singular pleasure he took in concealing\n      them from observation, to be astonished at any similar discovery;\n      but the place of date, I must confess, occasioned me no little\n      amazement. It had been originally written _London_, and\n      afterwards carefully overscored\u2014not, however, so effectually as\n      to conceal the word from a scrutinizing eye. I say, this\n      occasioned me no little amazement; for I well remember that, in a\n      former conversation with a friend, I particularly inquired if he\n      had at any time met in London the Marchesa di Mentoni, (who for\n      some years previous to her marriage had resided in that city,)\n      when his answer, if I mistake not, gave me to understand that he\n      had never visited the metropolis of Great Britain. I might as\n      well here mention, that I have more than once heard, (without, of\n      course, giving credit to a report involving so many\n      improbabilities,) that the person of whom I speak, was not only\n      by birth, but in education, an _Englishman_.\n\n\u201cThere is one painting,\u201d said he, without being aware of my notice of\nthe tragedy\u2014\u201cthere is still one painting which you have not seen.\u201d And\nthrowing aside a drapery, he discovered a full-length portrait of the\nMarchesa Aphrodite.\n\nHuman art could have done no more in the delineation of her superhuman\nbeauty. The same ethereal figure which stood before me the preceding\nnight upon the steps of the Ducal Palace, stood before me once again.\nBut in the expression of the countenance, which was beaming all over\nwith smiles, there still lurked (incomprehensible anomaly!) that fitful\nstain of melancholy which will ever be found inseparable from the\nperfection of the beautiful. Her right arm lay folded over her bosom.\nWith her left she pointed downward to a curiously fashioned vase. One\nsmall, fairy foot, alone visible, barely touched the earth; and,\nscarcely discernible in the brilliant atmosphere which seemed to\nencircle and enshrine her loveliness, floated a pair of the most\ndelicately imagined wings. My glance fell from the painting to the\nfigure of my friend, and the vigorous words of Chapman\u2019s _Bussy\nD\u2019Ambois_, quivered instinctively upon my lips:\n\n    \u201cHe is up\nThere like a Roman statue!  He will stand\nTill Death hath made him marble!\u201d\n\n      \u201cCome,\u201d he said at length, turning towards a table of richly\n      enamelled and massive silver, upon which were a few goblets\n      fantastically stained, together with two large Etruscan vases,\n      fashioned in the same extraordinary model as that in the\n      foreground of the portrait, and filled with what I supposed to be\n      Johannisberger. \u201cCome,\u201d he said, abruptly, \u201clet us drink! It is\n      early\u2014but let us drink. It is _indeed_ early,\u201d he continued,\n      musingly, as a cherub with a heavy golden hammer made the\n      apartment ring with the first hour after sunrise: \u201cIt is _indeed_\n      early\u2014but what matters it? let us drink! Let us pour out an\n      offering to yon solemn sun which these gaudy lamps and censers\n      are so eager to subdue!\u201d And, having made me pledge him in a\n      bumper, he swallowed in rapid succession several goblets of the\n      wine.\n\n      \u201cTo dream,\u201d he continued, resuming the tone of his desultory\n      conversation, as he held up to the rich light of a censer one of\n      the magnificent vases\u2014\u201cto dream has been the business of my life.\n      I have therefore framed for myself, as you see, a bower of\n      dreams. In the heart of Venice could I have erected a better? You\n      behold around you, it is true, a medley of architectural\n      embellishments. The chastity of Ionia is offended by antediluvian\n      devices, and the sphynxes of Egypt are outstretched upon carpets\n      of gold. Yet the effect is incongruous to the timid alone.\n      Proprieties of place, and especially of time, are the bugbears\n      which terrify mankind from the contemplation of the magnificent.\n      Once I was myself a decorist; but that sublimation of folly has\n      palled upon my soul. All this is now the fitter for my purpose.\n      Like these arabesque censers, my spirit is writhing in fire, and\n      the delirium of this scene is fashioning me for the wilder\n      visions of that land of real dreams whither I am now rapidly\n      departing.\u201d He here paused abruptly, bent his head to his bosom,\n      and seemed to listen to a sound which I could not hear. At\n      length, erecting his frame, he looked upwards, and ejaculated the\n      lines of the Bishop of Chichester:\n\n     _\u201cStay for me there!  I will not fail_\n     _To meet thee in that hollow vale.\u201d_\n\n      In the next instant, confessing the power of the wine, he threw\n      himself at full-length upon an ottoman.\n\n      A quick step was now heard upon the staircase, and a loud knock\n      at the door rapidly succeeded. I was hastening to anticipate a\n      second disturbance, when a page of Mentoni\u2019s household burst into\n      the room, and faltered out, in a voice choking with emotion, the\n      incoherent words, \u201cMy mistress!\u2014my mistress!\u2014Poisoned!\u2014poisoned!\n      Oh, beautiful\u2014oh, beautiful Aphrodite!\u201d\n\n      Bewildered, I flew to the ottoman, and endeavored to arouse the\n      sleeper to a sense of the startling intelligence. But his limbs\n      were rigid\u2014his lips were livid\u2014his lately beaming eyes were\n      riveted in _death_. I staggered back towards the table\u2014my hand\n      fell upon a cracked and blackened goblet\u2014and a consciousness of\n      the entire and terrible truth flashed suddenly over my soul.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PIT AND THE PENDULUM\n\n\n     Impia tortorum longos hic turba furores\n     Sanguinis innocui, non satiata, aluit.\n     Sospite nunc patria, fracto nunc funeris antro,\n     Mors ubi dira fuit vita salusque patent.\n\n[_Quatrain composed for the gates of a market to be erected upon the\nsite of the Jacobin Club House at Paris_.]\n\n      I was sick\u2014sick unto death with that long agony; and when they at\n      length unbound me, and I was permitted to sit, I felt that my\n      senses were leaving me. The sentence\u2014the dread sentence of\n      death\u2014was the last of distinct accentuation which reached my\n      ears. After that, the sound of the inquisitorial voices seemed\n      merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum. It conveyed to my soul\n      the idea of _revolution_\u2014perhaps from its association in fancy\n      with the burr of a mill wheel. This only for a brief period, for\n      presently I heard no more. Yet, for a while, I saw\u2014but with how\n      terrible an exaggeration! I saw the lips of the black-robed\n      judges. They appeared to me white\u2014whiter than the sheet upon\n      which I trace these words\u2014and thin even to grotesqueness; thin\n      with the intensity of their expression of firmness\u2014of immoveable\n      resolution\u2014of stern contempt of human torture. I saw that the\n      decrees of what to me was Fate, were still issuing from those\n      lips. I saw them writhe with a deadly locution. I saw them\n      fashion the syllables of my name; and I shuddered because no\n      sound succeeded. I saw, too, for a few moments of delirious\n      horror, the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable\n      draperies which enwrapped the walls of the apartment. And then my\n      vision fell upon the seven tall candles upon the table. At first\n      they wore the aspect of charity, and seemed white and slender\n      angels who would save me; but then, all at once, there came a\n      most deadly nausea over my spirit, and I felt every fibre in my\n      frame thrill as if I had touched the wire of a galvanic battery,\n      while the angel forms became meaningless spectres, with heads of\n      flame, and I saw that from them there would be no help. And then\n      there stole into my fancy, like a rich musical note, the thought\n      of what sweet rest there must be in the grave. The thought came\n      gently and stealthily, and it seemed long before it attained full\n      appreciation; but just as my spirit came at length properly to\n      feel and entertain it, the figures of the judges vanished, as if\n      magically, from before me; the tall candles sank into\n      nothingness; their flames went out utterly; the blackness of\n      darkness supervened; all sensations appeared swallowed up in a\n      mad rushing descent as of the soul into Hades. Then silence, and\n      stillness, night were the universe.\n\n      I had swooned; but still will not say that all of consciousness\n      was lost. What of it there remained I will not attempt to define,\n      or even to describe; yet all was not lost. In the deepest\n      slumber\u2014no! In delirium\u2014no! In a swoon\u2014no! In death\u2014no! even in\n      the grave all is not lost. Else there is no immortality for man.\n      Arousing from the most profound of slumbers, we break the\n      gossamer web of some dream. Yet in a second afterward, (so frail\n      may that web have been) we remember not that we have dreamed. In\n      the return to life from the swoon there are two stages; first,\n      that of the sense of mental or spiritual; secondly, that of the\n      sense of physical, existence. It seems probable that if, upon\n      reaching the second stage, we could recall the impressions of the\n      first, we should find these impressions eloquent in memories of\n      the gulf beyond. And that gulf is\u2014what? How at least shall we\n      distinguish its shadows from those of the tomb? But if the\n      impressions of what I have termed the first stage are not, at\n      will, recalled, yet, after long interval, do they not come\n      unbidden, while we marvel whence they come? He who has never\n      swooned, is not he who finds strange palaces and wildly familiar\n      faces in coals that glow; is not he who beholds floating in\n      mid-air the sad visions that the many may not view; is not he who\n      ponders over the perfume of some novel flower; is not he whose\n      brain grows bewildered with the meaning of some musical cadence\n      which has never before arrested his attention.\n\n      Amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember; amid earnest\n      struggles to regather some token of the state of seeming\n      nothingness into which my soul had lapsed, there have been\n      moments when I have dreamed of success; there have been brief,\n      very brief periods when I have conjured up remembrances which the\n      lucid reason of a later epoch assures me could have had reference\n      only to that condition of seeming unconsciousness. These shadows\n      of memory tell, indistinctly, of tall figures that lifted and\n      bore me in silence down\u2014down\u2014still down\u2014till a hideous dizziness\n      oppressed me at the mere idea of the interminableness of the\n      descent. They tell also of a vague horror at my heart, on account\n      of that heart\u2019s unnatural stillness. Then comes a sense of sudden\n      motionlessness throughout all things; as if those who bore me (a\n      ghastly train!) had outrun, in their descent, the limits of the\n      limitless, and paused from the wearisomeness of their toil. After\n      this I call to mind flatness and dampness; and then all is\n      madness\u2014the madness of a memory which busies itself among\n      forbidden things.\n\n      Very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and sound\u2014the\n      tumultuous motion of the heart, and, in my ears, the sound of its\n      beating. Then a pause in which all is blank. Then again sound,\n      and motion, and touch\u2014a tingling sensation pervading my frame.\n      Then the mere consciousness of existence, without thought\u2014a\n      condition which lasted long. Then, very suddenly, thought, and\n      shuddering terror, and earnest endeavor to comprehend my true\n      state. Then a strong desire to lapse into insensibility. Then a\n      rushing revival of soul and a successful effort to move. And now\n      a full memory of the trial, of the judges, of the sable\n      draperies, of the sentence, of the sickness, of the swoon. Then\n      entire forgetfulness of all that followed; of all that a later\n      day and much earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely to\n      recall.\n\n      So far, I had not opened my eyes. I felt that I lay upon my back,\n      unbound. I reached out my hand, and it fell heavily upon\n      something damp and hard. There I suffered it to remain for many\n      minutes, while I strove to imagine where and what I could be. I\n      longed, yet dared not to employ my vision. I dreaded the first\n      glance at objects around me. It was not that I feared to look\n      upon things horrible, but that I grew aghast lest there should be\n      nothing to see. At length, with a wild desperation at heart, I\n      quickly unclosed my eyes. My worst thoughts, then, were\n      confirmed. The blackness of eternal night encompassed me. I\n      struggled for breath. The intensity of the darkness seemed to\n      oppress and stifle me. The atmosphere was intolerably close. I\n      still lay quietly, and made effort to exercise my reason. I\n      brought to mind the inquisitorial proceedings, and attempted from\n      that point to deduce my real condition. The sentence had passed;\n      and it appeared to me that a very long interval of time had since\n      elapsed. Yet not for a moment did I suppose myself actually dead.\n      Such a supposition, notwithstanding what we read in fiction, is\n      altogether inconsistent with real existence;\u2014but where and in\n      what state was I? The condemned to death, I knew, perished\n      usually at the autos-da-fe, and one of these had been held on the\n      very night of the day of my trial. Had I been remanded to my\n      dungeon, to await the next sacrifice, which would not take place\n      for many months? This I at once saw could not be. Victims had\n      been in immediate demand. Moreover, my dungeon, as well as all\n      the condemned cells at Toledo, had stone floors, and light was\n      not altogether excluded.\n\n      A fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my\n      heart, and for a brief period, I once more relapsed into\n      insensibility. Upon recovering, I at once started to my feet,\n      trembling convulsively in every fibre. I thrust my arms wildly\n      above and around me in all directions. I felt nothing; yet\n      dreaded to move a step, lest I should be impeded by the walls of\n      a tomb. Perspiration burst from every pore, and stood in cold big\n      beads upon my forehead. The agony of suspense grew at length\n      intolerable, and I cautiously moved forward, with my arms\n      extended, and my eyes straining from their sockets, in the hope\n      of catching some faint ray of light. I proceeded for many paces;\n      but still all was blackness and vacancy. I breathed more freely.\n      It seemed evident that mine was not, at least, the most hideous\n      of fates.\n\n      And now, as I still continued to step cautiously onward, there\n      came thronging upon my recollection a thousand vague rumors of\n      the horrors of Toledo. Of the dungeons there had been strange\n      things narrated\u2014fables I had always deemed them\u2014but yet strange,\n      and too ghastly to repeat, save in a whisper. Was I left to\n      perish of starvation in this subterranean world of darkness; or\n      what fate, perhaps even more fearful, awaited me? That the result\n      would be death, and a death of more than customary bitterness, I\n      knew too well the character of my judges to doubt. The mode and\n      the hour were all that occupied or distracted me.\n\n      My outstretched hands at length encountered some solid\n      obstruction. It was a wall, seemingly of stone masonry\u2014very\n      smooth, slimy, and cold. I followed it up; stepping with all the\n      careful distrust with which certain antique narratives had\n      inspired me. This process, however, afforded me no means of\n      ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon; as I might make its\n      circuit, and return to the point whence I set out, without being\n      aware of the fact; so perfectly uniform seemed the wall. I\n      therefore sought the knife which had been in my pocket, when led\n      into the inquisitorial chamber; but it was gone; my clothes had\n      been exchanged for a wrapper of coarse serge. I had thought of\n      forcing the blade in some minute crevice of the masonry, so as to\n      identify my point of departure. The difficulty, nevertheless, was\n      but trivial; although, in the disorder of my fancy, it seemed at\n      first insuperable. I tore a part of the hem from the robe and\n      placed the fragment at full length, and at right angles to the\n      wall. In groping my way around the prison, I could not fail to\n      encounter this rag upon completing the circuit. So, at least I\n      thought: but I had not counted upon the extent of the dungeon, or\n      upon my own weakness. The ground was moist and slippery. I\n      staggered onward for some time, when I stumbled and fell. My\n      excessive fatigue induced me to remain prostrate; and sleep soon\n      overtook me as I lay.\n\n      Upon awaking, and stretching forth an arm, I found beside me a\n      loaf and a pitcher with water. I was too much exhausted to\n      reflect upon this circumstance, but ate and drank with avidity.\n      Shortly afterward, I resumed my tour around the prison, and with\n      much toil came at last upon the fragment of the serge. Up to the\n      period when I fell I had counted fifty-two paces, and upon\n      resuming my walk, I had counted forty-eight more\u2014when I arrived\n      at the rag. There were in all, then, a hundred paces; and,\n      admitting two paces to the yard, I presumed the dungeon to be\n      fifty yards in circuit. I had met, however, with many angles in\n      the wall, and thus I could form no guess at the shape of the\n      vault, for vault I could not help supposing it to be.\n\n      I had little object\u2014certainly no hope\u2014in these researches; but a\n      vague curiosity prompted me to continue them. Quitting the wall,\n      I resolved to cross the area of the enclosure. At first I\n      proceeded with extreme caution, for the floor, although seemingly\n      of solid material, was treacherous with slime. At length,\n      however, I took courage, and did not hesitate to step firmly;\n      endeavoring to cross in as direct a line as possible. I had\n      advanced some ten or twelve paces in this manner, when the\n      remnant of the torn hem of my robe became entangled between my\n      legs. I stepped on it, and fell violently on my face.\n\n      In the confusion attending my fall, I did not immediately\n      apprehend a somewhat startling circumstance, which yet, in a few\n      seconds afterward, and while I still lay prostrate, arrested my\n      attention. It was this: my chin rested upon the floor of the\n      prison, but my lips and the upper portion of my head, although\n      seemingly at a less elevation than the chin, touched nothing. At\n      the same time my forehead seemed bathed in a clammy vapor, and\n      the peculiar smell of decayed fungus arose to my nostrils. I put\n      forward my arm, and shuddered to find that I had fallen at the\n      very brink of a circular pit, whose extent, of course, I had no\n      means of ascertaining at the moment. Groping about the masonry\n      just below the margin, I succeeded in dislodging a small\n      fragment, and let it fall into the abyss. For many seconds I\n      hearkened to its reverberations as it dashed against the sides of\n      the chasm in its descent; at length there was a sullen plunge\n      into water, succeeded by loud echoes. At the same moment there\n      came a sound resembling the quick opening, and as rapid closing\n      of a door overhead, while a faint gleam of light flashed suddenly\n      through the gloom, and as suddenly faded away.\n\n      I saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me, and\n      congratulated myself upon the timely accident by which I had\n      escaped. Another step before my fall, and the world had seen me\n      no more. And the death just avoided, was of that very character\n      which I had regarded as fabulous and frivolous in the tales\n      respecting the Inquisition. To the victims of its tyranny, there\n      was the choice of death with its direst physical agonies, or\n      death with its most hideous moral horrors. I had been reserved\n      for the latter. By long suffering my nerves had been unstrung,\n      until I trembled at the sound of my own voice, and had become in\n      every respect a fitting subject for the species of torture which\n      awaited me.\n\n      Shaking in every limb, I groped my way back to the wall\u2014resolving\n      there to perish rather than risk the terrors of the wells, of\n      which my imagination now pictured many in various positions about\n      the dungeon. In other conditions of mind I might have had courage\n      to end my misery at once by a plunge into one of these abysses;\n      but now I was the veriest of cowards. Neither could I forget what\n      I had read of these pits\u2014that the sudden extinction of life\n      formed no part of their most horrible plan.\n\n      Agitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours, but at\n      length I again slumbered. Upon arousing, I found by my side, as\n      before, a loaf and a pitcher of water. A burning thirst consumed\n      me, and I emptied the vessel at a draught. It must have been\n      drugged\u2014for scarcely had I drunk, before I became irresistibly\n      drowsy. A deep sleep fell upon me\u2014a sleep like that of death. How\n      long it lasted of course, I know not; but when, once again, I\n      unclosed my eyes, the objects around me were visible. By a wild\n      sulphurous lustre, the origin of which I could not at first\n      determine, I was enabled to see the extent and aspect of the\n      prison.\n\n      In its size I had been greatly mistaken. The whole circuit of its\n      walls did not exceed twenty-five yards. For some minutes this\n      fact occasioned me a world of vain trouble; vain indeed! for what\n      could be of less importance, under the terrible circumstances\n      which environed me, then the mere dimensions of my dungeon? But\n      my soul took a wild interest in trifles, and I busied myself in\n      endeavors to account for the error I had committed in my\n      measurement. The truth at length flashed upon me. In my first\n      attempt at exploration I had counted fifty-two paces, up to the\n      period when I fell; I must then have been within a pace or two of\n      the fragment of serge; in fact, I had nearly performed the\n      circuit of the vault. I then slept\u2014and, upon awaking, I must have\n      returned upon my steps\u2014thus supposing the circuit nearly double\n      what it actually was. My confusion of mind prevented me from\n      observing that I began my tour with the wall to the left, and\n      ended it with the wall to the right.\n\n      I had been deceived, too, in respect to the shape of the\n      enclosure. In feeling my way I had found many angles, and thus\n      deduced an idea of great irregularity; so potent is the effect of\n      total darkness upon one arousing from lethargy or sleep! The\n      angles were simply those of a few slight depressions, or niches,\n      at odd intervals. The general shape of the prison was square.\n      What I had taken for masonry seemed now to be iron, or some other\n      metal, in huge plates, whose sutures or joints occasioned the\n      depression. The entire surface of this metallic enclosure was\n      rudely daubed in all the hideous and repulsive devices to which\n      the charnel superstition of the monks has given rise. The figures\n      of fiends in aspects of menace, with skeleton forms, and other\n      more really fearful images, overspread and disfigured the walls.\n      I observed that the outlines of these monstrosities were\n      sufficiently distinct, but that the colors seemed faded and\n      blurred, as if from the effects of a damp atmosphere. I now\n      noticed the floor, too, which was of stone. In the centre yawned\n      the circular pit from whose jaws I had escaped; but it was the\n      only one in the dungeon.\n\n      All this I saw indistinctly and by much effort\u2014for my personal\n      condition had been greatly changed during slumber. I now lay upon\n      my back, and at full length, on a species of low framework of\n      wood. To this I was securely bound by a long strap resembling a\n      surcingle. It passed in many convolutions about my limbs and\n      body, leaving at liberty only my head, and my left arm to such\n      extent that I could, by dint of much exertion, supply myself with\n      food from an earthen dish which lay by my side on the floor. I\n      saw, to my horror, that the pitcher had been removed. I say to my\n      horror\u2014for I was consumed with intolerable thirst. This thirst it\n      appeared to be the design of my persecutors to stimulate\u2014for the\n      food in the dish was meat pungently seasoned.\n\n      Looking upward, I surveyed the ceiling of my prison. It was some\n      thirty or forty feet overhead, and constructed much as the side\n      walls. In one of its panels a very singular figure riveted my\n      whole attention. It was the painted figure of Time as he is\n      commonly represented, save that, in lieu of a scythe, he held\n      what, at a casual glance, I supposed to be the pictured image of\n      a huge pendulum such as we see on antique clocks. There was\n      something, however, in the appearance of this machine which\n      caused me to regard it more attentively. While I gazed directly\n      upward at it (for its position was immediately over my own) I\n      fancied that I saw it in motion. In an instant afterward the\n      fancy was confirmed. Its sweep was brief, and of course slow. I\n      watched it for some minutes, somewhat in fear, but more in\n      wonder. Wearied at length with observing its dull movement, I\n      turned my eyes upon the other objects in the cell.\n\n      A slight noise attracted my notice, and, looking to the floor, I\n      saw several enormous rats traversing it. They had issued from the\n      well, which lay just within view to my right. Even then, while I\n      gazed, they came up in troops, hurriedly, with ravenous eyes,\n      allured by the scent of the meat. From this it required much\n      effort and attention to scare them away.\n\n      It might have been half an hour, perhaps even an hour, (for I\n      could take but imperfect note of time) before I again cast my\n      eyes upward. What I then saw confounded and amazed me. The sweep\n      of the pendulum had increased in extent by nearly a yard. As a\n      natural consequence, its velocity was also much greater. But what\n      mainly disturbed me was the idea that had perceptibly descended.\n      I now observed\u2014with what horror it is needless to say\u2014that its\n      nether extremity was formed of a crescent of glittering steel,\n      about a foot in length from horn to horn; the horns upward, and\n      the under edge evidently as keen as that of a razor. Like a razor\n      also, it seemed massy and heavy, tapering from the edge into a\n      solid and broad structure above. It was appended to a weighty rod\n      of brass, and the whole hissed as it swung through the air.\n\n      I could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by monkish\n      ingenuity in torture. My cognizance of the pit had become known\n      to the inquisitorial agents\u2014_the pit_, whose horrors had been\n      destined for so bold a recusant as myself\u2014the pit, typical of\n      hell, and regarded by rumor as the Ultima Thule of all their\n      punishments. The plunge into this pit I had avoided by the merest\n      of accidents, I knew that surprise, or entrapment into torment,\n      formed an important portion of all the grotesquerie of these\n      dungeon deaths. Having failed to fall, it was no part of the\n      demon plan to hurl me into the abyss; and thus (there being no\n      alternative) a different and a milder destruction awaited me.\n      Milder! I half smiled in my agony as I thought of such\n      application of such a term.\n\n      What boots it to tell of the long, long hours of horror more than\n      mortal, during which I counted the rushing vibrations of the\n      steel! Inch by inch\u2014line by line\u2014with a descent only appreciable\n      at intervals that seemed ages\u2014down and still down it came! Days\n      passed\u2014it might have been that many days passed\u2014ere it swept so\n      closely over me as to fan me with its acrid breath. The odor of\n      the sharp steel forced itself into my nostrils. I prayed\u2014I\n      wearied heaven with my prayer for its more speedy descent. I grew\n      frantically mad, and struggled to force myself upward against the\n      sweep of the fearful scimitar. And then I fell suddenly calm, and\n      lay smiling at the glittering death, as a child at some rare\n      bauble.\n\n      There was another interval of utter insensibility; it was brief;\n      for, upon again lapsing into life there had been no perceptible\n      descent in the pendulum. But it might have been long; for I knew\n      there were demons who took note of my swoon, and who could have\n      arrested the vibration at pleasure. Upon my recovery, too, I felt\n      very\u2014oh! inexpressibly\u2014sick and weak, as if through long\n      inanition. Even amid the agonies of that period, the human nature\n      craved food. With painful effort I outstretched my left arm as\n      far as my bonds permitted, and took possession of the small\n      remnant which had been spared me by the rats. As I put a portion\n      of it within my lips, there rushed to my mind a half formed\n      thought of joy\u2014of hope. Yet what business had _I_ with hope? It\n      was, as I say, a half formed thought\u2014man has many such, which are\n      never completed. I felt that it was of joy\u2014of hope; but felt also\n      that it had perished in its formation. In vain I struggled to\n      perfect\u2014to regain it. Long suffering had nearly annihilated all\n      my ordinary powers of mind. I was an imbecile\u2014an idiot.\n\n      The vibration of the pendulum was at right angles to my length. I\n      saw that the crescent was designed to cross the region of the\n      heart. It would fray the serge of my robe\u2014it would return and\n      repeat its operations\u2014again\u2014and again. Notwithstanding its\n      terrifically wide sweep (some thirty feet or more) and the\n      hissing vigor of its descent, sufficient to sunder these very\n      walls of iron, still the fraying of my robe would be all that,\n      for several minutes, it would accomplish. And at this thought I\n      paused. I dared not go farther than this reflection. I dwelt upon\n      it with a pertinacity of attention\u2014as if, in so dwelling, I could\n      arrest here the descent of the steel. I forced myself to ponder\n      upon the sound of the crescent as it should pass across the\n      garment\u2014upon the peculiar thrilling sensation which the friction\n      of cloth produces on the nerves. I pondered upon all this\n      frivolity until my teeth were on edge.\n\n      Down\u2014steadily down it crept. I took a frenzied pleasure in\n      contrasting its downward with its lateral velocity. To the\n      right\u2014to the left\u2014far and wide\u2014with the shriek of a damned\n      spirit! to my heart with the stealthy pace of the tiger! I\n      alternately laughed and howled as the one or the other idea grew\n      predominant.\n\n      Down\u2014certainly, relentlessly down! It vibrated within three\n      inches of my bosom! I struggled violently, furiously, to free my\n      left arm. This was free only from the elbow to the hand. I could\n      reach the latter, from the platter beside me, to my mouth, with\n      great effort, but no farther. Could I have broken the fastenings\n      above the elbow, I would have seized and attempted to arrest the\n      pendulum. I might as well have attempted to arrest an avalanche!\n\n      Down\u2014still unceasingly\u2014still inevitably down! I gasped and\n      struggled at each vibration. I shrunk convulsively at its every\n      sweep. My eyes followed its outward or upward whirls with the\n      eagerness of the most unmeaning despair; they closed themselves\n      spasmodically at the descent, although death would have been a\n      relief, oh, how unspeakable! Still I quivered in every nerve to\n      think how slight a sinking of the machinery would precipitate\n      that keen, glistening axe upon my bosom. It was hope that\n      prompted the nerve to quiver\u2014the frame to shrink. It was hope\u2014the\n      hope that triumphs on the rack\u2014that whispers to the\n      death-condemned even in the dungeons of the Inquisition.\n\n      I saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel in\n      actual contact with my robe, and with this observation there\n      suddenly came over my spirit all the keen, collected calmness of\n      despair. For the first time during many hours\u2014or perhaps days\u2014I\n      thought. It now occurred to me that the bandage, or surcingle,\n      which enveloped me, was unique. I was tied by no separate cord.\n      The first stroke of the razorlike crescent athwart any portion of\n      the band, would so detach it that it might be unwound from my\n      person by means of my left hand. But how fearful, in that case,\n      the proximity of the steel! The result of the slightest struggle\n      how deadly! Was it likely, moreover, that the minions of the\n      torturer had not foreseen and provided for this possibility? Was\n      it probable that the bandage crossed my bosom in the track of the\n      pendulum? Dreading to find my faint, and, as it seemed, my last\n      hope frustrated, I so far elevated my head as to obtain a\n      distinct view of my breast. The surcingle enveloped my limbs and\n      body close in all directions\u2014save in the path of the destroying\n      crescent.\n\n      Scarcely had I dropped my head back into its original position,\n      when there flashed upon my mind what I cannot better describe\n      than as the unformed half of that idea of deliverance to which I\n      have previously alluded, and of which a moiety only floated\n      indeterminately through my brain when I raised food to my burning\n      lips. The whole thought was now present\u2014feeble, scarcely sane,\n      scarcely definite,\u2014but still entire. I proceeded at once, with\n      the nervous energy of despair, to attempt its execution.\n\n      For many hours the immediate vicinity of the low framework upon\n      which I lay had been literally swarming with rats. They were\n      wild, bold, ravenous\u2014their red eyes glaring upon me as if they\n      waited but for motionlessness on my part to make me their prey.\n      \u201cTo what food,\u201d I thought, \u201chave they been accustomed in the\n      well?\u201d\n\n      They had devoured, in spite of all my efforts to prevent them,\n      all but a small remnant of the contents of the dish. I had fallen\n      into an habitual see-saw, or wave of the hand about the platter;\n      and, at length, the unconscious uniformity of the movement\n      deprived it of effect. In their voracity the vermin frequently\n      fastened their sharp fangs in my fingers. With the particles of\n      the oily and spicy viand which now remained, I thoroughly rubbed\n      the bandage wherever I could reach it; then, raising my hand from\n      the floor, I lay breathlessly still.\n\n      At first the ravenous animals were startled and terrified at the\n      change\u2014at the cessation of movement. They shrank alarmedly back;\n      many sought the well. But this was only for a moment. I had not\n      counted in vain upon their voracity. Observing that I remained\n      without motion, one or two of the boldest leaped upon the\n      frame-work, and smelt at the surcingle. This seemed the signal\n      for a general rush. Forth from the well they hurried in fresh\n      troops. They clung to the wood\u2014they overran it, and leaped in\n      hundreds upon my person. The measured movement of the pendulum\n      disturbed them not at all. Avoiding its strokes they busied\n      themselves with the anointed bandage. They pressed\u2014they swarmed\n      upon me in ever accumulating heaps. They writhed upon my throat;\n      their cold lips sought my own; I was half stifled by their\n      thronging pressure; disgust, for which the world has no name,\n      swelled my bosom, and chilled, with a heavy clamminess, my heart.\n      Yet one minute, and I felt that the struggle would be over.\n      Plainly I perceived the loosening of the bandage. I knew that in\n      more than one place it must be already severed. With a more than\n      human resolution I lay still.\n\n      Nor had I erred in my calculations\u2014nor had I endured in vain. I\n      at length felt that I was free. The surcingle hung in ribands\n      from my body. But the stroke of the pendulum already pressed upon\n      my bosom. It had divided the serge of the robe. It had cut\n      through the linen beneath. Twice again it swung, and a sharp\n      sense of pain shot through every nerve. But the moment of escape\n      had arrived. At a wave of my hand my deliverers hurried\n      tumultuously away. With a steady movement\u2014cautious, sidelong,\n      shrinking, and slow\u2014I slid from the embrace of the bandage and\n      beyond the reach of the scimitar. For the moment, at least, I was\n      free.\n\n      Free!\u2014and in the grasp of the Inquisition! I had scarcely stepped\n      from my wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison,\n      when the motion of the hellish machine ceased and I beheld it\n      drawn up, by some invisible force, through the ceiling. This was\n      a lesson which I took desperately to heart. My every motion was\n      undoubtedly watched. Free!\u2014I had but escaped death in one form of\n      agony, to be delivered unto worse than death in some other. With\n      that thought I rolled my eves nervously around on the barriers of\n      iron that hemmed me in. Something unusual\u2014some change which, at\n      first, I could not appreciate distinctly\u2014it was obvious, had\n      taken place in the apartment. For many minutes of a dreamy and\n      trembling abstraction, I busied myself in vain, unconnected\n      conjecture. During this period, I became aware, for the first\n      time, of the origin of the sulphurous light which illumined the\n      cell. It proceeded from a fissure, about half an inch in width,\n      extending entirely around the prison at the base of the walls,\n      which thus appeared, and were, completely separated from the\n      floor. I endeavored, but of course in vain, to look through the\n      aperture.\n\n      As I arose from the attempt, the mystery of the alteration in the\n      chamber broke at once upon my understanding. I have observed\n      that, although the outlines of the figures upon the walls were\n      sufficiently distinct, yet the colors seemed blurred and\n      indefinite. These colors had now assumed, and were momentarily\n      assuming, a startling and most intense brilliancy, that gave to\n      the spectral and fiendish portraitures an aspect that might have\n      thrilled even firmer nerves than my own. Demon eyes, of a wild\n      and ghastly vivacity, glared upon me in a thousand directions,\n      where none had been visible before, and gleamed with the lurid\n      lustre of a fire that I could not force my imagination to regard\n      as unreal.\n\n      _Unreal!_\u2014Even while I breathed there came to my nostrils the\n      breath of the vapour of heated iron! A suffocating odour pervaded\n      the prison! A deeper glow settled each moment in the eyes that\n      glared at my agonies! A richer tint of crimson diffused itself\n      over the pictured horrors of blood. I panted! I gasped for\n      breath! There could be no doubt of the design of my\n      tormentors\u2014oh! most unrelenting! oh! most demoniac of men! I\n      shrank from the glowing metal to the centre of the cell. Amid the\n      thought of the fiery destruction that impended, the idea of the\n      coolness of the well came over my soul like balm. I rushed to its\n      deadly brink. I threw my straining vision below. The glare from\n      the enkindled roof illumined its inmost recesses. Yet, for a wild\n      moment, did my spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what I\n      saw. At length it forced\u2014it wrestled its way into my soul\u2014it\n      burned itself in upon my shuddering reason. Oh! for a voice to\n      speak!\u2014oh! horror!\u2014oh! any horror but this! With a shriek, I\n      rushed from the margin, and buried my face in my hands\u2014weeping\n      bitterly.\n\n      The heat rapidly increased, and once again I looked up,\n      shuddering as with a fit of the ague. There had been a second\n      change in the cell\u2014and now the change was obviously in the form.\n      As before, it was in vain that I, at first, endeavoured to\n      appreciate or understand what was taking place. But not long was\n      I left in doubt. The Inquisitorial vengeance had been hurried by\n      my two-fold escape, and there was to be no more dallying with the\n      King of Terrors. The room had been square. I saw that two of its\n      iron angles were now acute\u2014two, consequently, obtuse. The fearful\n      difference quickly increased with a low rumbling or moaning\n      sound. In an instant the apartment had shifted its form into that\n      of a lozenge. But the alteration stopped not here\u2014I neither hoped\n      nor desired it to stop. I could have clasped the red walls to my\n      bosom as a garment of eternal peace. \u201cDeath,\u201d I said, \u201cany death\n      but that of the pit!\u201d Fool! might I have not known that into the\n      pit it was the object of the burning iron to urge me? Could I\n      resist its glow? or, if even that, could I withstand its\n      pressure? And now, flatter and flatter grew the lozenge, with a\n      rapidity that left me no time for contemplation. Its centre, and\n      of course, its greatest width, came just over the yawning gulf. I\n      shrank back\u2014but the closing walls pressed me resistlessly onward.\n      At length for my seared and writhing body there was no longer an\n      inch of foothold on the firm floor of the prison. I struggled no\n      more, but the agony of my soul found vent in one loud, long, and\n      final scream of despair. I felt that I tottered upon the brink\u2014I\n      averted my eyes\u2014\n\n      There was a discordant hum of human voices! There was a loud\n      blast as of many trumpets! There was a harsh grating as of a\n      thousand thunders! The fiery walls rushed back! An outstretched\n      arm caught my own as I fell, fainting, into the abyss. It was\n      that of General Lasalle. The French army had entered Toledo. The\n      Inquisition was in the hands of its enemies.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PREMATURE BURIAL\n\n\n      There are certain themes of which the interest is all-absorbing,\n      but which are too entirely horrible for the purposes of\n      legitimate fiction. These the mere romanticist must eschew, if he\n      do not wish to offend or to disgust. They are with propriety\n      handled only when the severity and majesty of Truth sanctify and\n      sustain them. We thrill, for example, with the most intense of\n      \u201cpleasurable pain\u201d over the accounts of the Passage of the\n      Beresina, of the Earthquake at Lisbon, of the Plague at London,\n      of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, or of the stifling of the\n      hundred and twenty-three prisoners in the Black Hole at Calcutta.\n      But in these accounts it is the fact\u2014\u2014it is the reality\u2014\u2014it is\n      the history which excites. As inventions, we should regard them\n      with simple abhorrence.\n\n      I have mentioned some few of the more prominent and august\n      calamities on record; but in these it is the extent, not less\n      than the character of the calamity, which so vividly impresses\n      the fancy. I need not remind the reader that, from the long and\n      weird catalogue of human miseries, I might have selected many\n      individual instances more replete with essential suffering than\n      any of these vast generalities of disaster. The true\n      wretchedness, indeed\u2014the ultimate woe\u2014\u2014is particular, not\n      diffuse. That the ghastly extremes of agony are endured by man\n      the unit, and never by man the mass\u2014\u2014for this let us thank a\n      merciful God!\n\n      To be buried while alive is, beyond question, the most terrific\n      of these extremes which has ever fallen to the lot of mere\n      mortality. That it has frequently, very frequently, so fallen\n      will scarcely be denied by those who think. The boundaries which\n      divide Life from Death are at best shadowy and vague. Who shall\n      say where the one ends, and where the other begins? We know that\n      there are diseases in which occur total cessations of all the\n      apparent functions of vitality, and yet in which these cessations\n      are merely suspensions, properly so called. They are only\n      temporary pauses in the incomprehensible mechanism. A certain\n      period elapses, and some unseen mysterious principle again sets\n      in motion the magic pinions and the wizard wheels. The silver\n      cord was not for ever loosed, nor the golden bowl irreparably\n      broken. But where, meantime, was the soul?\n\n      Apart, however, from the inevitable conclusion, _a priori_ that\n      such causes must produce such effects\u2014\u2014that the well-known\n      occurrence of such cases of suspended animation must naturally\n      give rise, now and then, to premature interments\u2014apart from this\n      consideration, we have the direct testimony of medical and\n      ordinary experience to prove that a vast number of such\n      interments have actually taken place. I might refer at once, if\n      necessary, to a hundred well-authenticated instances. One of very\n      remarkable character, and of which the circumstances may be fresh\n      in the memory of some of my readers, occurred, not very long ago,\n      in the neighboring city of Baltimore, where it occasioned a\n      painful, intense, and widely-extended excitement. The wife of one\n      of the most respectable citizens\u2014a lawyer of eminence and a\n      member of Congress\u2014was seized with a sudden and unaccountable\n      illness, which completely baffled the skill of her physicians.\n      After much suffering she died, or was supposed to die. No one\n      suspected, indeed, or had reason to suspect, that she was not\n      actually dead. She presented all the ordinary appearances of\n      death. The face assumed the usual pinched and sunken outline. The\n      lips were of the usual marble pallor. The eyes were lustreless.\n      There was no warmth. Pulsation had ceased. For three days the\n      body was preserved unburied, during which it had acquired a stony\n      rigidity. The funeral, in short, was hastened, on account of the\n      rapid advance of what was supposed to be decomposition.\n\n      The lady was deposited in her family vault, which, for three\n      subsequent years, was undisturbed. At the expiration of this term\n      it was opened for the reception of a sarcophagus; but, alas! how\n      fearful a shock awaited the husband, who, personally, threw open\n      the door! As its portals swung outwardly back, some\n      white-apparelled object fell rattling within his arms. It was the\n      skeleton of his wife in her yet unmoulded shroud.\n\n      A careful investigation rendered it evident that she had revived\n      within two days after her entombment; that her struggles within\n      the coffin had caused it to fall from a ledge, or shelf to the\n      floor, where it was so broken as to permit her escape. A lamp\n      which had been accidentally left, full of oil, within the tomb,\n      was found empty; it might have been exhausted, however, by\n      evaporation. On the uttermost of the steps which led down into\n      the dread chamber was a large fragment of the coffin, with which,\n      it seemed, that she had endeavored to arrest attention by\n      striking the iron door. While thus occupied, she probably\n      swooned, or possibly died, through sheer terror; and, in failing,\n      her shroud became entangled in some iron-work which projected\n      interiorly. Thus she remained, and thus she rotted, erect.\n\n      In the year 1810, a case of living inhumation happened in France,\n      attended with circumstances which go far to warrant the assertion\n      that truth is, indeed, stranger than fiction. The heroine of the\n      story was a Mademoiselle Victorine Lafourcade, a young girl of\n      illustrious family, of wealth, and of great personal beauty.\n      Among her numerous suitors was Julien Bossuet, a poor\n      _litterateur_, or journalist of Paris. His talents and general\n      amiability had recommended him to the notice of the heiress, by\n      whom he seems to have been truly beloved; but her pride of birth\n      decided her, finally, to reject him, and to wed a Monsieur\n      Renelle, a banker and a diplomatist of some eminence. After\n      marriage, however, this gentleman neglected, and, perhaps, even\n      more positively ill-treated her. Having passed with him some\n      wretched years, she died\u2014at least her condition so closely\n      resembled death as to deceive every one who saw her. She was\n      buried\u2014\u2014not in a vault, but in an ordinary grave in the village\n      of her nativity. Filled with despair, and still inflamed by the\n      memory of a profound attachment, the lover journeys from the\n      capital to the remote province in which the village lies, with\n      the romantic purpose of disinterring the corpse, and possessing\n      himself of its luxuriant tresses. He reaches the grave. At\n      midnight he unearths the coffin, opens it, and is in the act of\n      detaching the hair, when he is arrested by the unclosing of the\n      beloved eyes. In fact, the lady had been buried alive. Vitality\n      had not altogether departed, and she was aroused by the caresses\n      of her lover from the lethargy which had been mistaken for death.\n      He bore her frantically to his lodgings in the village. He\n      employed certain powerful restoratives suggested by no little\n      medical learning. In fine, she revived. She recognized her\n      preserver. She remained with him until, by slow degrees, she\n      fully recovered her original health. Her woman\u2019s heart was not\n      adamant, and this last lesson of love sufficed to soften it. She\n      bestowed it upon Bossuet. She returned no more to her husband,\n      but, concealing from him her resurrection, fled with her lover to\n      America. Twenty years afterward, the two returned to France, in\n      the persuasion that time had so greatly altered the lady\u2019s\n      appearance that her friends would be unable to recognize her.\n      They were mistaken, however, for, at the first meeting, Monsieur\n      Renelle did actually recognize and make claim to his wife. This\n      claim she resisted, and a judicial tribunal sustained her in her\n      resistance, deciding that the peculiar circumstances, with the\n      long lapse of years, had extinguished, not only equitably, but\n      legally, the authority of the husband.\n\n      The \u201cChirurgical Journal\u201d of Leipsic, a periodical of high\n      authority and merit, which some American bookseller would do well\n      to translate and republish, records in a late number a very\n      distressing event of the character in question.\n\n      An officer of artillery, a man of gigantic stature and of robust\n      health, being thrown from an unmanageable horse, received a very\n      severe contusion upon the head, which rendered him insensible at\n      once; the skull was slightly fractured, but no immediate danger\n      was apprehended. Trepanning was accomplished successfully. He was\n      bled, and many other of the ordinary means of relief were\n      adopted. Gradually, however, he fell into a more and more\n      hopeless state of stupor, and, finally, it was thought that he\n      died.\n\n      The weather was warm, and he was buried with indecent haste in\n      one of the public cemeteries. His funeral took place on Thursday.\n      On the Sunday following, the grounds of the cemetery were, as\n      usual, much thronged with visitors, and about noon an intense\n      excitement was created by the declaration of a peasant that,\n      while sitting upon the grave of the officer, he had distinctly\n      felt a commotion of the earth, as if occasioned by some one\n      struggling beneath. At first little attention was paid to the\n      man\u2019s asseveration; but his evident terror, and the dogged\n      obstinacy with which he persisted in his story, had at length\n      their natural effect upon the crowd. Spades were hurriedly\n      procured, and the grave, which was shamefully shallow, was in a\n      few minutes so far thrown open that the head of its occupant\n      appeared. He was then seemingly dead; but he sat nearly erect\n      within his coffin, the lid of which, in his furious struggles, he\n      had partially uplifted.\n\n      He was forthwith conveyed to the nearest hospital, and there\n      pronounced to be still living, although in an asphytic condition.\n      After some hours he revived, recognized individuals of his\n      acquaintance, and, in broken sentences spoke of his agonies in\n      the grave.\n\n      From what he related, it was clear that he must have been\n      conscious of life for more than an hour, while inhumed, before\n      lapsing into insensibility. The grave was carelessly and loosely\n      filled with an exceedingly porous soil; and thus some air was\n      necessarily admitted. He heard the footsteps of the crowd\n      overhead, and endeavored to make himself heard in turn. It was\n      the tumult within the grounds of the cemetery, he said, which\n      appeared to awaken him from a deep sleep, but no sooner was he\n      awake than he became fully aware of the awful horrors of his\n      position.\n\n      This patient, it is recorded, was doing well and seemed to be in\n      a fair way of ultimate recovery, but fell a victim to the\n      quackeries of medical experiment. The galvanic battery was\n      applied, and he suddenly expired in one of those ecstatic\n      paroxysms which, occasionally, it superinduces.\n\n      The mention of the galvanic battery, nevertheless, recalls to my\n      memory a well known and very extraordinary case in point, where\n      its action proved the means of restoring to animation a young\n      attorney of London, who had been interred for two days. This\n      occurred in 1831, and created, at the time, a very profound\n      sensation wherever it was made the subject of converse.\n\n      The patient, Mr. Edward Stapleton, had died, apparently of typhus\n      fever, accompanied with some anomalous symptoms which had excited\n      the curiosity of his medical attendants. Upon his seeming\n      decease, his friends were requested to sanction a post-mortem\n      examination, but declined to permit it. As often happens, when\n      such refusals are made, the practitioners resolved to disinter\n      the body and dissect it at leisure, in private. Arrangements were\n      easily effected with some of the numerous corps of\n      body-snatchers, with which London abounds; and, upon the third\n      night after the funeral, the supposed corpse was unearthed from a\n      grave eight feet deep, and deposited in the opening chamber of\n      one of the private hospitals.\n\n      An incision of some extent had been actually made in the abdomen,\n      when the fresh and undecayed appearance of the subject suggested\n      an application of the battery. One experiment succeeded another,\n      and the customary effects supervened, with nothing to\n      characterize them in any respect, except, upon one or two\n      occasions, a more than ordinary degree of life-likeness in the\n      convulsive action.\n\n      It grew late. The day was about to dawn; and it was thought\n      expedient, at length, to proceed at once to the dissection. A\n      student, however, was especially desirous of testing a theory of\n      his own, and insisted upon applying the battery to one of the\n      pectoral muscles. A rough gash was made, and a wire hastily\n      brought in contact, when the patient, with a hurried but quite\n      unconvulsive movement, arose from the table, stepped into the\n      middle of the floor, gazed about him uneasily for a few seconds,\n      and then\u2014spoke. What he said was unintelligible, but words were\n      uttered; the syllabification was distinct. Having spoken, he fell\n      heavily to the floor.\n\n      For some moments all were paralyzed with awe\u2014but the urgency of\n      the case soon restored them their presence of mind. It was seen\n      that Mr. Stapleton was alive, although in a swoon. Upon\n      exhibition of ether he revived and was rapidly restored to\n      health, and to the society of his friends\u2014from whom, however, all\n      knowledge of his resuscitation was withheld, until a relapse was\n      no longer to be apprehended. Their wonder\u2014their rapturous\n      astonishment\u2014may be conceived.\n\n      The most thrilling peculiarity of this incident, nevertheless, is\n      involved in what Mr. S. himself asserts. He declares that at no\n      period was he altogether insensible\u2014that, dully and confusedly,\n      he was aware of everything which happened to him, from the moment\n      in which he was pronounced dead by his physicians, to that in\n      which he fell swooning to the floor of the hospital. \u201cI am\n      alive,\u201d were the uncomprehended words which, upon recognizing the\n      locality of the dissecting-room, he had endeavored, in his\n      extremity, to utter.\n\n      It were an easy matter to multiply such histories as these\u2014but I\n      forbear\u2014for, indeed, we have no need of such to establish the\n      fact that premature interments occur. When we reflect how very\n      rarely, from the nature of the case, we have it in our power to\n      detect them, we must admit that they may frequently occur without\n      our cognizance. Scarcely, in truth, is a graveyard ever\n      encroached upon, for any purpose, to any great extent, that\n      skeletons are not found in postures which suggest the most\n      fearful of suspicions.\n\n      Fearful indeed the suspicion\u2014but more fearful the doom! It may be\n      asserted, without hesitation, that no event is so terribly well\n      adapted to inspire the supremeness of bodily and of mental\n      distress, as is burial before death. The unendurable oppression\n      of the lungs\u2014the stifling fumes from the damp earth\u2014the clinging\n      to the death garments\u2014the rigid embrace of the narrow house\u2014the\n      blackness of the absolute Night\u2014the silence like a sea that\n      overwhelms\u2014the unseen but palpable presence of the Conqueror\n      Worm\u2014these things, with the thoughts of the air and grass above,\n      with memory of dear friends who would fly to save us if but\n      informed of our fate, and with consciousness that of this fate\n      they can never be informed\u2014that our hopeless portion is that of\n      the really dead\u2014these considerations, I say, carry into the\n      heart, which still palpitates, a degree of appalling and\n      intolerable horror from which the most daring imagination must\n      recoil. We know of nothing so agonizing upon Earth\u2014we can dream\n      of nothing half so hideous in the realms of the nethermost Hell.\n      And thus all narratives upon this topic have an interest\n      profound; an interest, nevertheless, which, through the sacred\n      awe of the topic itself, very properly and very peculiarly\n      depends upon our conviction of the truth of the matter narrated.\n      What I have now to tell is of my own actual knowledge\u2014of my own\n      positive and personal experience.\n\n      For several years I had been subject to attacks of the singular\n      disorder which physicians have agreed to term catalepsy, in\n      default of a more definitive title. Although both the immediate\n      and the predisposing causes, and even the actual diagnosis, of\n      this disease are still mysterious, its obvious and apparent\n      character is sufficiently well understood. Its variations seem to\n      be chiefly of degree. Sometimes the patient lies, for a day only,\n      or even for a shorter period, in a species of exaggerated\n      lethargy. He is senseless and externally motionless; but the\n      pulsation of the heart is still faintly perceptible; some traces\n      of warmth remain; a slight color lingers within the centre of the\n      cheek; and, upon application of a mirror to the lips, we can\n      detect a torpid, unequal, and vacillating action of the lungs.\n      Then again the duration of the trance is for weeks\u2014even for\n      months; while the closest scrutiny, and the most rigorous medical\n      tests, fail to establish any material distinction between the\n      state of the sufferer and what we conceive of absolute death.\n      Very usually he is saved from premature interment solely by the\n      knowledge of his friends that he has been previously subject to\n      catalepsy, by the consequent suspicion excited, and, above all,\n      by the non-appearance of decay. The advances of the malady are,\n      luckily, gradual. The first manifestations, although marked, are\n      unequivocal. The fits grow successively more and more\n      distinctive, and endure each for a longer term than the\n      preceding. In this lies the principal security from inhumation.\n      The unfortunate whose first attack should be of the extreme\n      character which is occasionally seen, would almost inevitably be\n      consigned alive to the tomb.\n\n      My own case differed in no important particular from those\n      mentioned in medical books. Sometimes, without any apparent\n      cause, I sank, little by little, into a condition of\n      semi-syncope, or half swoon; and, in this condition, without\n      pain, without ability to stir, or, strictly speaking, to think,\n      but with a dull lethargic consciousness of life and of the\n      presence of those who surrounded my bed, I remained, until the\n      crisis of the disease restored me, suddenly, to perfect\n      sensation. At other times I was quickly and impetuously smitten.\n      I grew sick, and numb, and chilly, and dizzy, and so fell\n      prostrate at once. Then, for weeks, all was void, and black, and\n      silent, and Nothing became the universe. Total annihilation could\n      be no more. From these latter attacks I awoke, however, with a\n      gradation slow in proportion to the suddenness of the seizure.\n      Just as the day dawns to the friendless and houseless beggar who\n      roams the streets throughout the long desolate winter night\u2014just\n      so tardily\u2014just so wearily\u2014just so cheerily came back the light\n      of the Soul to me.\n\n      Apart from the tendency to trance, however, my general health\n      appeared to be good; nor could I perceive that it was at all\n      affected by the one prevalent malady\u2014unless, indeed, an\n      idiosyncrasy in my ordinary sleep may be looked upon as\n      superinduced. Upon awaking from slumber, I could never gain, at\n      once, thorough possession of my senses, and always remained, for\n      many minutes, in much bewilderment and perplexity\u2014the mental\n      faculties in general, but the memory in especial, being in a\n      condition of absolute abeyance.\n\n      In all that I endured there was no physical suffering but of\n      moral distress an infinitude. My fancy grew charnel, I talked \u201cof\n      worms, of tombs, and epitaphs.\u201d I was lost in reveries of death,\n      and the idea of premature burial held continual possession of my\n      brain. The ghastly Danger to which I was subjected haunted me day\n      and night. In the former, the torture of meditation was\n      excessive\u2014in the latter, supreme. When the grim Darkness\n      overspread the Earth, then, with every horror of thought, I\n      shook\u2014shook as the quivering plumes upon the hearse. When Nature\n      could endure wakefulness no longer, it was with a struggle that I\n      consented to sleep\u2014for I shuddered to reflect that, upon awaking,\n      I might find myself the tenant of a grave. And when, finally, I\n      sank into slumber, it was only to rush at once into a world of\n      phantasms, above which, with vast, sable, overshadowing wing,\n      hovered, predominant, the one sepulchral Idea.\n\n      From the innumerable images of gloom which thus oppressed me in\n      dreams, I select for record but a solitary vision. Methought I\n      was immersed in a cataleptic trance of more than usual duration\n      and profundity. Suddenly there came an icy hand upon my forehead,\n      and an impatient, gibbering voice whispered the word \u201cArise!\u201d\n      within my ear.\n\n      I sat erect. The darkness was total. I could not see the figure\n      of him who had aroused me. I could call to mind neither the\n      period at which I had fallen into the trance, nor the locality in\n      which I then lay. While I remained motionless, and busied in\n      endeavors to collect my thought, the cold hand grasped me\n      fiercely by the wrist, shaking it petulantly, while the gibbering\n      voice said again:\n\n      \u201cArise! did I not bid thee arise?\u201d\n\n      \u201cAnd who,\u201d I demanded, \u201cart thou?\u201d\n\n      \u201cI have no name in the regions which I inhabit,\u201d replied the\n      voice, mournfully; \u201cI was mortal, but am fiend. I was merciless,\n      but am pitiful. Thou dost feel that I shudder. My teeth chatter\n      as I speak, yet it is not with the chilliness of the night\u2014of the\n      night without end. But this hideousness is insufferable. How\n      canst thou tranquilly sleep? I cannot rest for the cry of these\n      great agonies. These sights are more than I can bear. Get thee\n      up! Come with me into the outer Night, and let me unfold to thee\n      the graves. Is not this a spectacle of woe?\u2014Behold!\u201d\n\n      I looked; and the unseen figure, which still grasped me by the\n      wrist, had caused to be thrown open the graves of all mankind;\n      and from each issued the faint phosphoric radiance of decay; so\n      that I could see into the innermost recesses, and there view the\n      shrouded bodies in their sad and solemn slumbers with the worm.\n      But alas! the real sleepers were fewer, by many millions, than\n      those who slumbered not at all; and there was a feeble\n      struggling; and there was a general sad unrest; and from out the\n      depths of the countless pits there came a melancholy rustling\n      from the garments of the buried. And of those who seemed\n      tranquilly to repose, I saw that a vast number had changed, in a\n      greater or less degree, the rigid and uneasy position in which\n      they had originally been entombed. And the voice again said to me\n      as I gazed:\n\n      \u201cIs it not\u2014oh! is it _not_ a pitiful sight?\u201d But, before I could\n      find words to reply, the figure had ceased to grasp my wrist, the\n      phosphoric lights expired, and the graves were closed with a\n      sudden violence, while from out them arose a tumult of despairing\n      cries, saying again: \u201cIs it not\u2014O, God, is it _not_ a very\n      pitiful sight?\u201d\n\n      Phantasies such as these, presenting themselves at night,\n      extended their terrific influence far into my waking hours. My\n      nerves became thoroughly unstrung, and I fell a prey to perpetual\n      horror. I hesitated to ride, or to walk, or to indulge in any\n      exercise that would carry me from home. In fact, I no longer\n      dared trust myself out of the immediate presence of those who\n      were aware of my proneness to catalepsy, lest, falling into one\n      of my usual fits, I should be buried before my real condition\n      could be ascertained. I doubted the care, the fidelity of my\n      dearest friends. I dreaded that, in some trance of more than\n      customary duration, they might be prevailed upon to regard me as\n      irrecoverable. I even went so far as to fear that, as I\n      occasioned much trouble, they might be glad to consider any very\n      protracted attack as sufficient excuse for getting rid of me\n      altogether. It was in vain they endeavored to reassure me by the\n      most solemn promises. I exacted the most sacred oaths, that under\n      no circumstances they would bury me until decomposition had so\n      materially advanced as to render farther preservation impossible.\n      And, even then, my mortal terrors would listen to no reason\u2014would\n      accept no consolation. I entered into a series of elaborate\n      precautions. Among other things, I had the family vault so\n      remodelled as to admit of being readily opened from within. The\n      slightest pressure upon a long lever that extended far into the\n      tomb would cause the iron portal to fly back. There were\n      arrangements also for the free admission of air and light, and\n      convenient receptacles for food and water, within immediate reach\n      of the coffin intended for my reception. This coffin was warmly\n      and softly padded, and was provided with a lid, fashioned upon\n      the principle of the vault-door, with the addition of springs so\n      contrived that the feeblest movement of the body would be\n      sufficient to set it at liberty. Besides all this, there was\n      suspended from the roof of the tomb, a large bell, the rope of\n      which, it was designed, should extend through a hole in the\n      coffin, and so be fastened to one of the hands of the corpse.\n      But, alas? what avails the vigilance against the Destiny of man?\n      Not even these well-contrived securities sufficed to save from\n      the uttermost agonies of living inhumation, a wretch to these\n      agonies foredoomed!\n\n      There arrived an epoch\u2014as often before there had arrived\u2014in which\n      I found myself emerging from total unconsciousness into the first\n      feeble and indefinite sense of existence. Slowly\u2014with a tortoise\n      gradation\u2014approached the faint gray dawn of the psychal day. A\n      torpid uneasiness. An apathetic endurance of dull pain. No\n      care\u2014no hope\u2014no effort. Then, after a long interval, a ringing in\n      the ears; then, after a lapse still longer, a prickling or\n      tingling sensation in the extremities; then a seemingly eternal\n      period of pleasurable quiescence, during which the awakening\n      feelings are struggling into thought; then a brief re-sinking\n      into non-entity; then a sudden recovery. At length the slight\n      quivering of an eyelid, and immediately thereupon, an electric\n      shock of a terror, deadly and indefinite, which sends the blood\n      in torrents from the temples to the heart. And now the first\n      positive effort to think. And now the first endeavor to remember.\n      And now a partial and evanescent success. And now the memory has\n      so far regained its dominion, that, in some measure, I am\n      cognizant of my state. I feel that I am not awaking from ordinary\n      sleep. I recollect that I have been subject to catalepsy. And\n      now, at last, as if by the rush of an ocean, my shuddering spirit\n      is overwhelmed by the one grim Danger\u2014by the one spectral and\n      ever-prevalent idea.\n\n      For some minutes after this fancy possessed me, I remained\n      without motion. And why? I could not summon courage to move. I\n      dared not make the effort which was to satisfy me of my fate\u2014and\n      yet there was something at my heart which whispered me it was\n      sure. Despair\u2014such as no other species of wretchedness ever calls\n      into being\u2014despair alone urged me, after long irresolution, to\n      uplift the heavy lids of my eyes. I uplifted them. It was\n      dark\u2014all dark. I knew that the fit was over. I knew that the\n      crisis of my disorder had long passed. I knew that I had now\n      fully recovered the use of my visual faculties\u2014and yet it was\n      dark\u2014all dark\u2014the intense and utter raylessness of the Night that\n      endureth for evermore.\n\n      I endeavored to shriek; and my lips and my parched tongue moved\n      convulsively together in the attempt\u2014but no voice issued from the\n      cavernous lungs, which oppressed as if by the weight of some\n      incumbent mountain, gasped and palpitated, with the heart, at\n      every elaborate and struggling inspiration.\n\n      The movement of the jaws, in this effort to cry aloud, showed me\n      that they were bound up, as is usual with the dead. I felt, too,\n      that I lay upon some hard substance; and by something similar my\n      sides were, also, closely compressed. So far, I had not ventured\n      to stir any of my limbs\u2014but now I violently threw up my arms,\n      which had been lying at length, with the wrists crossed. They\n      struck a solid wooden substance, which extended above my person\n      at an elevation of not more than six inches from my face. I could\n      no longer doubt that I reposed within a coffin at last.\n\n      And now, amid all my infinite miseries, came sweetly the cherub\n      Hope\u2014for I thought of my precautions. I writhed, and made\n      spasmodic exertions to force open the lid: it would not move. I\n      felt my wrists for the bell-rope: it was not to be found. And now\n      the Comforter fled for ever, and a still sterner Despair reigned\n      triumphant; for I could not help perceiving the absence of the\n      paddings which I had so carefully prepared\u2014and then, too, there\n      came suddenly to my nostrils the strong peculiar odor of moist\n      earth. The conclusion was irresistible. I was not within the\n      vault. I had fallen into a trance while absent from home\u2014while\n      among strangers\u2014when, or how, I could not remember\u2014and it was\n      they who had buried me as a dog\u2014nailed up in some common\n      coffin\u2014and thrust deep, deep, and for ever, into some ordinary\n      and nameless grave.\n\n      As this awful conviction forced itself, thus, into the innermost\n      chambers of my soul, I once again struggled to cry aloud. And in\n      this second endeavor I succeeded. A long, wild, and continuous\n      shriek, or yell of agony, resounded through the realms of the\n      subterranean Night.\n\n      \u201cHillo! hillo, there!\u201d said a gruff voice, in reply.\n\n      \u201cWhat the devil\u2019s the matter now!\u201d said a second.\n\n      \u201cGet out o\u2019 that!\u201d said a third.\n\n      \u201cWhat do you mean by yowling in that ere kind of style, like a\n      cattymount?\u201d said a fourth; and hereupon I was seized and shaken\n      without ceremony, for several minutes, by a junto of very\n      rough-looking individuals. They did not arouse me from my\n      slumber\u2014for I was wide awake when I screamed\u2014but they restored me\n      to the full possession of my memory.\n\n      This adventure occurred near Richmond, in Virginia. Accompanied\n      by a friend, I had proceeded, upon a gunning expedition, some\n      miles down the banks of the James River. Night approached, and we\n      were overtaken by a storm. The cabin of a small sloop lying at\n      anchor in the stream, and laden with garden mould, afforded us\n      the only available shelter. We made the best of it, and passed\n      the night on board. I slept in one of the only two berths in the\n      vessel\u2014and the berths of a sloop of sixty or twenty tons need\n      scarcely be described. That which I occupied had no bedding of\n      any kind. Its extreme width was eighteen inches. The distance of\n      its bottom from the deck overhead was precisely the same. I found\n      it a matter of exceeding difficulty to squeeze myself in.\n      Nevertheless, I slept soundly, and the whole of my vision\u2014for it\n      was no dream, and no nightmare\u2014arose naturally from the\n      circumstances of my position\u2014from my ordinary bias of thought\u2014and\n      from the difficulty, to which I have alluded, of collecting my\n      senses, and especially of regaining my memory, for a long time\n      after awaking from slumber. The men who shook me were the crew of\n      the sloop, and some laborers engaged to unload it. From the load\n      itself came the earthly smell. The bandage about the jaws was a\n      silk handkerchief in which I had bound up my head, in default of\n      my customary nightcap.\n\n      The tortures endured, however, were indubitably quite equal for\n      the time, to those of actual sepulture. They were fearfully\u2014they\n      were inconceivably hideous; but out of Evil proceeded Good; for\n      their very excess wrought in my spirit an inevitable revulsion.\n      My soul acquired tone\u2014acquired temper. I went abroad. I took\n      vigorous exercise. I breathed the free air of Heaven. I thought\n      upon other subjects than Death. I discarded my medical books.\n      \u201cBuchan\u201d I burned. I read no \u201cNight Thoughts\u201d\u2014no fustian about\n      churchyards\u2014no bugaboo tales\u2014such as this. In short, I became a\n      new man, and lived a man\u2019s life. From that memorable night, I\n      dismissed forever my charnel apprehensions, and with them\n      vanished the cataleptic disorder, of which, perhaps, they had\n      been less the consequence than the cause.\n\n      There are moments when, even to the sober eye of Reason, the\n      world of our sad Humanity may assume the semblance of a Hell\u2014but\n      the imagination of man is no Carathis, to explore with impunity\n      its every cavern. Alas! the grim legion of sepulchral terrors\n      cannot be regarded as altogether fanciful\u2014but, like the Demons in\n      whose company Afrasiab made his voyage down the Oxus, they must\n      sleep, or they will devour us\u2014they must be suffered to slumber,\n      or we perish.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DOMAIN OF ARNHEIM\n\n\nThe garden like a lady fair was cut,\n    That lay as if she slumbered in delight,\nAnd to the open skies her eyes did shut.\n    The azure fields of Heaven were \u2019sembled right\n    In a large round, set with the flowers of light.\nThe flowers de luce, and the round sparks of dew\nThat hung upon their azure leaves did shew\nLike twinkling stars that sparkle in the evening blue.\n                    \u2014_Giles Fletcher_.\n\n      From his cradle to his grave a gale of prosperity bore my friend\n      Ellison along. Nor do I use the word prosperity in its mere\n      worldly sense. I mean it as synonymous with happiness. The person\n      of whom I speak seemed born for the purpose of foreshadowing the\n      doctrines of Turgot, Price, Priestley, and Condorcet\u2014of\n      exemplifying by individual instance what has been deemed the\n      chimera of the perfectionists. In the brief existence of Ellison\n      I fancy that I have seen refuted the dogma, that in man\u2019s very\n      nature lies some hidden principle, the antagonist of bliss. An\n      anxious examination of his career has given me to understand that\n      in general, from the violation of a few simple laws of humanity\n      arises the wretchedness of mankind\u2014that as a species we have in\n      our possession the as yet unwrought elements of content\u2014and that,\n      even now, in the present darkness and madness of all thought on\n      the great question of the social condition, it is not impossible\n      that man, the individual, under certain unusual and highly\n      fortuitous conditions, may be happy.\n\n      With opinions such as these my young friend, too, was fully\n      imbued, and thus it is worthy of observation that the\n      uninterrupted enjoyment which distinguished his life was, in\n      great measure, the result of preconcert. It is indeed evident\n      that with less of the instinctive philosophy which, now and then,\n      stands so well in the stead of experience, Mr. Ellison would have\n      found himself precipitated, by the very extraordinary success of\n      his life, into the common vortex of unhappiness which yawns for\n      those of pre-eminent endowments. But it is by no means my object\n      to pen an essay on happiness. The ideas of my friend may be\n      summed up in a few words. He admitted but four elementary\n      principles, or more strictly, conditions of bliss. That which he\n      considered chief was (strange to say!) the simple and purely\n      physical one of free exercise in the open air. \u201cThe health,\u201d he\n      said, \u201cattainable by other means is scarcely worth the name.\u201d He\n      instanced the ecstasies of the fox-hunter, and pointed to the\n      tillers of the earth, the only people who, as a class, can be\n      fairly considered happier than others. His second condition was\n      the love of woman. His third, and most difficult of realization,\n      was the contempt of ambition. His fourth was an object of\n      unceasing pursuit; and he held that, other things being equal,\n      the extent of attainable happiness was in proportion to the\n      spirituality of this object.\n\n      Ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good gifts\n      lavished upon him by fortune. In personal grace and beauty he\n      exceeded all men. His intellect was of that order to which the\n      acquisition of knowledge is less a labor than an intuition and a\n      necessity. His family was one of the most illustrious of the\n      empire. His bride was the loveliest and most devoted of women.\n      His possessions had been always ample; but on the attainment of\n      his majority, it was discovered that one of those extraordinary\n      freaks of fate had been played in his behalf which startle the\n      whole social world amid which they occur, and seldom fail\n      radically to alter the moral constitution of those who are their\n      objects.\n\n      It appears that about a hundred years before Mr. Ellison\u2019s coming\n      of age, there had died, in a remote province, one Mr. Seabright\n      Ellison. This gentleman had amassed a princely fortune, and,\n      having no immediate connections, conceived the whim of suffering\n      his wealth to accumulate for a century after his decease.\n      Minutely and sagaciously directing the various modes of\n      investment, he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the nearest of\n      blood, bearing the name of Ellison, who should be alive at the\n      end of the hundred years. Many attempts had been made to set\n      aside this singular bequest; their ex post facto character\n      rendered them abortive; but the attention of a jealous government\n      was aroused, and a legislative act finally obtained, forbidding\n      all similar accumulations. This act, however, did not prevent\n      young Ellison from entering into possession, on his twenty-first\n      birthday, as the heir of his ancestor Seabright, of a fortune of\n      four hundred and fifty millions of dollars. (*1)\n\n      When it had become known that such was the enormous wealth\n      inherited, there were, of course, many speculations as to the\n      mode of its disposal. The magnitude and the immediate\n      availability of the sum bewildered all who thought on the topic.\n      The possessor of any appreciable amount of money might have been\n      imagined to perform any one of a thousand things. With riches\n      merely surpassing those of any citizen, it would have been easy\n      to suppose him engaging to supreme excess in the fashionable\n      extravagances of his time\u2014or busying himself with political\n      intrigue\u2014or aiming at ministerial power\u2014or purchasing increase of\n      nobility\u2014or collecting large museums of virtu\u2014or playing the\n      munificent patron of letters, of science, of art\u2014or endowing, and\n      bestowing his name upon extensive institutions of charity. But\n      for the inconceivable wealth in the actual possession of the\n      heir, these objects and all ordinary objects were felt to afford\n      too limited a field. Recourse was had to figures, and these but\n      sufficed to confound. It was seen that, even at three per cent.,\n      the annual income of the inheritance amounted to no less than\n      thirteen millions and five hundred thousand dollars; which was\n      one million and one hundred and twenty-five thousand per month;\n      or thirty-six thousand nine hundred and eighty-six per day; or\n      one thousand five hundred and forty-one per hour; or six and\n      twenty dollars for every minute that flew. Thus the usual track\n      of supposition was thoroughly broken up. Men knew not what to\n      imagine. There were some who even conceived that Mr. Ellison\n      would divest himself of at least one-half of his fortune, as of\n      utterly superfluous opulence\u2014enriching whole troops of his\n      relatives by division of his superabundance. To the nearest of\n      these he did, in fact, abandon the very unusual wealth which was\n      his own before the inheritance.\n\n      I was not surprised, however, to perceive that he had long made\n      up his mind on a point which had occasioned so much discussion to\n      his friends. Nor was I greatly astonished at the nature of his\n      decision. In regard to individual charities he had satisfied his\n      conscience. In the possibility of any improvement, properly so\n      called, being effected by man himself in the general condition of\n      man, he had (I am sorry to confess it) little faith. Upon the\n      whole, whether happily or unhappily, he was thrown back, in very\n      great measure, upon self.\n\n      In the widest and noblest sense he was a poet. He comprehended,\n      moreover, the true character, the august aims, the supreme\n      majesty and dignity of the poetic sentiment. The fullest, if not\n      the sole proper satisfaction of this sentiment he instinctively\n      felt to lie in the creation of novel forms of beauty. Some\n      peculiarities, either in his early education, or in the nature of\n      his intellect, had tinged with what is termed materialism all his\n      ethical speculations; and it was this bias, perhaps, which led\n      him to believe that the most advantageous at least, if not the\n      sole legitimate field for the poetic exercise, lies in the\n      creation of novel moods of purely physical loveliness. Thus it\n      happened he became neither musician nor poet\u2014if we use this\n      latter term in its every-day acceptation. Or it might have been\n      that he neglected to become either, merely in pursuance of his\n      idea that in contempt of ambition is to be found one of the\n      essential principles of happiness on earth. Is it not indeed,\n      possible that, while a high order of genius is necessarily\n      ambitious, the highest is above that which is termed ambition?\n      And may it not thus happen that many far greater than Milton have\n      contentedly remained \u201cmute and inglorious?\u201d I believe that the\n      world has never seen\u2014and that, unless through some series of\n      accidents goading the noblest order of mind into distasteful\n      exertion, the world will never see\u2014that full extent of triumphant\n      execution, in the richer domains of art, of which the human\n      nature is absolutely capable.\n\n      Ellison became neither musician nor poet; although no man lived\n      more profoundly enamored of music and poetry. Under other\n      circumstances than those which invested him, it is not impossible\n      that he would have become a painter. Sculpture, although in its\n      nature rigorously poetical was too limited in its extent and\n      consequences, to have occupied, at any time, much of his\n      attention. And I have now mentioned all the provinces in which\n      the common understanding of the poetic sentiment has declared it\n      capable of expatiating. But Ellison maintained that the richest,\n      the truest, and most natural, if not altogether the most\n      extensive province, had been unaccountably neglected. No\n      definition had spoken of the landscape-gardener as of the poet;\n      yet it seemed to my friend that the creation of the\n      landscape-garden offered to the proper Muse the most magnificent\n      of opportunities. Here, indeed, was the fairest field for the\n      display of imagination in the endless combining of forms of novel\n      beauty; the elements to enter into combination being, by a vast\n      superiority, the most glorious which the earth could afford. In\n      the multiform and multicolor of the flowers and the trees, he\n      recognised the most direct and energetic efforts of Nature at\n      physical loveliness. And in the direction or concentration of\n      this effort\u2014or, more properly, in its adaptation to the eyes\n      which were to behold it on earth\u2014he perceived that he should be\n      employing the best means\u2014laboring to the greatest advantage\u2014in\n      the fulfilment, not only of his own destiny as poet, but of the\n      august purposes for which the Deity had implanted the poetic\n      sentiment in man.\n\n      \u201cIts adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on earth.\u201d In\n      his explanation of this phraseology, Mr. Ellison did much toward\n      solving what has always seemed to me an enigma:\u2014I mean the fact\n      (which none but the ignorant dispute) that no such combination of\n      scenery exists in nature as the painter of genius may produce. No\n      such paradises are to be found in reality as have glowed on the\n      canvas of Claude. In the most enchanting of natural landscapes,\n      there will always be found a defect or an excess\u2014many excesses\n      and defects. While the component parts may defy, individually,\n      the highest skill of the artist, the arrangement of these parts\n      will always be susceptible of improvement. In short, no position\n      can be attained on the wide surface of the natural earth, from\n      which an artistical eye, looking steadily, will not find matter\n      of offence in what is termed the \u201ccomposition\u201d of the landscape.\n      And yet how unintelligible is this! In all other matters we are\n      justly instructed to regard nature as supreme. With her details\n      we shrink from competition. Who shall presume to imitate the\n      colors of the tulip, or to improve the proportions of the lily of\n      the valley? The criticism which says, of sculpture or\n      portraiture, that here nature is to be exalted or idealized\n      rather than imitated, is in error. No pictorial or sculptural\n      combinations of points of human liveliness do more than approach\n      the living and breathing beauty. In landscape alone is the\n      principle of the critic true; and, having felt its truth here, it\n      is but the headlong spirit of generalization which has led him to\n      pronounce it true throughout all the domains of art. Having, I\n      say, felt its truth here; for the feeling is no affectation or\n      chimera. The mathematics afford no more absolute demonstrations\n      than the sentiments of his art yields the artist. He not only\n      believes, but positively knows, that such and such apparently\n      arbitrary arrangements of matter constitute and alone constitute\n      the true beauty. His reasons, however, have not yet been matured\n      into expression. It remains for a more profound analysis than the\n      world has yet seen, fully to investigate and express them.\n      Nevertheless he is confirmed in his instinctive opinions by the\n      voice of all his brethren. Let a \u201ccomposition\u201d be defective; let\n      an emendation be wrought in its mere arrangement of form; let\n      this emendation be submitted to every artist in the world; by\n      each will its necessity be admitted. And even far more than this;\n      in remedy of the defective composition, each insulated member of\n      the fraternity would have suggested the identical emendation.\n\n      I repeat that in landscape arrangements alone is the physical\n      nature susceptible of exaltation, and that, therefore, her\n      susceptibility of improvement at this one point, was a mystery I\n      had been unable to solve. My own thoughts on the subject had\n      rested in the idea that the primitive intention of nature would\n      have so arranged the earth\u2019s surface as to have fulfilled at all\n      points man\u2019s sense of perfection in the beautiful, the sublime,\n      or the picturesque; but that this primitive intention had been\n      frustrated by the known geological disturbances\u2014disturbances of\n      form and color\u2014grouping, in the correction or allaying of which\n      lies the soul of art. The force of this idea was much weakened,\n      however, by the necessity which it involved of considering the\n      disturbances abnormal and unadapted to any purpose. It was\n      Ellison who suggested that they were prognostic of death. He thus\n      explained:\u2014Admit the earthly immortality of man to have been the\n      first intention. We have then the primitive arrangement of the\n      earth\u2019s surface adapted to his blissful estate, as not existent\n      but designed. The disturbances were the preparations for his\n      subsequently conceived deathful condition.\n\n      \u201cNow,\u201d said my friend, \u201cwhat we regard as exaltation of the\n      landscape may be really such, as respects only the moral or human\n      point of view. Each alteration of the natural scenery may\n      possibly effect a blemish in the picture, if we can suppose this\n      picture viewed at large\u2014in mass\u2014from some point distant from the\n      earth\u2019s surface, although not beyond the limits of its\n      atmosphere. It is easily understood that what might improve a\n      closely scrutinized detail, may at the same time injure a general\n      or more distantly observed effect. There may be a class of\n      beings, human once, but now invisible to humanity, to whom, from\n      afar, our disorder may seem order\u2014our unpicturesqueness\n      picturesque; in a word, the earth-angels, for whose scrutiny more\n      especially than our own, and for whose death-refined appreciation\n      of the beautiful, may have been set in array by God the wide\n      landscape-gardens of the hemispheres.\u201d\n\n      In the course of discussion, my friend quoted some passages from\n      a writer on landscape-gardening who has been supposed to have\n      well treated his theme:\n\n      \u201cThere are properly but two styles of landscape-gardening, the\n      natural and the artificial. One seeks to recall the original\n      beauty of the country, by adapting its means to the surrounding\n      scenery, cultivating trees in harmony with the hills or plain of\n      the neighboring land; detecting and bringing into practice those\n      nice relations of size, proportion, and color which, hid from the\n      common observer, are revealed everywhere to the experienced\n      student of nature. The result of the natural style of gardening,\n      is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities\u2014in\n      the prevalence of a healthy harmony and order\u2014than in the\n      creation of any special wonders or miracles. The artificial style\n      has as many varieties as there are different tastes to gratify.\n      It has a certain general relation to the various styles of\n      building. There are the stately avenues and retirements of\n      Versailles; Italian terraces; and a various mixed old English\n      style, which bears some relation to the domestic Gothic or\n      English Elizabethan architecture. Whatever may be said against\n      the abuses of the artificial landscape-gardening, a mixture of\n      pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty. This is\n      partly pleasing to the eye, by the show of order and design, and\n      partly moral. A terrace, with an old moss-covered balustrade,\n      calls up at once to the eye the fair forms that have passed there\n      in other days. The slightest exhibition of art is an evidence of\n      care and human interest.\u201d\n\n      \u201cFrom what I have already observed,\u201d said Ellison, \u201cyou will\n      understand that I reject the idea, here expressed, of recalling\n      the original beauty of the country. The original beauty is never\n      so great as that which may be introduced. Of course, every thing\n      depends on the selection of a spot with capabilities. What is\n      said about detecting and bringing into practice nice relations of\n      size, proportion, and color, is one of those mere vaguenesses of\n      speech which serve to veil inaccuracy of thought. The phrase\n      quoted may mean any thing, or nothing, and guides in no degree.\n      That the true result of the natural style of gardening is seen\n      rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities than in\n      the creation of any special wonders or miracles, is a proposition\n      better suited to the grovelling apprehension of the herd than to\n      the fervid dreams of the man of genius. The negative merit\n      suggested appertains to that hobbling criticism which, in\n      letters, would elevate Addison into apotheosis. In truth, while\n      that virtue which consists in the mere avoidance of vice appeals\n      directly to the understanding, and can thus be circumscribed in\n      rule, the loftier virtue, which flames in creation, can be\n      apprehended in its results alone. Rule applies but to the merits\n      of denial\u2014to the excellencies which refrain. Beyond these, the\n      critical art can but suggest. We may be instructed to build a\n      \u201cCato,\u201d but we are in vain told how to conceive a Parthenon or an\n      \u201cInferno.\u201d The thing done, however; the wonder accomplished; and\n      the capacity for apprehension becomes universal. The sophists of\n      the negative school who, through inability to create, have\n      scoffed at creation, are now found the loudest in applause. What,\n      in its chrysalis condition of principle, affronted their demure\n      reason, never fails, in its maturity of accomplishment, to extort\n      admiration from their instinct of beauty.\n\n      \u201cThe author\u2019s observations on the artificial style,\u201d continued\n      Ellison, \u201care less objectionable. A mixture of pure art in a\n      garden scene adds to it a great beauty. This is just; as also is\n      the reference to the sense of human interest. The principle\n      expressed is incontrovertible\u2014but there may be something beyond\n      it. There may be an object in keeping with the principle\u2014an\n      object unattainable by the means ordinarily possessed by\n      individuals, yet which, if attained, would lend a charm to the\n      landscape-garden far surpassing that which a sense of merely\n      human interest could bestow. A poet, having very unusual\n      pecuniary resources, might, while retaining the necessary idea of\n      art or culture, or, as our author expresses it, of interest, so\n      imbue his designs at once with extent and novelty of beauty, as\n      to convey the sentiment of spiritual interference. It will be\n      seen that, in bringing about such result, he secures all the\n      advantages of interest or design, while relieving his work of the\n      harshness or technicality of the worldly art. In the most rugged\n      of wildernesses\u2014in the most savage of the scenes of pure\n      nature\u2014there is apparent the art of a creator; yet this art is\n      apparent to reflection only; in no respect has it the obvious\n      force of a feeling. Now let us suppose this sense of the Almighty\n      design to be one step depressed\u2014to be brought into something like\n      harmony or consistency with the sense of human art\u2014to form an\n      intermedium between the two:\u2014let us imagine, for example, a\n      landscape whose combined vastness and definitiveness\u2014whose united\n      beauty, magnificence, and strangeness, shall convey the idea of\n      care, or culture, or superintendence, on the part of beings\n      superior, yet akin to humanity\u2014then the sentiment of interest is\n      preserved, while the art intervolved is made to assume the air of\n      an intermediate or secondary nature\u2014a nature which is not God,\n      nor an emanation from God, but which still is nature in the sense\n      of the handiwork of the angels that hover between man and God.\u201d\n\n      It was in devoting his enormous wealth to the embodiment of a\n      vision such as this\u2014in the free exercise in the open air ensured\n      by the personal superintendence of his plans\u2014in the unceasing\n      object which these plans afforded\u2014in the high spirituality of the\n      object\u2014in the contempt of ambition which it enabled him truly to\n      feel\u2014in the perennial springs with which it gratified, without\n      possibility of satiating, that one master passion of his soul,\n      the thirst for beauty, above all, it was in the sympathy of a\n      woman, not unwomanly, whose loveliness and love enveloped his\n      existence in the purple atmosphere of Paradise, that Ellison\n      thought to find, and found, exemption from the ordinary cares of\n      humanity, with a far greater amount of positive happiness than\n      ever glowed in the rapt day-dreams of De Sta\u00ebl.\n\n      I despair of conveying to the reader any distinct conception of\n      the marvels which my friend did actually accomplish. I wish to\n      describe, but am disheartened by the difficulty of description,\n      and hesitate between detail and generality. Perhaps the better\n      course will be to unite the two in their extremes.\n\n      Mr. Ellison\u2019s first step regarded, of course, the choice of a\n      locality, and scarcely had he commenced thinking on this point,\n      when the luxuriant nature of the Pacific Islands arrested his\n      attention. In fact, he had made up his mind for a voyage to the\n      South Seas, when a night\u2019s reflection induced him to abandon the\n      idea. \u201cWere I misanthropic,\u201d he said, \u201csuch a locale would suit\n      me. The thoroughness of its insulation and seclusion, and the\n      difficulty of ingress and egress, would in such case be the charm\n      of charms; but as yet I am not Timon. I wish the composure but\n      not the depression of solitude. There must remain with me a\n      certain control over the extent and duration of my repose. There\n      will be frequent hours in which I shall need, too, the sympathy\n      of the poetic in what I have done. Let me seek, then, a spot not\n      far from a populous city\u2014whose vicinity, also, will best enable\n      me to execute my plans.\u201d\n\n      In search of a suitable place so situated, Ellison travelled for\n      several years, and I was permitted to accompany him. A thousand\n      spots with which I was enraptured he rejected without hesitation,\n      for reasons which satisfied me, in the end, that he was right. We\n      came at length to an elevated table-land of wonderful fertility\n      and beauty, affording a panoramic prospect very little less in\n      extent than that of Aetna, and, in Ellison\u2019s opinion as well as\n      my own, surpassing the far-famed view from that mountain in all\n      the true elements of the picturesque.\n\n      \u201cI am aware,\u201d said the traveller, as he drew a sigh of deep\n      delight after gazing on this scene, entranced, for nearly an\n      hour, \u201cI know that here, in my circumstances, nine-tenths of the\n      most fastidious of men would rest content. This panorama is\n      indeed glorious, and I should rejoice in it but for the excess of\n      its glory. The taste of all the architects I have ever known\n      leads them, for the sake of \u2018prospect,\u2019 to put up buildings on\n      hill-tops. The error is obvious. Grandeur in any of its moods,\n      but especially in that of extent, startles, excites\u2014and then\n      fatigues, depresses. For the occasional scene nothing can be\n      better\u2014for the constant view nothing worse. And, in the constant\n      view, the most objectionable phase of grandeur is that of extent;\n      the worst phase of extent, that of distance. It is at war with\n      the sentiment and with the sense of seclusion\u2014the sentiment and\n      sense which we seek to humor in \u2018retiring to the country.\u2019 In\n      looking from the summit of a mountain we cannot help feeling\n      abroad in the world. The heart-sick avoid distant prospects as a\n      pestilence.\u201d\n\n      It was not until toward the close of the fourth year of our\n      search that we found a locality with which Ellison professed\n      himself satisfied. It is, of course, needless to say where was\n      the locality. The late death of my friend, in causing his domain\n      to be thrown open to certain classes of visitors, has given to\n      Arnheim a species of secret and subdued if not solemn celebrity,\n      similar in kind, although infinitely superior in degree, to that\n      which so long distinguished Fonthill.\n\n      The usual approach to Arnheim was by the river. The visitor left\n      the city in the early morning. During the forenoon he passed\n      between shores of a tranquil and domestic beauty, on which grazed\n      innumerable sheep, their white fleeces spotting the vivid green\n      of rolling meadows. By degrees the idea of cultivation subsided\n      into that of merely pastoral care. This slowly became merged in a\n      sense of retirement\u2014this again in a consciousness of solitude. As\n      the evening approached, the channel grew more narrow; the banks\n      more and more precipitous; and these latter were clothed in rich,\n      more profuse, and more sombre foliage. The water increased in\n      transparency. The stream took a thousand turns, so that at no\n      moment could its gleaming surface be seen for a greater distance\n      than a furlong. At every instant the vessel seemed imprisoned\n      within an enchanted circle, having insuperable and impenetrable\n      walls of foliage, a roof of ultramarine satin, and no floor\u2014the\n      keel balancing itself with admirable nicety on that of a phantom\n      bark which, by some accident having been turned upside down,\n      floated in constant company with the substantial one, for the\n      purpose of sustaining it. The channel now became a gorge\u2014although\n      the term is somewhat inapplicable, and I employ it merely because\n      the language has no word which better represents the most\n      striking\u2014not the most distinctive\u2014feature of the scene. The\n      character of gorge was maintained only in the height and\n      parallelism of the shores; it was lost altogether in their other\n      traits. The walls of the ravine (through which the clear water\n      still tranquilly flowed) arose to an elevation of a hundred and\n      occasionally of a hundred and fifty feet, and inclined so much\n      toward each other as, in a great measure, to shut out the light\n      of day; while the long plume-like moss which depended densely\n      from the intertwining shrubberies overhead, gave the whole chasm\n      an air of funereal gloom. The windings became more frequent and\n      intricate, and seemed often as if returning in upon themselves,\n      so that the voyager had long lost all idea of direction. He was,\n      moreover, enwrapt in an exquisite sense of the strange. The\n      thought of nature still remained, but her character seemed to\n      have undergone modification, there was a weird symmetry, a\n      thrilling uniformity, a wizard propriety in these her works. Not\n      a dead branch\u2014not a withered leaf\u2014not a stray pebble\u2014not a patch\n      of the brown earth was anywhere visible. The crystal water welled\n      up against the clean granite, or the unblemished moss, with a\n      sharpness of outline that delighted while it bewildered the eye.\n\n      Having threaded the mazes of this channel for some hours, the\n      gloom deepening every moment, a sharp and unexpected turn of the\n      vessel brought it suddenly, as if dropped from heaven, into a\n      circular basin of very considerable extent when compared with the\n      width of the gorge. It was about two hundred yards in diameter,\n      and girt in at all points but one\u2014that immediately fronting the\n      vessel as it entered\u2014by hills equal in general height to the\n      walls of the chasm, although of a thoroughly different character.\n      Their sides sloped from the water\u2019s edge at an angle of some\n      forty-five degrees, and they were clothed from base to summit\u2014not\n      a perceptible point escaping\u2014in a drapery of the most gorgeous\n      flower-blossoms; scarcely a green leaf being visible among the\n      sea of odorous and fluctuating color. This basin was of great\n      depth, but so transparent was the water that the bottom, which\n      seemed to consist of a thick mass of small round alabaster\n      pebbles, was distinctly visible by glimpses\u2014that is to say,\n      whenever the eye could permit itself not to see, far down in the\n      inverted heaven, the duplicate blooming of the hills. On these\n      latter there were no trees, nor even shrubs of any size. The\n      impressions wrought on the observer were those of richness,\n      warmth, color, quietude, uniformity, softness, delicacy,\n      daintiness, voluptuousness, and a miraculous extremeness of\n      culture that suggested dreams of a new race of fairies,\n      laborious, tasteful, magnificent, and fastidious; but as the eye\n      traced upward the myriad-tinted slope, from its sharp junction\n      with the water to its vague termination amid the folds of\n      overhanging cloud, it became, indeed, difficult not to fancy a\n      panoramic cataract of rubies, sapphires, opals, and golden\n      onyxes, rolling silently out of the sky.\n\n      The visitor, shooting suddenly into this bay from out the gloom\n      of the ravine, is delighted but astounded by the full orb of the\n      declining sun, which he had supposed to be already far below the\n      horizon, but which now confronts him, and forms the sole\n      termination of an otherwise limitless vista seen through another\n      chasm-like rift in the hills.\n\n      But here the voyager quits the vessel which has borne him so far,\n      and descends into a light canoe of ivory, stained with arabesque\n      devices in vivid scarlet, both within and without. The poop and\n      beak of this boat arise high above the water, with sharp points,\n      so that the general form is that of an irregular crescent. It\n      lies on the surface of the bay with the proud grace of a swan. On\n      its ermined floor reposes a single feathery paddle of satin-wood;\n      but no oarsmen or attendant is to be seen. The guest is bidden to\n      be of good cheer\u2014that the fates will take care of him. The larger\n      vessel disappears, and he is left alone in the canoe, which lies\n      apparently motionless in the middle of the lake. While he\n      considers what course to pursue, however, he becomes aware of a\n      gentle movement in the fairy bark. It slowly swings itself around\n      until its prow points toward the sun. It advances with a gentle\n      but gradually accelerated velocity, while the slight ripples it\n      creates seem to break about the ivory side in divinest\n      melody\u2014seem to offer the only possible explanation of the\n      soothing yet melancholy music for whose unseen origin the\n      bewildered voyager looks around him in vain.\n\n      The canoe steadily proceeds, and the rocky gate of the vista is\n      approached, so that its depths can be more distinctly seen. To\n      the right arise a chain of lofty hills rudely and luxuriantly\n      wooded. It is observed, however, that the trait of exquisite\n      cleanness where the bank dips into the water, still prevails.\n      There is not one token of the usual river _d\u00e9bris_. To the left\n      the character of the scene is softer and more obviously\n      artificial. Here the bank slopes upward from the stream in a very\n      gentle ascent, forming a broad sward of grass of a texture\n      resembling nothing so much as velvet, and of a brilliancy of\n      green which would bear comparison with the tint of the purest\n      emerald. This plateau varies in width from ten to three hundred\n      yards; reaching from the river-bank to a wall, fifty feet high,\n      which extends, in an infinity of curves, but following the\n      general direction of the river, until lost in the distance to the\n      westward. This wall is of one continuous rock, and has been\n      formed by cutting perpendicularly the once rugged precipice of\n      the stream\u2019s southern bank, but no trace of the labor has been\n      suffered to remain. The chiselled stone has the hue of ages, and\n      is profusely overhung and overspread with the ivy, the coral\n      honeysuckle, the eglantine, and the clematis. The uniformity of\n      the top and bottom lines of the wall is fully relieved by\n      occasional trees of gigantic height, growing singly or in small\n      groups, both along the plateau and in the domain behind the wall,\n      but in close proximity to it; so that frequent limbs (of the\n      black walnut especially) reach over and dip their pendent\n      extremities into the water. Farther back within the domain, the\n      vision is impeded by an impenetrable screen of foliage.\n\n      These things are observed during the canoe\u2019s gradual approach to\n      what I have called the gate of the vista. On drawing nearer to\n      this, however, its chasm-like appearance vanishes; a new outlet\n      from the bay is discovered to the left\u2014in which direction the\n      wall is also seen to sweep, still following the general course of\n      the stream. Down this new opening the eye cannot penetrate very\n      far; for the stream, accompanied by the wall, still bends to the\n      left, until both are swallowed up by the leaves.\n\n      The boat, nevertheless, glides magically into the winding\n      channel; and here the shore opposite the wall is found to\n      resemble that opposite the wall in the straight vista. Lofty\n      hills, rising occasionally into mountains, and covered with\n      vegetation in wild luxuriance, still shut in the scene.\n\n      Floating gently onward, but with a velocity slightly augmented,\n      the voyager, after many short turns, finds his progress\n      apparently barred by a gigantic gate or rather door of burnished\n      gold, elaborately carved and fretted, and reflecting the direct\n      rays of the now fast-sinking sun with an effulgence that seems to\n      wreath the whole surrounding forest in flames. This gate is\n      inserted in the lofty wall; which here appears to cross the river\n      at right angles. In a few moments, however, it is seen that the\n      main body of the water still sweeps in a gentle and extensive\n      curve to the left, the wall following it as before, while a\n      stream of considerable volume, diverging from the principal one,\n      makes its way, with a slight ripple, under the door, and is thus\n      hidden from sight. The canoe falls into the lesser channel and\n      approaches the gate. Its ponderous wings are slowly and musically\n      expanded. The boat glides between them, and commences a rapid\n      descent into a vast amphitheatre entirely begirt with purple\n      mountains, whose bases are laved by a gleaming river throughout\n      the full extent of their circuit. Meantime the whole Paradise of\n      Arnheim bursts upon the view. There is a gush of entrancing\n      melody; there is an oppressive sense of strange sweet odor;\u2014there\n      is a dream-like intermingling to the eye of tall slender Eastern\n      trees\u2014bosky shrubberies\u2014flocks of golden and crimson\n      birds\u2014lily-fringed lakes\u2014meadows of violets, tulips, poppies,\n      hyacinths, and tuberoses\u2014long intertangled lines of silver\n      streamlets\u2014and, upspringing confusedly from amid all, a mass of\n      semi-Gothic, semi-Saracenic architecture sustaining itself by\n      miracle in mid-air, glittering in the red sunlight with a hundred\n      oriels, minarets, and pinnacles; and seeming the phantom\n      handiwork, conjointly, of the Sylphs, of the Fairies, of the\n      Genii and of the Gnomes.\n\n\n\n\nLANDOR\u2019S COTTAGE\n\n\nA Pendant to \u201cThe Domain of Arnheim\u201d\n\n      During A pedestrian trip last summer, through one or two of the\n      river counties of New York, I found myself, as the day declined,\n      somewhat embarrassed about the road I was pursuing. The land\n      undulated very remarkably; and my path, for the last hour, had\n      wound about and about so confusedly, in its effort to keep in the\n      valleys, that I no longer knew in what direction lay the sweet\n      village of B\u2014\u2014, where I had determined to stop for the night. The\n      sun had scarcely shone\u2014strictly speaking\u2014during the day, which\n      nevertheless, had been unpleasantly warm. A smoky mist,\n      resembling that of the Indian summer, enveloped all things, and\n      of course, added to my uncertainty. Not that I cared much about\n      the matter. If I did not hit upon the village before sunset, or\n      even before dark, it was more than possible that a little Dutch\n      farmhouse, or something of that kind, would soon make its\n      appearance\u2014although, in fact, the neighborhood (perhaps on\n      account of being more picturesque than fertile) was very sparsely\n      inhabited. At all events, with my knapsack for a pillow, and my\n      hound as a sentry, a bivouac in the open air was just the thing\n      which would have amused me. I sauntered on, therefore, quite at\n      ease\u2014Ponto taking charge of my gun\u2014until at length, just as I had\n      begun to consider whether the numerous little glades that led\n      hither and thither, were intended to be paths at all, I was\n      conducted by one of them into an unquestionable carriage track.\n      There could be no mistaking it. The traces of light wheels were\n      evident; and although the tall shrubberies and overgrown\n      undergrowth met overhead, there was no obstruction whatever\n      below, even to the passage of a Virginian mountain wagon\u2014the most\n      aspiring vehicle, I take it, of its kind. The road, however,\n      except in being open through the wood\u2014if wood be not too weighty\n      a name for such an assemblage of light trees\u2014and except in the\n      particulars of evident wheel-tracks\u2014bore no resemblance to any\n      road I had before seen. The tracks of which I speak were but\n      faintly perceptible\u2014having been impressed upon the firm, yet\n      pleasantly moist surface of\u2014what looked more like green Genoese\n      velvet than any thing else. It was grass, clearly\u2014but grass such\n      as we seldom see out of England\u2014so short, so thick, so even, and\n      so vivid in color. Not a single impediment lay in the\n      wheel-route\u2014not even a chip or dead twig. The stones that once\n      obstructed the way had been carefully _placed_\u2014not thrown\u2014along\n      the sides of the lane, so as to define its boundaries at bottom\n      with a kind of half-precise, half-negligent, and wholly\n      picturesque definition. Clumps of wild flowers grew everywhere,\n      luxuriantly, in the interspaces.\n\n      What to make of all this, of course I knew not. Here was art\n      undoubtedly\u2014that did not surprise me\u2014all roads, in the ordinary\n      sense, are works of art; nor can I say that there was much to\n      wonder at in the mere excess of art manifested; all that seemed\n      to have been done, might have been done here\u2014with such natural\n      \u201ccapabilities\u201d (as they have it in the books on Landscape\n      Gardening)\u2014with very little labor and expense. No; it was not the\n      amount but the character of the art which caused me to take a\n      seat on one of the blossomy stones and gaze up and down this\n      fairy-like avenue for half an hour or more in bewildered\n      admiration. One thing became more and more evident the longer I\n      gazed: an artist, and one with a most scrupulous eye for form,\n      had superintended all these arrangements. The greatest care had\n      been taken to preserve a due medium between the neat and graceful\n      on the one hand, and the pittoresque, in the true sense of the\n      Italian term, on the other. There were few straight, and no long\n      uninterrupted lines. The same effect of curvature or of color\n      appeared twice, usually, but not oftener, at any one point of\n      view. Everywhere was variety in uniformity. It was a piece of\n      \u201ccomposition,\u201d in which the most fastidiously critical taste\n      could scarcely have suggested an emendation.\n\n      I had turned to the right as I entered this road, and now,\n      arising, I continued in the same direction. The path was so\n      serpentine, that at no moment could I trace its course for more\n      than two or three paces in advance. Its character did not undergo\n      any material change.\n\n      Presently the murmur of water fell gently upon my ear\u2014and in a\n      few moments afterward, as I turned with the road somewhat more\n      abruptly than hitherto, I became aware that a building of some\n      kind lay at the foot of a gentle declivity just before me. I\n      could see nothing distinctly on account of the mist which\n      occupied all the little valley below. A gentle breeze, however,\n      now arose, as the sun was about descending; and while I remained\n      standing on the brow of the slope, the fog gradually became\n      dissipated into wreaths, and so floated over the scene.\n\n      As it came fully into view\u2014thus gradually as I describe it\u2014piece\n      by piece, here a tree, there a glimpse of water, and here again\n      the summit of a chimney, I could scarcely help fancying that the\n      whole was one of the ingenious illusions sometimes exhibited\n      under the name of \u201cvanishing pictures.\u201d\n\n      By the time, however, that the fog had thoroughly disappeared,\n      the sun had made its way down behind the gentle hills, and\n      thence, as if with a slight chassez to the south, had come again\n      fully into sight, glaring with a purplish lustre through a chasm\n      that entered the valley from the west. Suddenly, therefore\u2014and as\n      if by the hand of magic\u2014this whole valley and every thing in it\n      became brilliantly visible.\n\n      The first _coup d\u2019\u0153il_, as the sun slid into the position\n      described, impressed me very much as I have been impressed, when\n      a boy, by the concluding scene of some well-arranged theatrical\n      spectacle or melodrama. Not even the monstrosity of color was\n      wanting; for the sunlight came out through the chasm, tinted all\n      orange and purple; while the vivid green of the grass in the\n      valley was reflected more or less upon all objects from the\n      curtain of vapor that still hung overhead, as if loth to take its\n      total departure from a scene so enchantingly beautiful.\n\n      The little vale into which I thus peered down from under the fog\n      canopy could not have been more than four hundred yards long;\n      while in breadth it varied from fifty to one hundred and fifty or\n      perhaps two hundred. It was most narrow at its northern\n      extremity, opening out as it tended southwardly, but with no very\n      precise regularity. The widest portion was within eighty yards of\n      the southern extreme. The slopes which encompassed the vale could\n      not fairly be called hills, unless at their northern face. Here a\n      precipitous ledge of granite arose to a height of some ninety\n      feet; and, as I have mentioned, the valley at this point was not\n      more than fifty feet wide; but as the visitor proceeded\n      southwardly from the cliff, he found on his right hand and on his\n      left, declivities at once less high, less precipitous, and less\n      rocky. All, in a word, sloped and softened to the south; and yet\n      the whole vale was engirdled by eminences, more or less high,\n      except at two points. One of these I have already spoken of. It\n      lay considerably to the north of west, and was where the setting\n      sun made its way, as I have before described, into the\n      amphitheatre, through a cleanly cut natural cleft in the granite\n      embankment; this fissure might have been ten yards wide at its\n      widest point, so far as the eye could trace it. It seemed to lead\n      up, up like a natural causeway, into the recesses of unexplored\n      mountains and forests. The other opening was directly at the\n      southern end of the vale. Here, generally, the slopes were\n      nothing more than gentle inclinations, extending from east to\n      west about one hundred and fifty yards. In the middle of this\n      extent was a depression, level with the ordinary floor of the\n      valley. As regards vegetation, as well as in respect to every\n      thing else, the scene softened and sloped to the south. To the\n      north\u2014on the craggy precipice\u2014a few paces from the verge\u2014up\n      sprang the magnificent trunks of numerous hickories, black\n      walnuts, and chestnuts, interspersed with occasional oak; and the\n      strong lateral branches thrown out by the walnuts especially,\n      spread far over the edge of the cliff. Proceeding southwardly,\n      the explorer saw, at first, the same class of trees, but less and\n      less lofty and Salvatorish in character; then he saw the gentler\n      elm, succeeded by the sassafras and locust\u2014these again by the\n      softer linden, red-bud, catalpa, and maple\u2014these yet again by\n      still more graceful and more modest varieties. The whole face of\n      the southern declivity was covered with wild shrubbery alone\u2014an\n      occasional silver willow or white poplar excepted. In the bottom\n      of the valley itself\u2014(for it must be borne in mind that the\n      vegetation hitherto mentioned grew only on the cliffs or\n      hillsides)\u2014were to be seen three insulated trees. One was an elm\n      of fine size and exquisite form: it stood guard over the southern\n      gate of the vale. Another was a hickory, much larger than the\n      elm, and altogether a much finer tree, although both were\n      exceedingly beautiful: it seemed to have taken charge of the\n      northwestern entrance, springing from a group of rocks in the\n      very jaws of the ravine, and throwing its graceful body, at an\n      angle of nearly forty-five degrees, far out into the sunshine of\n      the amphitheatre. About thirty yards east of this tree stood,\n      however, the pride of the valley, and beyond all question the\n      most magnificent tree I have ever seen, unless, perhaps, among\n      the cypresses of the Itchiatuckanee. It was a triple-stemmed\n      tulip-tree\u2014the Liriodendron Tulipiferum\u2014one of the natural order\n      of magnolias. Its three trunks separated from the parent at about\n      three feet from the soil, and diverging very slightly and\n      gradually, were not more than four feet apart at the point where\n      the largest stem shot out into foliage: this was at an elevation\n      of about eighty feet. The whole height of the principal division\n      was one hundred and twenty feet. Nothing can surpass in beauty\n      the form, or the glossy, vivid green of the leaves of the\n      tulip-tree. In the present instance they were fully eight inches\n      wide; but their glory was altogether eclipsed by the gorgeous\n      splendor of the profuse blossoms. Conceive, closely congregated,\n      a million of the largest and most resplendent tulips! Only thus\n      can the reader get any idea of the picture I would convey. And\n      then the stately grace of the clean, delicately-granulated\n      columnar stems, the largest four feet in diameter, at twenty from\n      the ground. The innumerable blossoms, mingling with those of\n      other trees scarcely less beautiful, although infinitely less\n      majestic, filled the valley with more than Arabian perfumes.\n\n      The general floor of the amphitheatre was grass of the same\n      character as that I had found in the road; if anything, more\n      deliciously soft, thick, velvety, and miraculously green. It was\n      hard to conceive how all this beauty had been attained.\n\n      I have spoken of two openings into the vale. From the one to the\n      northwest issued a rivulet, which came, gently murmuring and\n      slightly foaming, down the ravine, until it dashed against the\n      group of rocks out of which sprang the insulated hickory. Here,\n      after encircling the tree, it passed on a little to the north of\n      east, leaving the tulip tree some twenty feet to the south, and\n      making no decided alteration in its course until it came near the\n      midway between the eastern and western boundaries of the valley.\n      At this point, after a series of sweeps, it turned off at right\n      angles and pursued a generally southern direction meandering as\n      it went\u2014until it became lost in a small lake of irregular figure\n      (although roughly oval), that lay gleaming near the lower\n      extremity of the vale. This lakelet was, perhaps, a hundred yards\n      in diameter at its widest part. No crystal could be clearer than\n      its waters. Its bottom, which could be distinctly seen, consisted\n      altogether, of pebbles brilliantly white. Its banks, of the\n      emerald grass already described, rounded, rather than sloped, off\n      into the clear heaven below; and so clear was this heaven, so\n      perfectly, at times, did it reflect all objects above it, that\n      where the true bank ended and where the mimic one commenced, it\n      was a point of no little difficulty to determine. The trout, and\n      some other varieties of fish, with which this pond seemed to be\n      almost inconveniently crowded, had all the appearance of\n      veritable flying-fish. It was almost impossible to believe that\n      they were not absolutely suspended in the air. A light birch\n      canoe that lay placidly on the water, was reflected in its\n      minutest fibres with a fidelity unsurpassed by the most\n      exquisitely polished mirror. A small island, fairly laughing with\n      flowers in full bloom, and affording little more space than just\n      enough for a picturesque little building, seemingly a\n      fowl-house\u2014arose from the lake not far from its northern shore\u2014to\n      which it was connected by means of an inconceivably light-looking\n      and yet very primitive bridge. It was formed of a single, broad\n      and thick plank of the tulip wood. This was forty feet long, and\n      spanned the interval between shore and shore with a slight but\n      very perceptible arch, preventing all oscillation. From the\n      southern extreme of the lake issued a continuation of the\n      rivulet, which, after meandering for, perhaps, thirty yards,\n      finally passed through the \u201cdepression\u201d (already described) in\n      the middle of the southern declivity, and tumbling down a sheer\n      precipice of a hundred feet, made its devious and unnoticed way\n      to the Hudson.\n\n      The lake was deep\u2014at some points thirty feet\u2014but the rivulet\n      seldom exceeded three, while its greatest width was about eight.\n      Its bottom and banks were as those of the pond\u2014if a defect could\n      have been attributed, in point of picturesqueness, it was that of\n      excessive neatness.\n\n      The expanse of the green turf was relieved, here and there, by an\n      occasional showy shrub, such as the hydrangea, or the common\n      snowball, or the aromatic seringa; or, more frequently, by a\n      clump of geraniums blossoming gorgeously in great varieties.\n      These latter grew in pots which were carefully buried in the\n      soil, so as to give the plants the appearance of being\n      indigenous. Besides all this, the lawn\u2019s velvet was exquisitely\n      spotted with sheep\u2014a considerable flock of which roamed about the\n      vale, in company with three tamed deer, and a vast number of\n      brilliantly-plumed ducks. A very large mastiff seemed to be in\n      vigilant attendance upon these animals, each and all.\n\n      Along the eastern and western cliffs\u2014where, toward the upper\n      portion of the amphitheatre, the boundaries were more or less\n      precipitous\u2014grew ivy in great profusion\u2014so that only here and\n      there could even a glimpse of the naked rock be obtained. The\n      northern precipice, in like manner, was almost entirely clothed\n      by grape-vines of rare luxuriance; some springing from the soil\n      at the base of the cliff, and others from ledges on its face.\n\n      The slight elevation which formed the lower boundary of this\n      little domain, was crowned by a neat stone wall, of sufficient\n      height to prevent the escape of the deer. Nothing of the fence\n      kind was observable elsewhere; for nowhere else was an artificial\n      enclosure needed:\u2014any stray sheep, for example, which should\n      attempt to make its way out of the vale by means of the ravine,\n      would find its progress arrested, after a few yards\u2019 advance, by\n      the precipitous ledge of rock over which tumbled the cascade that\n      had arrested my attention as I first drew near the domain. In\n      short, the only ingress or egress was through a gate occupying a\n      rocky pass in the road, a few paces below the point at which I\n      stopped to reconnoitre the scene.\n\n      I have described the brook as meandering very irregularly through\n      the whole of its course. Its two general directions, as I have\n      said, were first from west to east, and then from north to south.\n      At the turn, the stream, sweeping backward, made an almost\n      circular loop, so as to form a peninsula which was very nearly an\n      island, and which included about the sixteenth of an acre. On\n      this peninsula stood a dwelling-house\u2014and when I say that this\n      house, like the infernal terrace seen by Vathek, \u201cetait d\u2019une\n      architecture inconnue dans les annales de la terre,\u201d I mean,\n      merely, that its tout ensemble struck me with the keenest sense\n      of combined novelty and propriety\u2014in a word, of poetry\u2014(for, than\n      in the words just employed, I could scarcely give, of poetry in\n      the abstract, a more rigorous definition)\u2014and I do not mean that\n      merely outre was perceptible in any respect.\n\n      In fact nothing could well be more simple\u2014more utterly\n      unpretending than this cottage. Its marvellous effect lay\n      altogether in its artistic arrangement as a picture. I could have\n      fancied, while I looked at it, that some eminent\n      landscape-painter had built it with his brush.\n\n      The point of view from which I first saw the valley, was not\n      altogether, although it was nearly, the best point from which to\n      survey the house. I will therefore describe it as I afterwards\n      saw it\u2014from a position on the stone wall at the southern extreme\n      of the amphitheatre.\n\n      The main building was about twenty-four feet long and sixteen\n      broad\u2014certainly not more. Its total height, from the ground to\n      the apex of the roof, could not have exceeded eighteen feet. To\n      the west end of this structure was attached one about a third\n      smaller in all its proportions:\u2014the line of its front standing\n      back about two yards from that of the larger house, and the line\n      of its roof, of course, being considerably depressed below that\n      of the roof adjoining. At right angles to these buildings, and\n      from the rear of the main one\u2014not exactly in the middle\u2014extended\n      a third compartment, very small\u2014being, in general, one-third less\n      than the western wing. The roofs of the two larger were very\n      steep\u2014sweeping down from the ridge-beam with a long concave\n      curve, and extending at least four feet beyond the walls in\n      front, so as to form the roofs of two piazzas. These latter\n      roofs, of course, needed no support; but as they had the air of\n      needing it, slight and perfectly plain pillars were inserted at\n      the corners alone. The roof of the northern wing was merely an\n      extension of a portion of the main roof. Between the chief\n      building and western wing arose a very tall and rather slender\n      square chimney of hard Dutch bricks, alternately black and red:\u2014a\n      slight cornice of projecting bricks at the top. Over the gables\n      the roofs also projected very much:\u2014in the main building about\n      four feet to the east and two to the west. The principal door was\n      not exactly in the main division, being a little to the\n      east\u2014while the two windows were to the west. These latter did not\n      extend to the floor, but were much longer and narrower than\n      usual\u2014they had single shutters like doors\u2014the panes were of\n      lozenge form, but quite large. The door itself had its upper half\n      of glass, also in lozenge panes\u2014a movable shutter secured it at\n      night. The door to the west wing was in its gable, and quite\n      simple\u2014a single window looked out to the south. There was no\n      external door to the north wing, and it also had only one window\n      to the east.\n\n      The blank wall of the eastern gable was relieved by stairs (with\n      a balustrade) running diagonally across it\u2014the ascent being from\n      the south. Under cover of the widely projecting eave these steps\n      gave access to a door leading to the garret, or rather loft\u2014for\n      it was lighted only by a single window to the north, and seemed\n      to have been intended as a store-room.\n\n      The piazzas of the main building and western wing had no floors,\n      as is usual; but at the doors and at each window, large, flat\n      irregular slabs of granite lay imbedded in the delicious turf,\n      affording comfortable footing in all weather. Excellent paths of\n      the same material\u2014not nicely adapted, but with the velvety sod\n      filling frequent intervals between the stones, led hither and\n      thither from the house, to a crystal spring about five paces off,\n      to the road, or to one or two out-houses that lay to the north,\n      beyond the brook, and were thoroughly concealed by a few locusts\n      and catalpas.\n\n      Not more than six steps from the main door of the cottage stood\n      the dead trunk of a fantastic pear-tree, so clothed from head to\n      foot in the gorgeous bignonia blossoms that one required no\n      little scrutiny to determine what manner of sweet thing it could\n      be. From various arms of this tree hung cages of different kinds.\n      In one, a large wicker cylinder with a ring at top, revelled a\n      mocking bird; in another an oriole; in a third the impudent\n      bobolink\u2014while three or four more delicate prisons were loudly\n      vocal with canaries.\n\n      The pillars of the piazza were enwreathed in jasmine and sweet\n      honeysuckle; while from the angle formed by the main structure\n      and its west wing, in front, sprang a grape-vine of unexampled\n      luxuriance. Scorning all restraint, it had clambered first to the\n      lower roof\u2014then to the higher; and along the ridge of this latter\n      it continued to writhe on, throwing out tendrils to the right and\n      left, until at length it fairly attained the east gable, and fell\n      trailing over the stairs.\n\n      The whole house, with its wings, was constructed of the\n      old-fashioned Dutch shingles\u2014broad, and with unrounded corners.\n      It is a peculiarity of this material to give houses built of it\n      the appearance of being wider at bottom than at top\u2014after the\n      manner of Egyptian architecture; and in the present instance,\n      this exceedingly picturesque effect was aided by numerous pots of\n      gorgeous flowers that almost encompassed the base of the\n      buildings.\n\n      The shingles were painted a dull gray; and the happiness with\n      which this neutral tint melted into the vivid green of the tulip\n      tree leaves that partially overshadowed the cottage, can readily\n      be conceived by an artist.\n\n      From the position near the stone wall, as described, the\n      buildings were seen at great advantage\u2014for the southeastern angle\n      was thrown forward\u2014so that the eye took in at once the whole of\n      the two fronts, with the picturesque eastern gable, and at the\n      same time obtained just a sufficient glimpse of the northern\n      wing, with parts of a pretty roof to the spring-house, and nearly\n      half of a light bridge that spanned the brook in the near\n      vicinity of the main buildings.\n\n      I did not remain very long on the brow of the hill, although long\n      enough to make a thorough survey of the scene at my feet. It was\n      clear that I had wandered from the road to the village, and I had\n      thus good traveller\u2019s excuse to open the gate before me, and\n      inquire my way, at all events; so, without more ado, I proceeded.\n\n      The road, after passing the gate, seemed to lie upon a natural\n      ledge, sloping gradually down along the face of the north-eastern\n      cliffs. It led me on to the foot of the northern precipice, and\n      thence over the bridge, round by the eastern gable to the front\n      door. In this progress, I took notice that no sight of the\n      out-houses could be obtained.\n\n      As I turned the corner of the gable, the mastiff bounded towards\n      me in stern silence, but with the eye and the whole air of a\n      tiger. I held him out my hand, however, in token of amity\u2014and I\n      never yet knew the dog who was proof against such an appeal to\n      his courtesy. He not only shut his mouth and wagged his tail, but\n      absolutely offered me his paw\u2014afterward extending his civilities\n      to Ponto.\n\n      As no bell was discernible, I rapped with my stick against the\n      door, which stood half open. Instantly a figure advanced to the\n      threshold\u2014that of a young woman about twenty-eight years of\n      age\u2014slender, or rather slight, and somewhat above the medium\n      height. As she approached, with a certain modest decision of step\n      altogether indescribable. I said to myself, \u201cSurely here I have\n      found the perfection of natural, in contradistinction from\n      artificial grace.\u201d The second impression which she made on me,\n      but by far the more vivid of the two, was that of enthusiasm. So\n      intense an expression of romance, perhaps I should call it, or of\n      unworldliness, as that which gleamed from her deep-set eyes, had\n      never so sunk into my heart of hearts before. I know not how it\n      is, but this peculiar expression of the eye, wreathing itself\n      occasionally into the lips, is the most powerful, if not\n      absolutely the sole spell, which rivets my interest in woman.\n      \u201cRomance,\u201d provided my readers fully comprehended what I would\n      here imply by the word\u2014\u201cromance\u201d and \u201cwomanliness\u201d seem to me\n      convertible terms: and, after all, what man truly loves in woman,\n      is simply her womanhood. The eyes of Annie (I heard some one from\n      the interior call her \u201cAnnie, darling!\u201d) were \u201cspiritual grey;\u201d\n      her hair, a light chestnut: this is all I had time to observe of\n      her.\n\n      At her most courteous of invitations, I entered\u2014passing first\n      into a tolerably wide vestibule. Having come mainly to observe, I\n      took notice that to my right as I stepped in, was a window, such\n      as those in front of the house; to the left, a door leading into\n      the principal room; while, opposite me, an open door enabled me\n      to see a small apartment, just the size of the vestibule,\n      arranged as a study, and having a large bow window looking out to\n      the north.\n\n      Passing into the parlor, I found myself with Mr. Landor\u2014for this,\n      I afterwards found, was his name. He was civil, even cordial in\n      his manner, but just then, I was more intent on observing the\n      arrangements of the dwelling which had so much interested me,\n      than the personal appearance of the tenant.\n\n      The north wing, I now saw, was a bed-chamber, its door opened\n      into the parlor. West of this door was a single window, looking\n      toward the brook. At the west end of the parlor, were a\n      fireplace, and a door leading into the west wing\u2014probably a\n      kitchen.\n\n      Nothing could be more rigorously simple than the furniture of the\n      parlor. On the floor was an ingrain carpet, of excellent\n      texture\u2014a white ground, spotted with small circular green\n      figures. At the windows were curtains of snowy white jaconet\n      muslin: they were tolerably full, and hung decisively, perhaps\n      rather formally in sharp, parallel plaits to the floor\u2014just to\n      the floor. The walls were prepared with a French paper of great\n      delicacy, a silver ground, with a faint green cord running\n      zig-zag throughout. Its expanse was relieved merely by three of\n      Julien\u2019s exquisite lithographs a trois crayons, fastened to the\n      wall without frames. One of these drawings was a scene of\n      Oriental luxury, or rather voluptuousness; another was a\n      \u201ccarnival piece,\u201d spirited beyond compare; the third was a Greek\n      female head\u2014a face so divinely beautiful, and yet of an\n      expression so provokingly indeterminate, never before arrested my\n      attention.\n\n      The more substantial furniture consisted of a round table, a few\n      chairs (including a large rocking-chair), and a sofa, or rather\n      \u201csettee;\u201d its material was plain maple painted a creamy white,\n      slightly interstriped with green; the seat of cane. The chairs\n      and table were \u201cto match,\u201d but the forms of all had evidently\n      been designed by the same brain which planned \u201cthe grounds;\u201d it\n      is impossible to conceive anything more graceful.\n\n      On the table were a few books; a large, square, crystal bottle of\n      some novel perfume; a plain ground glass _astral_ (not solar)\n      lamp with an Italian shade; and a large vase of\n      resplendently-blooming flowers. Flowers, indeed, of gorgeous\n      colours and delicate odour formed the sole mere decoration of the\n      apartment. The fire-place was nearly filled with a vase of\n      brilliant geranium. On a triangular shelf in each angle of the\n      room stood also a similar vase, varied only as to its lovely\n      contents. One or two smaller bouquets adorned the mantel, and\n      late violets clustered about the open windows.\n\n      It is not the purpose of this work to do more than give in\n      detail, a picture of Mr. Landor\u2019s residence\u2014as I found it. How he\n      made it what it was\u2014and why\u2014with some particulars of Mr. Landor\n      himself\u2014may, possibly form the subject of another article.\n\n\n\n\nWILLIAM WILSON\n\n\n    What say of it? what say of CONSCIENCE grim,\n    That spectre in my path?\n                    \u2014_Chamberlayne\u2019s Pharronida._\n\n      Let me call myself, for the present, William Wilson. The fair\n      page now lying before me need not be sullied with my real\n      appellation. This has been already too much an object for the\n      scorn\u2014for the horror\u2014for the detestation of my race. To the\n      uttermost regions of the globe have not the indignant winds\n      bruited its unparalleled infamy? Oh, outcast of all outcasts most\n      abandoned!\u2014to the earth art thou not forever dead? to its honors,\n      to its flowers, to its golden aspirations?\u2014and a cloud, dense,\n      dismal, and limitless, does it not hang eternally between thy\n      hopes and heaven?\n\n      I would not, if I could, here or to-day, embody a record of my\n      later years of unspeakable misery, and unpardonable crime. This\n      epoch\u2014these later years\u2014took unto themselves a sudden elevation\n      in turpitude, whose origin alone it is my present purpose to\n      assign. Men usually grow base by degrees. From me, in an instant,\n      all virtue dropped bodily as a mantle. From comparatively trivial\n      wickedness I passed, with the stride of a giant, into more than\n      the enormities of an Elah-Gabalus. What chance\u2014what one event\n      brought this evil thing to pass, bear with me while I relate.\n      Death approaches; and the shadow which foreruns him has thrown a\n      softening influence over my spirit. I long, in passing through\n      the dim valley, for the sympathy\u2014I had nearly said for the\n      pity\u2014of my fellow men. I would fain have them believe that I have\n      been, in some measure, the slave of circumstances beyond human\n      control. I would wish them to seek out for me, in the details I\n      am about to give, some little oasis of fatality amid a wilderness\n      of error. I would have them allow\u2014what they cannot refrain from\n      allowing\u2014that, although temptation may have erewhile existed as\n      great, man was never thus, at least, tempted before\u2014certainly,\n      never thus fell. And is it therefore that he has never thus\n      suffered? Have I not indeed been living in a dream? And am I not\n      now dying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the wildest\n      of all sublunary visions?\n\n      I am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily\n      excitable temperament has at all times rendered them remarkable;\n      and, in my earliest infancy, I gave evidence of having fully\n      inherited the family character. As I advanced in years it was\n      more strongly developed; becoming, for many reasons, a cause of\n      serious disquietude to my friends, and of positive injury to\n      myself. I grew self-willed, addicted to the wildest caprices, and\n      a prey to the most ungovernable passions. Weak-minded, and beset\n      with constitutional infirmities akin to my own, my parents could\n      do but little to check the evil propensities which distinguished\n      me. Some feeble and ill-directed efforts resulted in complete\n      failure on their part, and, of course, in total triumph on mine.\n      Thenceforward my voice was a household law; and at an age when\n      few children have abandoned their leading-strings, I was left to\n      the guidance of my own will, and became, in all but name, the\n      master of my own actions.\n\n      My earliest recollections of a school-life, are connected with a\n      large, rambling, Elizabethan house, in a misty-looking village of\n      England, where were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees,\n      and where all the houses were excessively ancient. In truth, it\n      was a dream-like and spirit-soothing place, that venerable old\n      town. At this moment, in fancy, I feel the refreshing chilliness\n      of its deeply-shadowed avenues, inhale the fragrance of its\n      thousand shrubberies, and thrill anew with undefinable delight,\n      at the deep hollow note of the church-bell, breaking, each hour,\n      with sullen and sudden roar, upon the stillness of the dusky\n      atmosphere in which the fretted Gothic steeple lay imbedded and\n      asleep.\n\n      It gives me, perhaps, as much of pleasure as I can now in any\n      manner experience, to dwell upon minute recollections of the\n      school and its concerns. Steeped in misery as I am\u2014misery, alas!\n      only too real\u2014I shall be pardoned for seeking relief, however\n      slight and temporary, in the weakness of a few rambling details.\n      These, moreover, utterly trivial, and even ridiculous in\n      themselves, assume, to my fancy, adventitious importance, as\n      connected with a period and a locality when and where I recognise\n      the first ambiguous monitions of the destiny which afterwards so\n      fully overshadowed me. Let me then remember.\n\n      The house, I have said, was old and irregular. The grounds were\n      extensive, and a high and solid brick wall, topped with a bed of\n      mortar and broken glass, encompassed the whole. This prison-like\n      rampart formed the limit of our domain; beyond it we saw but\n      thrice a week\u2014once every Saturday afternoon, when, attended by\n      two ushers, we were permitted to take brief walks in a body\n      through some of the neighbouring fields\u2014and twice during Sunday,\n      when we were paraded in the same formal manner to the morning and\n      evening service in the one church of the village. Of this church\n      the principal of our school was pastor. With how deep a spirit of\n      wonder and perplexity was I wont to regard him from our remote\n      pew in the gallery, as, with step solemn and slow, he ascended\n      the pulpit! This reverend man, with countenance so demurely\n      benign, with robes so glossy and so clerically flowing, with wig\n      so minutely powdered, so rigid and so vast,\u2014-could this be he\n      who, of late, with sour visage, and in snuffy habiliments,\n      administered, ferule in hand, the Draconian laws of the academy?\n      Oh, gigantic paradox, too utterly monstrous for solution!\n\n      At an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate.\n      It was riveted and studded with iron bolts, and surmounted with\n      jagged iron spikes. What impressions of deep awe did it inspire!\n      It was never opened save for the three periodical egressions and\n      ingressions already mentioned; then, in every creak of its mighty\n      hinges, we found a plenitude of mystery\u2014a world of matter for\n      solemn remark, or for more solemn meditation.\n\n      The extensive enclosure was irregular in form, having many\n      capacious recesses. Of these, three or four of the largest\n      constituted the play-ground. It was level, and covered with fine\n      hard gravel. I well remember it had no trees, nor benches, nor\n      anything similar within it. Of course it was in the rear of the\n      house. In front lay a small parterre, planted with box and other\n      shrubs, but through this sacred division we passed only upon rare\n      occasions indeed\u2014such as a first advent to school or final\n      departure thence, or perhaps, when a parent or friend having\n      called for us, we joyfully took our way home for the Christmas or\n      Midsummer holidays.\n\n      But the house!\u2014how quaint an old building was this!\u2014to me how\n      veritably a palace of enchantment! There was really no end to its\n      windings\u2014to its incomprehensible subdivisions. It was difficult,\n      at any given time, to say with certainty upon which of its two\n      stories one happened to be. From each room to every other there\n      were sure to be found three or four steps either in ascent or\n      descent. Then the lateral branches were\n      innumerable\u2014inconceivable\u2014and so returning in upon themselves,\n      that our most exact ideas in regard to the whole mansion were not\n      very far different from those with which we pondered upon\n      infinity. During the five years of my residence here, I was never\n      able to ascertain with precision, in what remote locality lay the\n      little sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or\n      twenty other scholars.\n\n      The school-room was the largest in the house\u2014I could not help\n      thinking, in the world. It was very long, narrow, and dismally\n      low, with pointed Gothic windows and a ceiling of oak. In a\n      remote and terror-inspiring angle was a square enclosure of eight\n      or ten feet, comprising the sanctum, \u201cduring hours,\u201d of our\n      principal, the Reverend Dr. Bransby. It was a solid structure,\n      with massy door, sooner than open which in the absence of the\n      \u201cDominie,\u201d we would all have willingly perished by the _peine\n      forte et dure_. In other angles were two other similar boxes, far\n      less reverenced, indeed, but still greatly matters of awe. One of\n      these was the pulpit of the \u201cclassical\u201d usher, one of the\n      \u201cEnglish and mathematical.\u201d Interspersed about the room, crossing\n      and recrossing in endless irregularity, were innumerable benches\n      and desks, black, ancient, and time-worn, piled desperately with\n      much-bethumbed books, and so beseamed with initial letters, names\n      at full length, grotesque figures, and other multiplied efforts\n      of the knife, as to have entirely lost what little of original\n      form might have been their portion in days long departed. A huge\n      bucket with water stood at one extremity of the room, and a clock\n      of stupendous dimensions at the other.\n\n      Encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy, I\n      passed, yet not in tedium or disgust, the years of the third\n      lustrum of my life. The teeming brain of childhood requires no\n      external world of incident to occupy or amuse it; and the\n      apparently dismal monotony of a school was replete with more\n      intense excitement than my riper youth has derived from luxury,\n      or my full manhood from crime. Yet I must believe that my first\n      mental development had in it much of the uncommon\u2014even much of\n      the _outr\u00e9_. Upon mankind at large the events of very early\n      existence rarely leave in mature age any definite impression. All\n      is gray shadow\u2014a weak and irregular remembrance\u2014an indistinct\n      regathering of feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric pains. With me\n      this is not so. In childhood I must have felt with the energy of\n      a man what I now find stamped upon memory in lines as vivid, as\n      deep, and as durable as the _exergues_ of the Carthaginian\n      medals.\n\n      Yet in fact\u2014in the fact of the world\u2019s view\u2014how little was there\n      to remember! The morning\u2019s awakening, the nightly summons to bed;\n      the connings, the recitations; the periodical half-holidays, and\n      perambulations; the play-ground, with its broils, its pastimes,\n      its intrigues;\u2014these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were\n      made to involve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich\n      incident, an universe of varied emotion, of excitement the most\n      passionate and spirit-stirring. \u201c_Oh, le bon temps, que ce si\u00e8cle\n      de fer!_\u201d\n\n      In truth, the ardor, the enthusiasm, and the imperiousness of my\n      disposition, soon rendered me a marked character among my\n      schoolmates, and by slow, but natural gradations, gave me an\n      ascendancy over all not greatly older than myself;\u2014over all with\n      a single exception. This exception was found in the person of a\n      scholar, who, although no relation, bore the same Christian and\n      surname as myself;\u2014a circumstance, in fact, little remarkable;\n      for, notwithstanding a noble descent, mine was one of those\n      everyday appellations which seem, by prescriptive right, to have\n      been, time out of mind, the common property of the mob. In this\n      narrative I have therefore designated myself as William Wilson,\u2014a\n      fictitious title not very dissimilar to the real. My namesake\n      alone, of those who in school phraseology constituted \u201cour set,\u201d\n      presumed to compete with me in the studies of the class\u2014in the\n      sports and broils of the play-ground\u2014to refuse implicit belief in\n      my assertions, and submission to my will\u2014indeed, to interfere\n      with my arbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever. If there\n      is on earth a supreme and unqualified despotism, it is the\n      despotism of a master-mind in boyhood over the less energetic\n      spirits of its companions.\n\n      Wilson\u2019s rebellion was to me a source of the greatest\n      embarrassment; the more so as, in spite of the bravado with which\n      in public I made a point of treating him and his pretensions, I\n      secretly felt that I feared him, and could not help thinking the\n      equality which he maintained so easily with myself, a proof of\n      his true superiority; since not to be overcome cost me a\n      perpetual struggle. Yet this superiority\u2014even this equality\u2014was\n      in truth acknowledged by no one but myself; our associates, by\n      some unaccountable blindness, seemed not even to suspect it.\n      Indeed, his competition, his resistance, and especially his\n      impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes, were not\n      more pointed than private. He appeared to be destitute alike of\n      the ambition which urged, and of the passionate energy of mind\n      which enabled me to excel. In his rivalry he might have been\n      supposed actuated solely by a whimsical desire to thwart,\n      astonish, or mortify myself; although there were times when I\n      could not help observing, with a feeling made up of wonder,\n      abasement, and pique, that he mingled with his injuries, his\n      insults, or his contradictions, a certain most inappropriate, and\n      assuredly most unwelcome affectionateness of manner. I could only\n      conceive this singular behavior to arise from a consummate\n      self-conceit assuming the vulgar airs of patronage and\n      protection.\n\n      Perhaps it was this latter trait in Wilson\u2019s conduct, conjoined\n      with our identity of name, and the mere accident of our having\n      entered the school upon the same day, which set afloat the notion\n      that we were brothers, among the senior classes in the academy.\n      These do not usually inquire with much strictness into the\n      affairs of their juniors. I have before said, or should have\n      said, that Wilson was not, in the most remote degree, connected\n      with my family. But assuredly if we had been brothers we must\n      have been twins; for, after leaving Dr. Bransby\u2019s, I casually\n      learned that my namesake was born on the nineteenth of January,\n      1813\u2014and this is a somewhat remarkable coincidence; for the day\n      is precisely that of my own nativity.\n\n      It may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety\n      occasioned me by the rivalry of Wilson, and his intolerable\n      spirit of contradiction, I could not bring myself to hate him\n      altogether. We had, to be sure, nearly every day a quarrel in\n      which, yielding me publicly the palm of victory, he, in some\n      manner, contrived to make me feel that it was he who had deserved\n      it; yet a sense of pride on my part, and a veritable dignity on\n      his own, kept us always upon what are called \u201cspeaking terms,\u201d\n      while there were many points of strong congeniality in our\n      tempers, operating to awake me in a sentiment which our position\n      alone, perhaps, prevented from ripening into friendship. It is\n      difficult, indeed, to define, or even to describe, my real\n      feelings towards him. They formed a motley and heterogeneous\n      admixture;\u2014some petulant animosity, which was not yet hatred,\n      some esteem, more respect, much fear, with a world of uneasy\n      curiosity. To the moralist it will be unnecessary to say, in\n      addition, that Wilson and myself were the most inseparable of\n      companions.\n\n      It was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between\n      us, which turned all my attacks upon him, (and they were many,\n      either open or covert) into the channel of banter or practical\n      joke (giving pain while assuming the aspect of mere fun) rather\n      than into a more serious and determined hostility. But my\n      endeavours on this head were by no means uniformly successful,\n      even when my plans were the most wittily concocted; for my\n      namesake had much about him, in character, of that unassuming and\n      quiet austerity which, while enjoying the poignancy of its own\n      jokes, has no heel of Achilles in itself, and absolutely refuses\n      to be laughed at. I could find, indeed, but one vulnerable point,\n      and that, lying in a personal peculiarity, arising, perhaps, from\n      constitutional disease, would have been spared by any antagonist\n      less at his wit\u2019s end than myself;\u2014my rival had a weakness in the\n      faucal or guttural organs, which precluded him from raising his\n      voice at any time above a very low whisper. Of this defect I did\n      not fail to take what poor advantage lay in my power.\n\n      Wilson\u2019s retaliations in kind were many; and there was one form\n      of his practical wit that disturbed me beyond measure. How his\n      sagacity first discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex\n      me, is a question I never could solve; but, having discovered, he\n      habitually practised the annoyance. I had always felt aversion to\n      my uncourtly patronymic, and its very common, if not plebeian\n      praenomen. The words were venom in my ears; and when, upon the\n      day of my arrival, a second William Wilson came also to the\n      academy, I felt angry with him for bearing the name, and doubly\n      disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it, who would be\n      the cause of its twofold repetition, who would be constantly in\n      my presence, and whose concerns, in the ordinary routine of the\n      school business, must inevitably, on account of the detestable\n      coincidence, be often confounded with my own.\n\n      The feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every\n      circumstance tending to show resemblance, moral or physical,\n      between my rival and myself. I had not then discovered the\n      remarkable fact that we were of the same age; but I saw that we\n      were of the same height, and I perceived that we were even\n      singularly alike in general contour of person and outline of\n      feature. I was galled, too, by the rumor touching a relationship,\n      which had grown current in the upper forms. In a word, nothing\n      could more seriously disturb me, (although I scrupulously\n      concealed such disturbance,) than any allusion to a similarity of\n      mind, person, or condition existing between us. But, in truth, I\n      had no reason to believe that (with the exception of the matter\n      of relationship, and in the case of Wilson himself,) this\n      similarity had ever been made a subject of comment, or even\n      observed at all by our schoolfellows. That he observed it in all\n      its bearings, and as fixedly as I, was apparent; but that he\n      could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of\n      annoyance, can only be attributed, as I said before, to his more\n      than ordinary penetration.\n\n      His cue, which was to perfect an imitation of myself, lay both in\n      words and in actions; and most admirably did he play his part. My\n      dress it was an easy matter to copy; my gait and general manner\n      were, without difficulty, appropriated; in spite of his\n      constitutional defect, even my voice did not escape him. My\n      louder tones were, of course, unattempted, but then the key\u2014it\n      was identical; _and his singular whisper, it grew the very echo\n      of my own_.\n\n      How greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me, (for it\n      could not justly be termed a caricature,) I will not now venture\n      to describe. I had but one consolation\u2014in the fact that the\n      imitation, apparently, was noticed by myself alone, and that I\n      had to endure only the knowing and strangely sarcastic smiles of\n      my namesake himself. Satisfied with having produced in my bosom\n      the intended effect, he seemed to chuckle in secret over the\n      sting he had inflicted, and was characteristically disregardful\n      of the public applause which the success of his witty endeavours\n      might have so easily elicited. That the school, indeed, did not\n      feel his design, perceive its accomplishment, and participate in\n      his sneer, was, for many anxious months, a riddle I could not\n      resolve. Perhaps the gradation of his copy rendered it not so\n      readily perceptible; or, more possibly, I owed my security to the\n      master air of the copyist, who, disdaining the letter, (which in\n      a painting is all the obtuse can see,) gave but the full spirit\n      of his original for my individual contemplation and chagrin.\n\n      I have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of\n      patronage which he assumed toward me, and of his frequent\n      officious interference with my will. This interference often took\n      the ungracious character of advice; advice not openly given, but\n      hinted or insinuated. I received it with a repugnance which\n      gained strength as I grew in years. Yet, at this distant day, let\n      me do him the simple justice to acknowledge that I can recall no\n      occasion when the suggestions of my rival were on the side of\n      those errors or follies so usual to his immature age and seeming\n      inexperience; that his moral sense, at least, if not his general\n      talents and worldly wisdom, was far keener than my own; and that\n      I might, to-day, have been a better, and thus a happier man, had\n      I less frequently rejected the counsels embodied in those meaning\n      whispers which I then but too cordially hated and too bitterly\n      despised.\n\n      As it was, I at length grew restive in the extreme under his\n      distasteful supervision, and daily resented more and more openly\n      what I considered his intolerable arrogance. I have said that, in\n      the first years of our connexion as schoolmates, my feelings in\n      regard to him might have been easily ripened into friendship;\n      but, in the latter months of my residence at the academy,\n      although the intrusion of his ordinary manner had, beyond doubt,\n      in some measure, abated, my sentiments, in nearly similar\n      proportion, partook very much of positive hatred. Upon one\n      occasion he saw this, I think, and afterwards avoided, or made a\n      show of avoiding me.\n\n      It was about the same period, if I remember aright, that, in an\n      altercation of violence with him, in which he was more than\n      usually thrown off his guard, and spoke and acted with an\n      openness of demeanor rather foreign to his nature, I discovered,\n      or fancied I discovered, in his accent, his air, and general\n      appearance, a something which first startled, and then deeply\n      interested me, by bringing to mind dim visions of my earliest\n      infancy\u2014wild, confused and thronging memories of a time when\n      memory herself was yet unborn. I cannot better describe the\n      sensation which oppressed me than by saying that I could with\n      difficulty shake off the belief of my having been acquainted with\n      the being who stood before me, at some epoch very long ago\u2014some\n      point of the past even infinitely remote. The delusion, however,\n      faded rapidly as it came; and I mention it at all but to define\n      the day of the last conversation I there held with my singular\n      namesake.\n\n      The huge old house, with its countless subdivisions, had several\n      large chambers communicating with each other, where slept the\n      greater number of the students. There were, however, (as must\n      necessarily happen in a building so awkwardly planned,) many\n      little nooks or recesses, the odds and ends of the structure; and\n      these the economic ingenuity of Dr. Bransby had also fitted up as\n      dormitories; although, being the merest closets, they were\n      capable of accommodating but a single individual. One of these\n      small apartments was occupied by Wilson.\n\n      One night, about the close of my fifth year at the school, and\n      immediately after the altercation just mentioned, finding every\n      one wrapped in sleep, I arose from bed, and, lamp in hand, stole\n      through a wilderness of narrow passages from my own bedroom to\n      that of my rival. I had long been plotting one of those\n      ill-natured pieces of practical wit at his expense in which I had\n      hitherto been so uniformly unsuccessful. It was my intention,\n      now, to put my scheme in operation, and I resolved to make him\n      feel the whole extent of the malice with which I was imbued.\n      Having reached his closet, I noiselessly entered, leaving the\n      lamp, with a shade over it, on the outside. I advanced a step,\n      and listened to the sound of his tranquil breathing. Assured of\n      his being asleep, I returned, took the light, and with it again\n      approached the bed. Close curtains were around it, which, in the\n      prosecution of my plan, I slowly and quietly withdrew, when the\n      bright rays fell vividly upon the sleeper, and my eyes, at the\n      same moment, upon his countenance. I looked;\u2014and a numbness, an\n      iciness of feeling instantly pervaded my frame. My breast heaved,\n      my knees tottered, my whole spirit became possessed with an\n      objectless yet intolerable horror. Gasping for breath, I lowered\n      the lamp in still nearer proximity to the face. Were these\u2014these\n      the lineaments of William Wilson? I saw, indeed, that they were\n      his, but I shook as if with a fit of the ague in fancying they\n      were not. What was there about them to confound me in this\n      manner? I gazed;\u2014while my brain reeled with a multitude of\n      incoherent thoughts. Not thus he appeared\u2014assuredly not thus\u2014in\n      the vivacity of his waking hours. The same name! the same contour\n      of person! the same day of arrival at the academy! And then his\n      dogged and meaningless imitation of my gait, my voice, my habits,\n      and my manner! Was it, in truth, within the bounds of human\n      possibility, that what I now saw was the result, merely, of the\n      habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation? Awe-stricken, and\n      with a creeping shudder, I extinguished the lamp, passed silently\n      from the chamber, and left, at once, the halls of that old\n      academy, never to enter them again.\n\n      After a lapse of some months, spent at home in mere idleness, I\n      found myself a student at Eton. The brief interval had been\n      sufficient to enfeeble my remembrance of the events at Dr.\n      Bransby\u2019s, or at least to effect a material change in the nature\n      of the feelings with which I remembered them. The truth\u2014the\n      tragedy\u2014of the drama was no more. I could now find room to doubt\n      the evidence of my senses; and seldom called up the subject at\n      all but with wonder at extent of human credulity, and a smile at\n      the vivid force of the imagination which I hereditarily\n      possessed. Neither was this species of scepticism likely to be\n      diminished by the character of the life I led at Eton. The vortex\n      of thoughtless folly into which I there so immediately and so\n      recklessly plunged, washed away all but the froth of my past\n      hours, engulfed at once every solid or serious impression, and\n      left to memory only the veriest levities of a former existence.\n\n      I do not wish, however, to trace the course of my miserable\n      profligacy here\u2014a profligacy which set at defiance the laws,\n      while it eluded the vigilance of the institution. Three years of\n      folly, passed without profit, had but given me rooted habits of\n      vice, and added, in a somewhat unusual degree, to my bodily\n      stature, when, after a week of soulless dissipation, I invited a\n      small party of the most dissolute students to a secret carousal\n      in my chambers. We met at a late hour of the night; for our\n      debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until morning. The\n      wine flowed freely, and there were not wanting other and perhaps\n      more dangerous seductions; so that the gray dawn had already\n      faintly appeared in the east, while our delirious extravagance\n      was at its height. Madly flushed with cards and intoxication, I\n      was in the act of insisting upon a toast of more than wonted\n      profanity, when my attention was suddenly diverted by the\n      violent, although partial unclosing of the door of the apartment,\n      and by the eager voice of a servant from without. He said that\n      some person, apparently in great haste, demanded to speak with me\n      in the hall.\n\n      Wildly excited with wine, the unexpected interruption rather\n      delighted than surprised me. I staggered forward at once, and a\n      few steps brought me to the vestibule of the building. In this\n      low and small room there hung no lamp; and now no light at all\n      was admitted, save that of the exceedingly feeble dawn which made\n      its way through the semi-circular window. As I put my foot over\n      the threshold, I became aware of the figure of a youth about my\n      own height, and habited in a white kerseymere morning frock, cut\n      in the novel fashion of the one I myself wore at the moment. This\n      the faint light enabled me to perceive; but the features of his\n      face I could not distinguish. Upon my entering he strode\n      hurriedly up to me, and, seizing me by the arm with a gesture of\n      petulant impatience, whispered the words \u201cWilliam Wilson!\u201d in my\n      ear.\n\n      I grew perfectly sober in an instant.\n\n      There was that in the manner of the stranger, and in the\n      tremulous shake of his uplifted finger, as he held it between my\n      eyes and the light, which filled me with unqualified amazement;\n      but it was not this which had so violently moved me. It was the\n      pregnancy of solemn admonition in the singular, low, hissing\n      utterance; and, above all, it was the character, the tone, the\n      key, of those few, simple, and familiar, yet whispered syllables,\n      which came with a thousand thronging memories of bygone days, and\n      struck upon my soul with the shock of a galvanic battery. Ere I\n      could recover the use of my senses he was gone.\n\n      Although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my\n      disordered imagination, yet was it evanescent as vivid. For some\n      weeks, indeed, I busied myself in earnest inquiry, or was wrapped\n      in a cloud of morbid speculation. I did not pretend to disguise\n      from my perception the identity of the singular individual who\n      thus perseveringly interfered with my affairs, and harassed me\n      with his insinuated counsel. But who and what was this\n      Wilson?\u2014and whence came he?\u2014and what were his purposes? Upon\n      neither of these points could I be satisfied; merely\n      ascertaining, in regard to him, that a sudden accident in his\n      family had caused his removal from Dr. Bransby\u2019s academy on the\n      afternoon of the day in which I myself had eloped. But in a brief\n      period I ceased to think upon the subject; my attention being all\n      absorbed in a contemplated departure for Oxford. Thither I soon\n      went; the uncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me with\n      an outfit and annual establishment, which would enable me to\n      indulge at will in the luxury already so dear to my heart,\u2014to vie\n      in profuseness of expenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the\n      wealthiest earldoms in Great Britain.\n\n      Excited by such appliances to vice, my constitutional temperament\n      broke forth with redoubled ardor, and I spurned even the common\n      restraints of decency in the mad infatuation of my revels. But it\n      were absurd to pause in the detail of my extravagance. Let it\n      suffice, that among spendthrifts I out-Heroded Herod, and that,\n      giving name to a multitude of novel follies, I added no brief\n      appendix to the long catalogue of vices then usual in the most\n      dissolute university of Europe.\n\n      It could hardly be credited, however, that I had, even here, so\n      utterly fallen from the gentlemanly estate, as to seek\n      acquaintance with the vilest arts of the gambler by profession,\n      and, having become an adept in his despicable science, to\n      practise it habitually as a means of increasing my already\n      enormous income at the expense of the weak-minded among my\n      fellow-collegians. Such, nevertheless, was the fact. And the very\n      enormity of this offence against all manly and honourable\n      sentiment proved, beyond doubt, the main if not the sole reason\n      of the impunity with which it was committed. Who, indeed, among\n      my most abandoned associates, would not rather have disputed the\n      clearest evidence of his senses, than have suspected of such\n      courses, the gay, the frank, the generous William Wilson\u2014the\n      noblest and most liberal commoner at Oxford\u2014him whose follies\n      (said his parasites) were but the follies of youth and unbridled\n      fancy\u2014whose errors but inimitable whim\u2014whose darkest vice but a\n      careless and dashing extravagance?\n\n      I had been now two years successfully busied in this way, when\n      there came to the university a young parvenu nobleman,\n      Glendinning\u2014rich, said report, as Herodes Atticus\u2014his riches,\n      too, as easily acquired. I soon found him of weak intellect, and,\n      of course, marked him as a fitting subject for my skill. I\n      frequently engaged him in play, and contrived, with the gambler\u2019s\n      usual art, to let him win considerable sums, the more effectually\n      to entangle him in my snares. At length, my schemes being ripe, I\n      met him (with the full intention that this meeting should be\n      final and decisive) at the chambers of a fellow-commoner, (Mr.\n      Preston,) equally intimate with both, but who, to do him justice,\n      entertained not even a remote suspicion of my design. To give to\n      this a better coloring, I had contrived to have assembled a party\n      of some eight or ten, and was solicitously careful that the\n      introduction of cards should appear accidental, and originate in\n      the proposal of my contemplated dupe himself. To be brief upon a\n      vile topic, none of the low finesse was omitted, so customary\n      upon similar occasions that it is a just matter for wonder how\n      any are still found so besotted as to fall its victim.\n\n      We had protracted our sitting far into the night, and I had at\n      length effected the manoeuvre of getting Glendinning as my sole\n      antagonist. The game, too, was my favorite _\u00e9cart\u00e9!_ The rest of\n      the company, interested in the extent of our play, had abandoned\n      their own cards, and were standing around us as spectators. The\n      _parvenu_, who had been induced by my artifices in the early part\n      of the evening, to drink deeply, now shuffled, dealt, or played,\n      with a wild nervousness of manner for which his intoxication, I\n      thought, might partially, but could not altogether account. In a\n      very short period he had become my debtor to a large amount,\n      when, having taken a long draught of port, he did precisely what\n      I had been coolly anticipating\u2014he proposed to double our already\n      extravagant stakes. With a well-feigned show of reluctance, and\n      not until after my repeated refusal had seduced him into some\n      angry words which gave a color of pique to my compliance, did I\n      finally comply. The result, of course, did but prove how entirely\n      the prey was in my toils: in less than an hour he had quadrupled\n      his debt. For some time his countenance had been losing the\n      florid tinge lent it by the wine; but now, to my astonishment, I\n      perceived that it had grown to a pallor truly fearful. I say to\n      my astonishment. Glendinning had been represented to my eager\n      inquiries as immeasurably wealthy; and the sums which he had as\n      yet lost, although in themselves vast, could not, I supposed,\n      very seriously annoy, much less so violently affect him. That he\n      was overcome by the wine just swallowed, was the idea which most\n      readily presented itself; and, rather with a view to the\n      preservation of my own character in the eyes of my associates,\n      than from any less interested motive, I was about to insist,\n      peremptorily, upon a discontinuance of the play, when some\n      expressions at my elbow from among the company, and an\n      ejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of Glendinning,\n      gave me to understand that I had effected his total ruin under\n      circumstances which, rendering him an object for the pity of all,\n      should have protected him from the ill offices even of a fiend.\n\n      What now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say. The\n      pitiable condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed\n      gloom over all; and, for some moments, a profound silence was\n      maintained, during which I could not help feeling my cheeks\n      tingle with the many burning glances of scorn or reproach cast\n      upon me by the less abandoned of the party. I will even own that\n      an intolerable weight of anxiety was for a brief instant lifted\n      from my bosom by the sudden and extraordinary interruption which\n      ensued. The wide, heavy folding doors of the apartment were all\n      at once thrown open, to their full extent, with a vigorous and\n      rushing impetuosity that extinguished, as if by magic, every\n      candle in the room. Their light, in dying, enabled us just to\n      perceive that a stranger had entered, about my own height, and\n      closely muffled in a cloak. The darkness, however, was now total;\n      and we could only feel that he was standing in our midst. Before\n      any one of us could recover from the extreme astonishment into\n      which this rudeness had thrown all, we heard the voice of the\n      intruder.\n\n      \u201cGentlemen,\u201d he said, in a low, distinct, and\n      never-to-be-forgotten whisper which thrilled to the very marrow\n      of my bones, \u201cGentlemen, I make no apology for this behaviour,\n      because in thus behaving, I am but fulfilling a duty. You are,\n      beyond doubt, uninformed of the true character of the person who\n      has to-night won at _\u00e9cart\u00e9_ a large sum of money from Lord\n      Glendinning. I will therefore put you upon an expeditious and\n      decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary information.\n      Please to examine, at your leisure, the inner linings of the cuff\n      of his left sleeve, and the several little packages which may be\n      found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered\n      morning wrapper.\u201d\n\n      While he spoke, so profound was the stillness that one might have\n      heard a pin drop upon the floor. In ceasing, he departed at once,\n      and as abruptly as he had entered. Can I\u2014shall I describe my\n      sensations? Must I say that I felt all the horrors of the damned?\n      Most assuredly I had little time given for reflection. Many hands\n      roughly seized me upon the spot, and lights were immediately\n      reprocured. A search ensued. In the lining of my sleeve were\n      found all the court cards essential in _\u00e9cart\u00e9_, and, in the\n      pockets of my wrapper, a number of packs, facsimiles of those\n      used at our sittings, with the single exception that mine were of\n      the species called, technically, arrondees; the honours being\n      slightly convex at the ends, the lower cards slightly convex at\n      the sides. In this disposition, the dupe who cuts, as customary,\n      at the length of the pack, will invariably find that he cuts his\n      antagonist an honor; while the gambler, cutting at the breadth,\n      will, as certainly, cut nothing for his victim which may count in\n      the records of the game.\n\n      Any burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected\n      me less than the silent contempt, or the sarcastic composure,\n      with which it was received.\n\n      \u201cMr. Wilson,\u201d said our host, stooping to remove from beneath his\n      feet an exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs, \u201cMr. Wilson,\n      this is your property.\u201d (The weather was cold; and, upon quitting\n      my own room, I had thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper,\n      putting it off upon reaching the scene of play.) \u201cI presume it is\n      supererogatory to seek here (eyeing the folds of the garment with\n      a bitter smile) for any farther evidence of your skill. Indeed,\n      we have had enough. You will see the necessity, I hope, of\n      quitting Oxford\u2014at all events, of quitting instantly my\n      chambers.\u201d\n\n      Abased, humbled to the dust as I then was, it is probable that I\n      should have resented this galling language by immediate personal\n      violence, had not my whole attention been at the moment arrested\n      by a fact of the most startling character. The cloak which I had\n      worn was of a rare description of fur; how rare, how\n      extravagantly costly, I shall not venture to say. Its fashion,\n      too, was of my own fantastic invention; for I was fastidious to\n      an absurd degree of coxcombry, in matters of this frivolous\n      nature. When, therefore, Mr. Preston reached me that which he had\n      picked up upon the floor, and near the folding doors of the\n      apartment, it was with an astonishment nearly bordering upon\n      terror, that I perceived my own already hanging on my arm, (where\n      I had no doubt unwittingly placed it,) and that the one presented\n      me was but its exact counterpart in every, in even the minutest\n      possible particular. The singular being who had so disastrously\n      exposed me, had been muffled, I remembered, in a cloak; and none\n      had been worn at all by any of the members of our party with the\n      exception of myself. Retaining some presence of mind, I took the\n      one offered me by Preston; placed it, unnoticed, over my own;\n      left the apartment with a resolute scowl of defiance; and, next\n      morning ere dawn of day, commenced a hurried journey from Oxford\n      to the continent, in a perfect agony of horror and of shame.\n\n      I fled in vain. My evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation,\n      and proved, indeed, that the exercise of its mysterious dominion\n      had as yet only begun. Scarcely had I set foot in Paris ere I had\n      fresh evidence of the detestable interest taken by this Wilson in\n      my concerns. Years flew, while I experienced no relief.\n      Villain!\u2014at Rome, with how untimely, yet with how spectral an\n      officiousness, stepped he in between me and my ambition! At\n      Vienna, too\u2014at Berlin\u2014and at Moscow! Where, in truth, had I not\n      bitter cause to curse him within my heart? From his inscrutable\n      tyranny did I at length flee, panic-stricken, as from a\n      pestilence; and to the very ends of the earth I fled in vain.\n\n      And again, and again, in secret communion with my own spirit,\n      would I demand the questions \u201cWho is he?\u2014whence came he?\u2014and what\n      are his objects?\u201d But no answer was there found. And then I\n      scrutinized, with a minute scrutiny, the forms, and the methods,\n      and the leading traits of his impertinent supervision. But even\n      here there was very little upon which to base a conjecture. It\n      was noticeable, indeed, that, in no one of the multiplied\n      instances in which he had of late crossed my path, had he so\n      crossed it except to frustrate those schemes, or to disturb those\n      actions, which, if fully carried out, might have resulted in\n      bitter mischief. Poor justification this, in truth, for an\n      authority so imperiously assumed! Poor indemnity for natural\n      rights of self-agency so pertinaciously, so insultingly denied!\n\n      I had also been forced to notice that my tormentor, for a very\n      long period of time, (while scrupulously and with miraculous\n      dexterity maintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with\n      myself,) had so contrived it, in the execution of his varied\n      interference with my will, that I saw not, at any moment, the\n      features of his face. Be Wilson what he might, this, at least,\n      was but the veriest of affectation, or of folly. Could he, for an\n      instant, have supposed that, in my admonisher at Eton\u2014in the\n      destroyer of my honor at Oxford,\u2014in him who thwarted my ambition\n      at Rome, my revenge at Paris, my passionate love at Naples, or\n      what he falsely termed my avarice in Egypt,\u2014that in this, my\n      arch-enemy and evil genius, could fail to recognise the William\n      Wilson of my school boy days,\u2014the namesake, the companion, the\n      rival,\u2014the hated and dreaded rival at Dr. Bransby\u2019s?\n      Impossible!\u2014But let me hasten to the last eventful scene of the\n      drama.\n\n      Thus far I had succumbed supinely to this imperious domination.\n      The sentiment of deep awe with which I habitually regarded the\n      elevated character, the majestic wisdom, the apparent\n      omnipresence and omnipotence of Wilson, added to a feeling of\n      even terror, with which certain other traits in his nature and\n      assumptions inspired me, had operated, hitherto, to impress me\n      with an idea of my own utter weakness and helplessness, and to\n      suggest an implicit, although bitterly reluctant submission to\n      his arbitrary will. But, of late days, I had given myself up\n      entirely to wine; and its maddening influence upon my hereditary\n      temper rendered me more and more impatient of control. I began to\n      murmur,\u2014to hesitate,\u2014to resist. And was it only fancy which\n      induced me to believe that, with the increase of my own firmness,\n      that of my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution? Be this\n      as it may, I now began to feel the inspiration of a burning hope,\n      and at length nurtured in my secret thoughts a stern and\n      desperate resolution that I would submit no longer to be\n      enslaved.\n\n      It was at Rome, during the Carnival of 18\u2014, that I attended a\n      masquerade in the palazzo of the Neapolitan Duke Di Broglio. I\n      had indulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the\n      wine-table; and now the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded\n      rooms irritated me beyond endurance. The difficulty, too, of\n      forcing my way through the mazes of the company contributed not a\n      little to the ruffling of my temper; for I was anxiously seeking,\n      (let me not say with what unworthy motive) the young, the gay,\n      the beautiful wife of the aged and doting Di Broglio. With a too\n      unscrupulous confidence she had previously communicated to me the\n      secret of the costume in which she would be habited, and now,\n      having caught a glimpse of her person, I was hurrying to make my\n      way into her presence. At this moment I felt a light hand placed\n      upon my shoulder, and that ever-remembered, low, damnable\n      _whisper_ within my ear.\n\n      In an absolute phrenzy of wrath, I turned at once upon him who\n      had thus interrupted me, and seized him violently by the collar.\n      He was attired, as I had expected, in a costume altogether\n      similar to my own; wearing a Spanish cloak of blue velvet, begirt\n      about the waist with a crimson belt sustaining a rapier. A mask\n      of black silk entirely covered his face.\n\n      \u201cScoundrel!\u201d I said, in a voice husky with rage, while every\n      syllable I uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury, \u201cscoundrel!\n      impostor! accursed villain! you shall not\u2014you shall not dog me\n      unto death! Follow me, or I stab you where you stand!\u201d\u2014and I\n      broke my way from the ball-room into a small ante-chamber\n      adjoining, dragging him unresistingly with me as I went.\n\n      Upon entering, I thrust him furiously from me. He staggered\n      against the wall, while I closed the door with an oath, and\n      commanded him to draw. He hesitated but for an instant; then,\n      with a slight sigh, drew in silence, and put himself upon his\n      defence.\n\n      The contest was brief indeed. I was frantic with every species of\n      wild excitement, and felt within my single arm the energy and\n      power of a multitude. In a few seconds I forced him by sheer\n      strength against the wainscoting, and thus, getting him at mercy,\n      plunged my sword, with brute ferocity, repeatedly through and\n      through his bosom.\n\n      At that instant some person tried the latch of the door. I\n      hastened to prevent an intrusion, and then immediately returned\n      to my dying antagonist. But what human language can adequately\n      portray that astonishment, that horror which possessed me at the\n      spectacle then presented to view? The brief moment in which I\n      averted my eyes had been sufficient to produce, apparently, a\n      material change in the arrangements at the upper or farther end\n      of the room. A large mirror,\u2014so at first it seemed to me in my\n      confusion\u2014now stood where none had been perceptible before; and,\n      as I stepped up to it in extremity of terror, mine own image, but\n      with features all pale and dabbled in blood, advanced to meet me\n      with a feeble and tottering gait.\n\n      Thus it appeared, I say, but was not. It was my antagonist\u2014it was\n      Wilson, who then stood before me in the agonies of his\n      dissolution. His mask and cloak lay, where he had thrown them,\n      upon the floor. Not a thread in all his raiment\u2014not a line in all\n      the marked and singular lineaments of his face which was not,\n      even in the most absolute identity, mine own!\n\n      It was Wilson; but he spoke no longer in a whisper, and I could\n      have fancied that I myself was speaking while he said:\n\n      _\u201cYou have conquered, and I yield. Yet, henceforward art thou\n      also dead\u2014dead to the World, to Heaven and to Hope! In me didst\n      thou exist\u2014and, in my death, see by this image, which is thine\n      own, how utterly thou hast murdered thyself.\u201d_\n\n\n\n\nTHE TELL-TALE HEART.\n\n\n      True!\u2014nervous\u2014very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am;\n      but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my\n      senses\u2014not destroyed\u2014not dulled them. Above all was the sense of\n      hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth.\n      I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and\n      observe how healthily\u2014how calmly I can tell you the whole story.\n\n      It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but\n      once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was\n      none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never\n      wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no\n      desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! He had the eye\n      of a vulture\u2014a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it\n      fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees\u2014very\n      gradually\u2014I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and\n      thus rid myself of the eye forever.\n\n      Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But\n      you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I\n      proceeded\u2014with what caution\u2014with what foresight\u2014with what\n      dissimulation I went to work! I was never kinder to the old man\n      than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night,\n      about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it\u2014oh,\n      so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my\n      head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light\n      shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have\n      laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it\n      slowly\u2014very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old\n      man\u2019s sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the\n      opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed.\n      Ha!\u2014would a madman have been so wise as this? And then, when my\n      head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously\u2014oh, so\n      cautiously\u2014cautiously (for the hinges creaked)\u2014I undid it just so\n      much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I\n      did for seven long nights\u2014every night just at midnight\u2014but I\n      found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the\n      work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye.\n      And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the\n      chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a\n      hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you\n      see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to\n      suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him\n      while he slept.\n\n      Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening\n      the door. A watch\u2019s minute hand moves more quickly than did mine.\n      Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers\u2014of\n      my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To\n      think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and\n      he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly\n      chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on\n      the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I drew\n      back\u2014but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick\n      darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of\n      robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the\n      door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.\n\n      I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my\n      thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up\n      in bed, crying out\u2014\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d\n\n      I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not\n      move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down.\n      He was still sitting up in the bed listening;\u2014just as I have\n      done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the\n      wall.\n\n      Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of\n      mortal terror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief\u2014oh, no!\u2014it\n      was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul\n      when overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night,\n      just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from\n      my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that\n      distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man\n      felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that\n      he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when\n      he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing\n      upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could\n      not. He had been saying to himself\u2014\u201cIt is nothing but the wind in\n      the chimney\u2014it is only a mouse crossing the floor,\u201d or \u201cIt is\n      merely a cricket which has made a single chirp.\u201d Yes, he had been\n      trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had\n      found all in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching him\n      had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the\n      victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived\n      shadow that caused him to feel\u2014although he neither saw nor\n      heard\u2014to feel the presence of my head within the room.\n\n      When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing\n      him lie down, I resolved to open a little\u2014a very, very little\n      crevice in the lantern. So I opened it\u2014you cannot imagine how\n      stealthily, stealthily\u2014until, at length a simple dim ray, like\n      the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full\n      upon the vulture eye.\n\n      It was open\u2014wide, wide open\u2014and I grew furious as I gazed upon\n      it. I saw it with perfect distinctness\u2014all a dull blue, with a\n      hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones;\n      but I could see nothing else of the old man\u2019s face or person: for\n      I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the\n      damned spot.\n\n      And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but\n      over-acuteness of the sense?\u2014now, I say, there came to my ears a\n      low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in\n      cotton. I knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the\n      old man\u2019s heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum\n      stimulates the soldier into courage.\n\n      But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I\n      held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could\n      maintain the ray upon the eye. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the\n      heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and\n      louder every instant. The old man\u2019s terror must have been\n      extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment!\u2014do you mark\n      me well? I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at\n      the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old\n      house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable\n      terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still.\n      But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must\n      burst. And now a new anxiety seized me\u2014the sound would be heard\n      by a neighbour! The old man\u2019s hour had come! With a loud yell, I\n      threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked\n      once\u2014once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and\n      pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the\n      deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a\n      muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be\n      heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was\n      dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was\n      stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it\n      there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead.\n      His eye would trouble me no more.\n\n      If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I\n      describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the\n      body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence.\n      First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the\n      arms and the legs.\n\n      I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and\n      deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards\n      so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye\u2014not even his\u2014could\n      have detected any thing wrong. There was nothing to wash out\u2014no\n      stain of any kind\u2014no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for\n      that. A tub had caught all\u2014ha! ha!\n\n      When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o\u2019clock\u2014still\n      dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a\n      knocking at the street door. I went down to open it with a light\n      heart,\u2014for what had I now to fear? There entered three men, who\n      introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the\n      police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night;\n      suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been\n      lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been\n      deputed to search the premises.\n\n      I smiled,\u2014for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome.\n      The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I\n      mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my visitors all over\n      the house. I bade them search\u2014search well. I led them, at length,\n      to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed.\n      In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the\n      room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I\n      myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own\n      seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the\n      victim.\n\n      The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was\n      singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they\n      chatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting\n      pale and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing\n      in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted. The ringing\n      became more distinct:\u2014it continued and became more distinct: I\n      talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued\n      and gained definiteness\u2014until, at length, I found that the noise\n      was not within my ears.\n\n      No doubt I now grew _very_ pale;\u2014but I talked more fluently, and\n      with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased\u2014and what could I\n      do? It was a low, dull, quick sound\u2014much such a sound as a watch\n      makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath\u2014and yet the\n      officers heard it not. I talked more quickly\u2014more vehemently; but\n      the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles,\n      in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise\n      steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor\n      to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the\n      observations of the men\u2014but the noise steadily increased. Oh God!\n      what could I do? I foamed\u2014I raved\u2014I swore! I swung the chair upon\n      which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the\n      noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew\n      louder\u2014louder\u2014louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and\n      smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God!\u2014no, no!\n      They heard!\u2014they suspected!\u2014they knew!\u2014they were making a mockery\n      of my horror!\u2014this I thought, and this I think. But anything was\n      better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this\n      derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I\n      felt that I must scream or die! and now\u2014again!\u2014hark! louder!\n      louder! louder! _louder!_\n\n      \u201cVillains!\u201d I shrieked, \u201cdissemble no more! I admit the\n      deed!\u2014tear up the planks!\u2014here, here!\u2014It is the beating of his\n      hideous heart!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nBERENICE\n\n\n     Dicebant mihi sodales, si sepulchrum amicae visitarem, curas meas\n     aliquar tulum fore levatas.\u2014_Ebn Zaiat_.\n\n      Misery is manifold. The wretchedness of earth is multiform.\n      Overreaching the wide horizon as the rainbow, its hues are as\n      various as the hues of that arch\u2014as distinct too, yet as\n      intimately blended. Overreaching the wide horizon as the rainbow!\n      How is it that from beauty I have derived a type of\n      unloveliness?\u2014from the covenant of peace, a simile of sorrow? But\n      as, in ethics, evil is a consequence of good, so, in fact, out of\n      joy is sorrow born. Either the memory of past bliss is the\n      anguish of to-day, or the agonies which _are_, have their origin\n      in the ecstasies which _might have been_.\n\n      My baptismal name is Egaeus; that of my family I will not\n      mention. Yet there are no towers in the land more time-honored\n      than my gloomy, gray, hereditary halls. Our line has been called\n      a race of visionaries; and in many striking particulars\u2014in the\n      character of the family mansion\u2014in the frescos of the chief\n      saloon\u2014in the tapestries of the dormitories\u2014in the chiselling of\n      some buttresses in the armory\u2014but more especially in the gallery\n      of antique paintings\u2014in the fashion of the library chamber\u2014and,\n      lastly, in the very peculiar nature of the library\u2019s\n      contents\u2014there is more than sufficient evidence to warrant the\n      belief.\n\n      The recollections of my earliest years are connected with that\n      chamber, and with its volumes\u2014of which latter I will say no more.\n      Here died my mother. Herein was I born. But it is mere idleness\n      to say that I had not lived before\u2014that the soul has no previous\n      existence. You deny it?\u2014let us not argue the matter. Convinced\n      myself, I seek not to convince. There is, however, a remembrance\n      of aerial forms\u2014of spiritual and meaning eyes\u2014of sounds, musical\n      yet sad\u2014a remembrance which will not be excluded; a memory like a\n      shadow\u2014vague, variable, indefinite, unsteady; and like a shadow,\n      too, in the impossibility of my getting rid of it while the\n      sunlight of my reason shall exist.\n\n      In that chamber was I born. Thus awaking from the long night of\n      what seemed, but was not, nonentity, at once into the very\n      regions of fairy land\u2014into a palace of imagination\u2014into the wild\n      dominions of monastic thought and erudition\u2014it is not singular\n      that I gazed around me with a startled and ardent eye\u2014that I\n      loitered away my boyhood in books, and dissipated my youth in\n      reverie; but it _is_ singular that as years rolled away, and the\n      noon of manhood found me still in the mansion of my fathers\u2014it\n      _is_ wonderful what stagnation there fell upon the springs of my\n      life\u2014wonderful how total an inversion took place in the character\n      of my commonest thought. The realities of the world affected me\n      as visions, and as visions only, while the wild ideas of the land\n      of dreams became, in turn, not the material of my every-day\n      existence, but in very deed that existence utterly and solely in\n      itself.\n\n      Berenice and I were cousins, and we grew up together in my\n      paternal halls. Yet differently we grew\u2014I, ill of health, and\n      buried in gloom\u2014she, agile, graceful, and overflowing with\n      energy; hers, the ramble on the hill-side\u2014mine the studies of the\n      cloister; I, living within my own heart, and addicted, body and\n      soul, to the most intense and painful meditation\u2014she, roaming\n      carelessly through life, with no thought of the shadows in her\n      path, or the silent flight of the raven-winged hours. Berenice!\u2014I\n      call upon her name\u2014Berenice!\u2014and from the gray ruins of memory a\n      thousand tumultuous recollections are startled at the sound! Ah,\n      vividly is her image before me now, as in the early days of her\n      light-heartedness and joy! Oh, gorgeous yet fantastic beauty! Oh,\n      sylph amid the shrubberies of Arnheim! Oh, Naiad among its\n      fountains! And then\u2014then all is mystery and terror, and a tale\n      which should not be told. Disease\u2014a fatal disease, fell like the\n      simoon upon her frame; and, even while I gazed upon her, the\n      spirit of change swept over her, pervading her mind, her habits,\n      and her character, and, in a manner the most subtle and terrible,\n      disturbing even the identity of her person! Alas! the destroyer\n      came and went!\u2014and the victim\u2014where is she? I knew her not\u2014or\n      knew her no longer as Berenice.\n\n      Among the numerous train of maladies superinduced by that fatal\n      and primary one which effected a revolution of so horrible a kind\n      in the moral and physical being of my cousin, may be mentioned as\n      the most distressing and obstinate in its nature, a species of\n      epilepsy not unfrequently terminating in _trance_ itself\u2014trance\n      very nearly resembling positive dissolution, and from which her\n      manner of recovery was in most instances, startlingly abrupt. In\n      the mean time my own disease\u2014for I have been told that I should\n      call it by no other appellation\u2014my own disease, then, grew\n      rapidly upon me, and assumed finally a monomaniac character of a\n      novel and extraordinary form\u2014hourly and momently gaining\n      vigor\u2014and at length obtaining over me the most incomprehensible\n      ascendancy. This monomania, if I must so term it, consisted in a\n      morbid irritability of those properties of the mind in\n      metaphysical science termed the _attentive_. It is more than\n      probable that I am not understood; but I fear, indeed, that it is\n      in no manner possible to convey to the mind of the merely general\n      reader, an adequate idea of that nervous _intensity of interest_\n      with which, in my case, the powers of meditation (not to speak\n      technically) busied and buried themselves, in the contemplation\n      of even the most ordinary objects of the universe.\n\n      To muse for long unwearied hours, with my attention riveted to\n      some frivolous device on the margin, or in the typography of a\n      book; to become absorbed, for the better part of a summer\u2019s day,\n      in a quaint shadow falling aslant upon the tapestry or upon the\n      floor; to lose myself, for an entire night, in watching the\n      steady flame of a lamp, or the embers of a fire; to dream away\n      whole days over the perfume of a flower; to repeat, monotonously,\n      some common word, until the sound, by dint of frequent\n      repetition, ceased to convey any idea whatever to the mind; to\n      lose all sense of motion or physical existence, by means of\n      absolute bodily quiescence long and obstinately persevered in:\n      such were a few of the most common and least pernicious vagaries\n      induced by a condition of the mental faculties, not, indeed,\n      altogether unparalleled, but certainly bidding defiance to\n      anything like analysis or explanation.\n\n      Yet let me not be misapprehended. The undue, earnest, and morbid\n      attention thus excited by objects in their own nature frivolous,\n      must not be confounded in character with that ruminating\n      propensity common to all mankind, and more especially indulged in\n      by persons of ardent imagination. It was not even, as might be at\n      first supposed, an extreme condition, or exaggeration of such\n      propensity, but primarily and essentially distinct and different.\n      In the one instance, the dreamer, or enthusiast, being interested\n      by an object usually _not_ frivolous, imperceptibly loses sight\n      of this object in a wilderness of deductions and suggestions\n      issuing therefrom, until, at the conclusion of a day-dream _often\n      replete with luxury_, he finds the _incitamentum_, or first cause\n      of his musings, entirely vanished and forgotten. In my case, the\n      primary object was _invariably frivolous_, although assuming,\n      through the medium of my distempered vision, a refracted and\n      unreal importance. Few deductions, if any, were made; and those\n      few pertinaciously returning in upon the original object as a\n      centre. The meditations were _never_ pleasurable; and, at the\n      termination of the reverie, the first cause, so far from being\n      out of sight, had attained that supernaturally exaggerated\n      interest which was the prevailing feature of the disease. In a\n      word, the powers of mind more particularly exercised were, with\n      me, as I have said before, the _attentive_, and are, with the\n      day-dreamer, the _speculative_.\n\n      My books, at this epoch, if they did not actually serve to\n      irritate the disorder, partook, it will be perceived, largely, in\n      their imaginative and inconsequential nature, of the\n      characteristic qualities of the disorder itself. I well remember,\n      among others, the treatise of the noble Italian, Coelius Secundus\n      Curio, \u201c_De Amplitudine Beati Regni Dei;_\u201d St. Austin\u2019s great\n      work, the \u201cCity of God;\u201d and Tertullian\u2019s \u201c_De Carne Christi_,\u201d\n      in which the paradoxical sentence \u201c_Mortuus est Dei filius;\n      credible est quia ineptum est: et sepultus resurrexit; certum est\n      quia impossibile est,_\u201d occupied my undivided time, for many\n      weeks of laborious and fruitless investigation.\n\n      Thus it will appear that, shaken from its balance only by trivial\n      things, my reason bore resemblance to that ocean-crag spoken of\n      by Ptolemy Hephestion, which steadily resisting the attacks of\n      human violence, and the fiercer fury of the waters and the winds,\n      trembled only to the touch of the flower called Asphodel. And\n      although, to a careless thinker, it might appear a matter beyond\n      doubt, that the alteration produced by her unhappy malady, in the\n      _moral_ condition of Berenice, would afford me many objects for\n      the exercise of that intense and abnormal meditation whose nature\n      I have been at some trouble in explaining, yet such was not in\n      any degree the case. In the lucid intervals of my infirmity, her\n      calamity, indeed, gave me pain, and, taking deeply to heart that\n      total wreck of her fair and gentle life, I did not fail to\n      ponder, frequently and bitterly, upon the wonder-working means by\n      which so strange a revolution had been so suddenly brought to\n      pass. But these reflections partook not of the idiosyncrasy of my\n      disease, and were such as would have occurred, under similar\n      circumstances, to the ordinary mass of mankind. True to its own\n      character, my disorder revelled in the less important but more\n      startling changes wrought in the _physical_ frame of Berenice\u2014in\n      the singular and most appalling distortion of her personal\n      identity.\n\n      During the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty, most surely\n      I had never loved her. In the strange anomaly of my existence,\n      feelings with me, _had never been_ of the heart, and my passions\n      _always were_ of the mind. Through the gray of the early\n      morning\u2014among the trellised shadows of the forest at noonday\u2014and\n      in the silence of my library at night\u2014she had flitted by my eyes,\n      and I had seen her\u2014not as the living and breathing Berenice, but\n      as the Berenice of a dream; not as a being of the earth, earthy,\n      but as the abstraction of such a being; not as a thing to admire,\n      but to analyze; not as an object of love, but as the theme of the\n      most abstruse although desultory speculation. And _now_\u2014now I\n      shuddered in her presence, and grew pale at her approach; yet,\n      bitterly lamenting her fallen and desolate condition, I called to\n      mind that she had loved me long, and, in an evil moment, I spoke\n      to her of marriage.\n\n      And at length the period of our nuptials was approaching, when,\n      upon an afternoon in the winter of the year\u2014one of those\n      unseasonably warm, calm, and misty days which are the nurse of\n      the beautiful Halcyon (*1),\u2014I sat, (and sat, as I thought,\n      alone,) in the inner apartment of the library. But, uplifting my\n      eyes, I saw that Berenice stood before me.\n\n      Was it my own excited imagination\u2014or the misty influence of the\n      atmosphere\u2014or the uncertain twilight of the chamber\u2014or the gray\n      draperies which fell around her figure\u2014that caused in it so\n      vacillating and indistinct an outline? I could not tell. She\n      spoke no word; and I\u2014not for worlds could I have uttered a\n      syllable. An icy chill ran through my frame; a sense of\n      insufferable anxiety oppressed me; a consuming curiosity pervaded\n      my soul; and sinking back upon the chair, I remained for some\n      time breathless and motionless, with my eyes riveted upon her\n      person. Alas! its emaciation was excessive, and not one vestige\n      of the former being lurked in any single line of the contour. My\n      burning glances at length fell upon the face.\n\n      The forehead was high, and very pale, and singularly placid; and\n      the once jetty hair fell partially over it, and overshadowed the\n      hollow temples with innumerable ringlets, now of a vivid yellow,\n      and jarring discordantly, in their fantastic character, with the\n      reigning melancholy of the countenance. The eyes were lifeless,\n      and lustreless, and seemingly pupilless, and I shrank\n      involuntarily from their glassy stare to the contemplation of the\n      thin and shrunken lips. They parted; and in a smile of peculiar\n      meaning, _the teeth_ of the changed Berenice disclosed themselves\n      slowly to my view. Would to God that I had never beheld them, or\n      that, having done so, I had died!\n\n      The shutting of a door disturbed me, and, looking up, I found\n      that my cousin had departed from the chamber. But from the\n      disordered chamber of my brain, had not, alas! departed, and\n      would not be driven away, the white and ghastly _spectrum_ of the\n      teeth. Not a speck on their surface\u2014not a shade on their\n      enamel\u2014not an indenture in their edges\u2014but what that period of\n      her smile had sufficed to brand in upon my memory. I saw them\n      _now_ even more unequivocally than I beheld them _then_. The\n      teeth!\u2014the teeth!\u2014they were here, and there, and everywhere, and\n      visibly and palpably before me; long, narrow, and excessively\n      white, with the pale lips writhing about them, as in the very\n      moment of their first terrible development. Then came the full\n      fury of my _monomania_, and I struggled in vain against its\n      strange and irresistible influence. In the multiplied objects of\n      the external world I had no thoughts but for the teeth. For these\n      I longed with a phrenzied desire. All other matters and all\n      different interests became absorbed in their single\n      contemplation. They\u2014they alone were present to the mental eye,\n      and they, in their sole individuality, became the essence of my\n      mental life. I held them in every light. I turned them in every\n      attitude. I surveyed their characteristics. I dwelt upon their\n      peculiarities. I pondered upon their conformation. I mused upon\n      the alteration in their nature. I shuddered as I assigned to them\n      in imagination a sensitive and sentient power, and even when\n      unassisted by the lips, a capability of moral expression. Of\n      Mademoiselle Salle it has been well said, \u201c_Que tous ses pas\n      etaient des sentiments_,\u201d and of Berenice I more seriously\n      believed _que toutes ses dents etaient des id\u00e9es_. _Des\n      id\u00e9es!_\u2014ah here was the idiotic thought that destroyed me! _Des\n      id\u00e9es!_\u2014ah, _therefore_ it was that I coveted them so madly! I\n      felt that their possession could alone ever restore me to peace,\n      in giving me back to reason.\n\n      And the evening closed in upon me thus\u2014and then the darkness\n      came, and tarried, and went\u2014and the day again dawned\u2014and the\n      mists of a second night were now gathering around\u2014and still I sat\n      motionless in that solitary room\u2014and still I sat buried in\n      meditation\u2014and still the _phantasma_ of the teeth maintained its\n      terrible ascendancy, as, with the most vivid hideous\n      distinctness, it floated about amid the changing lights and\n      shadows of the chamber. At length there broke in upon my dreams a\n      cry as of horror and dismay; and thereunto, after a pause,\n      succeeded the sound of troubled voices, intermingled with many\n      low moanings of sorrow or of pain. I arose from my seat, and\n      throwing open one of the doors of the library, saw standing out\n      in the ante-chamber a servant maiden, all in tears, who told me\n      that Berenice was\u2014no more! She had been seized with epilepsy in\n      the early morning, and now, at the closing in of the night, the\n      grave was ready for its tenant, and all the preparations for the\n      burial were completed.\n\n      I found myself sitting in the library, and again sitting there\n      alone. It seemed that I had newly awakened from a confused and\n      exciting dream. I knew that it was now midnight, and I was well\n      aware, that since the setting of the sun, Berenice had been\n      interred. But of that dreary period which intervened I had no\n      positive, at least no definite comprehension. Yet its memory was\n      replete with horror\u2014horror more horrible from being vague, and\n      terror more terrible from ambiguity. It was a fearful page in the\n      record my existence, written all over with dim, and hideous, and\n      unintelligible recollections. I strived to decypher them, but in\n      vain; while ever and anon, like the spirit of a departed sound,\n      the shrill and piercing shriek of a female voice seemed to be\n      ringing in my ears. I had done a deed\u2014what was it? I asked myself\n      the question aloud, and the whispering echoes of the chamber\n      answered me,\u2014\u201c_What was it?_\u201d\n\n      On the table beside me burned a lamp, and near it lay a little\n      box. It was of no remarkable character, and I had seen it\n      frequently before, for it was the property of the family\n      physician; but how came it _there_, upon my table, and why did I\n      shudder in regarding it? These things were in no manner to be\n      accounted for, and my eyes at length dropped to the open pages of\n      a book, and to a sentence underscored therein. The words were the\n      singular but simple ones of the poet Ebn Zaiat:\u2014\u201c_Dicebant mihi\n      sodales si sepulchrum amicae visitarem, curas meas aliquantulum\n      fore levatas_.\u201d Why then, as I perused them, did the hairs of my\n      head erect themselves on end, and the blood of my body become\n      congealed within my veins?\n\n      There came a light tap at the library door\u2014and, pale as the\n      tenant of a tomb, a menial entered upon tiptoe. His looks were\n      wild with terror, and he spoke to me in a voice tremulous, husky,\n      and very low. What said he?\u2014some broken sentences I heard. He\n      told of a wild cry disturbing the silence of the night\u2014of the\n      gathering together of the household\u2014of a search in the direction\n      of the sound; and then his tones grew thrillingly distinct as he\n      whispered me of a violated grave\u2014of a disfigured body enshrouded,\n      yet still breathing\u2014still palpitating\u2014_still alive_!\n\n      He pointed to garments;\u2014they were muddy and clotted with gore. I\n      spoke not, and he took me gently by the hand: it was indented\n      with the impress of human nails. He directed my attention to some\n      object against the wall. I looked at it for some minutes: it was\n      a spade. With a shriek I bounded to the table, and grasped the\n      box that lay upon it. But I could not force it open; and in my\n      tremor, it slipped from my hands, and fell heavily, and burst\n      into pieces; and from it, with a rattling sound, there rolled out\n      some instruments of dental surgery, intermingled with thirty-two\n      small, white and ivory-looking substances that were scattered to\n      and fro about the floor.\n\n\n\n\nELEONORA\n\n\n     Sub conservatione form\u00e6 specific\u00e6 salva anima.\n                    \u2014_Raymond Lully_.\n\n      I am come of a race noted for vigor of fancy and ardor of\n      passion. Men have called me mad; but the question is not yet\n      settled, whether madness is or is not the loftiest\n      intelligence\u2014whether much that is glorious\u2014whether all that is\n      profound\u2014does not spring from disease of thought\u2014from moods of\n      mind exalted at the expense of the general intellect. They who\n      dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who\n      dream only by night. In their gray visions they obtain glimpses\n      of eternity, and thrill, in awakening, to find that they have\n      been upon the verge of the great secret. In snatches, they learn\n      something of the wisdom which is of good, and more of the mere\n      knowledge which is of evil. They penetrate, however, rudderless\n      or compassless into the vast ocean of the \u201clight ineffable,\u201d and\n      again, like the adventures of the Nubian geographer, \u201cagressi\n      sunt mare tenebrarum, quid in eo esset exploraturi.\u201d\n\n      We will say, then, that I am mad. I grant, at least, that there\n      are two distinct conditions of my mental existence\u2014the condition\n      of a lucid reason, not to be disputed, and belonging to the\n      memory of events forming the first epoch of my life\u2014and a\n      condition of shadow and doubt, appertaining to the present, and\n      to the recollection of what constitutes the second great era of\n      my being. Therefore, what I shall tell of the earlier period,\n      believe; and to what I may relate of the later time, give only\n      such credit as may seem due, or doubt it altogether, or, if doubt\n      it ye cannot, then play unto its riddle the Oedipus.\n\n      She whom I loved in youth, and of whom I now pen calmly and\n      distinctly these remembrances, was the sole daughter of the only\n      sister of my mother long departed. Eleonora was the name of my\n      cousin. We had always dwelled together, beneath a tropical sun,\n      in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass. No unguided footstep\n      ever came upon that vale; for it lay away up among a range of\n      giant hills that hung beetling around about it, shutting out the\n      sunlight from its sweetest recesses. No path was trodden in its\n      vicinity; and, to reach our happy home, there was need of putting\n      back, with force, the foliage of many thousands of forest trees,\n      and of crushing to death the glories of many millions of fragrant\n      flowers. Thus it was that we lived all alone, knowing nothing of\n      the world without the valley\u2014I, and my cousin, and her mother.\n\n      From the dim regions beyond the mountains at the upper end of our\n      encircled domain, there crept out a narrow and deep river,\n      brighter than all save the eyes of Eleonora; and, winding\n      stealthily about in mazy courses, it passed away, at length,\n      through a shadowy gorge, among hills still dimmer than those\n      whence it had issued. We called it the \u201cRiver of Silence\u201d; for\n      there seemed to be a hushing influence in its flow. No murmur\n      arose from its bed, and so gently it wandered along, that the\n      pearly pebbles upon which we loved to gaze, far down within its\n      bosom, stirred not at all, but lay in a motionless content, each\n      in its own old station, shining on gloriously forever.\n\n      The margin of the river, and of the many dazzling rivulets that\n      glided through devious ways into its channel, as well as the\n      spaces that extended from the margins away down into the depths\n      of the streams until they reached the bed of pebbles at the\n      bottom,\u2014these spots, not less than the whole surface of the\n      valley, from the river to the mountains that girdled it in, were\n      carpeted all by a soft green grass, thick, short, perfectly even,\n      and vanilla-perfumed, but so besprinkled throughout with the\n      yellow buttercup, the white daisy, the purple violet, and the\n      ruby-red asphodel, that its exceeding beauty spoke to our hearts\n      in loud tones, of the love and of the glory of God.\n\n      And, here and there, in groves about this grass, like\n      wildernesses of dreams, sprang up fantastic trees, whose tall\n      slender stems stood not upright, but slanted gracefully toward\n      the light that peered at noon-day into the centre of the valley.\n      Their mark was speckled with the vivid alternate splendor of\n      ebony and silver, and was smoother than all save the cheeks of\n      Eleonora; so that, but for the brilliant green of the huge leaves\n      that spread from their summits in long, tremulous lines, dallying\n      with the Zephyrs, one might have fancied them giant serpents of\n      Syria doing homage to their sovereign the Sun.\n\n      Hand in hand about this valley, for fifteen years, roamed I with\n      Eleonora before Love entered within our hearts. It was one\n      evening at the close of the third lustrum of her life, and of the\n      fourth of my own, that we sat, locked in each other\u2019s embrace,\n      beneath the serpent-like trees, and looked down within the water\n      of the River of Silence at our images therein. We spoke no words\n      during the rest of that sweet day, and our words even upon the\n      morrow were tremulous and few. We had drawn the God Eros from\n      that wave, and now we felt that he had enkindled within us the\n      fiery souls of our forefathers. The passions which had for\n      centuries distinguished our race, came thronging with the fancies\n      for which they had been equally noted, and together breathed a\n      delirious bliss over the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass. A\n      change fell upon all things. Strange, brilliant flowers,\n      star-shaped, burn out upon the trees where no flowers had been\n      known before. The tints of the green carpet deepened; and when,\n      one by one, the white daisies shrank away, there sprang up in\n      place of them, ten by ten of the ruby-red asphodel. And life\n      arose in our paths; for the tall flamingo, hitherto unseen, with\n      all gay glowing birds, flaunted his scarlet plumage before us.\n      The golden and silver fish haunted the river, out of the bosom of\n      which issued, little by little, a murmur that swelled, at length,\n      into a lulling melody more divine than that of the harp of\n      \u00c6olus\u2014sweeter than all save the voice of Eleonora. And now, too,\n      a voluminous cloud, which we had long watched in the regions of\n      Hesper, floated out thence, all gorgeous in crimson and gold, and\n      settling in peace above us, sank, day by day, lower and lower,\n      until its edges rested upon the tops of the mountains, turning\n      all their dimness into magnificence, and shutting us up, as if\n      forever, within a magic prison-house of grandeur and of glory.\n\n      The loveliness of Eleonora was that of the Seraphim; but she was\n      a maiden artless and innocent as the brief life she had led among\n      the flowers. No guile disguised the fervor of love which animated\n      her heart, and she examined with me its inmost recesses as we\n      walked together in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass, and\n      discoursed of the mighty changes which had lately taken place\n      therein.\n\n      At length, having spoken one day, in tears, of the last sad\n      change which must befall Humanity, she thenceforward dwelt only\n      upon this one sorrowful theme, interweaving it into all our\n      converse, as, in the songs of the bard of Schiraz, the same\n      images are found occurring, again and again, in every impressive\n      variation of phrase.\n\n      She had seen that the finger of Death was upon her bosom\u2014that,\n      like the ephemeron, she had been made perfect in loveliness only\n      to die; but the terrors of the grave to her lay solely in a\n      consideration which she revealed to me, one evening at twilight,\n      by the banks of the River of Silence. She grieved to think that,\n      having entombed her in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass, I\n      would quit forever its happy recesses, transferring the love\n      which now was so passionately her own to some maiden of the outer\n      and everyday world. And, then and there, I threw myself hurriedly\n      at the feet of Eleonora, and offered up a vow, to herself and to\n      Heaven, that I would never bind myself in marriage to any\n      daughter of Earth\u2014that I would in no manner prove recreant to her\n      dear memory, or to the memory of the devout affection with which\n      she had blessed me. And I called the Mighty Ruler of the Universe\n      to witness the pious solemnity of my vow. And the curse which I\n      invoked of Him and of her, a saint in Helusion should I prove\n      traitorous to that promise, involved a penalty the exceeding\n      great horror of which will not permit me to make record of it\n      here. And the bright eyes of Eleonora grew brighter at my words;\n      and she sighed as if a deadly burthen had been taken from her\n      breast; and she trembled and very bitterly wept; but she made\n      acceptance of the vow, (for what was she but a child?) and it\n      made easy to her the bed of her death. And she said to me, not\n      many days afterward, tranquilly dying, that, because of what I\n      had done for the comfort of her spirit she would watch over me in\n      that spirit when departed, and, if so it were permitted her\n      return to me visibly in the watches of the night; but, if this\n      thing were, indeed, beyond the power of the souls in Paradise,\n      that she would, at least, give me frequent indications of her\n      presence, sighing upon me in the evening winds, or filling the\n      air which I breathed with perfume from the censers of the angels.\n      And, with these words upon her lips, she yielded up her innocent\n      life, putting an end to the first epoch of my own.\n\n      Thus far I have faithfully said. But as I pass the barrier in\n      Time\u2019s path, formed by the death of my beloved, and proceed with\n      the second era of my existence, I feel that a shadow gathers over\n      my brain, and I mistrust the perfect sanity of the record. But\n      let me on.\u2014Years dragged themselves along heavily, and still I\n      dwelled within the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass; but a second\n      change had come upon all things. The star-shaped flowers shrank\n      into the stems of the trees, and appeared no more. The tints of\n      the green carpet faded; and, one by one, the ruby-red asphodels\n      withered away; and there sprang up, in place of them, ten by ten,\n      dark, eye-like violets, that writhed uneasily and were ever\n      encumbered with dew. And Life departed from our paths; for the\n      tall flamingo flaunted no longer his scarlet plumage before us,\n      but flew sadly from the vale into the hills, with all the gay\n      glowing birds that had arrived in his company. And the golden and\n      silver fish swam down through the gorge at the lower end of our\n      domain and bedecked the sweet river never again. And the lulling\n      melody that had been softer than the wind-harp of \u00c6olus, and more\n      divine than all save the voice of Eleonora, it died little by\n      little away, in murmurs growing lower and lower, until the stream\n      returned, at length, utterly, into the solemnity of its original\n      silence. And then, lastly, the voluminous cloud uprose, and,\n      abandoning the tops of the mountains to the dimness of old, fell\n      back into the regions of Hesper, and took away all its manifold\n      golden and gorgeous glories from the Valley of the Many-Colored\n      Grass.\n\n      Yet the promises of Eleonora were not forgotten; for I heard the\n      sounds of the swinging of the censers of the angels; and streams\n      of a holy perfume floated ever and ever about the valley; and at\n      lone hours, when my heart beat heavily, the winds that bathed my\n      brow came unto me laden with soft sighs; and indistinct murmurs\n      filled often the night air, and once\u2014oh, but once only! I was\n      awakened from a slumber, like the slumber of death, by the\n      pressing of spiritual lips upon my own.\n\n      But the void within my heart refused, even thus, to be filled. I\n      longed for the love which had before filled it to overflowing. At\n      length the valley pained me through its memories of Eleonora, and\n      I left it for ever for the vanities and the turbulent triumphs of\n      the world.\n\n      I found myself within a strange city, where all things might have\n      served to blot from recollection the sweet dreams I had dreamed\n      so long in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass. The pomps and\n      pageantries of a stately court, and the mad clangor of arms, and\n      the radiant loveliness of women, bewildered and intoxicated my\n      brain. But as yet my soul had proved true to its vows, and the\n      indications of the presence of Eleonora were still given me in\n      the silent hours of the night. Suddenly these manifestations they\n      ceased, and the world grew dark before mine eyes, and I stood\n      aghast at the burning thoughts which possessed, at the terrible\n      temptations which beset me; for there came from some far, far\n      distant and unknown land, into the gay court of the king I\n      served, a maiden to whose beauty my whole recreant heart yielded\n      at once\u2014at whose footstool I bowed down without a struggle, in\n      the most ardent, in the most abject worship of love. What,\n      indeed, was my passion for the young girl of the valley in\n      comparison with the fervor, and the delirium, and the\n      spirit-lifting ecstasy of adoration with which I poured out my\n      whole soul in tears at the feet of the ethereal Ermengarde?\u2014Oh,\n      bright was the seraph Ermengarde! and in that knowledge I had\n      room for none other. Oh, divine was the angel Ermengarde! and as\n      I looked down into the depths of her memorial eyes, I thought\n      only of them\u2014and of her.\n\n      I wedded\u2014nor dreaded the curse I had invoked; and its bitterness\n      was not visited upon me. And once\u2014but once again in the silence\n      of the night; there came through my lattice the soft sighs which\n      had forsaken me; and they modelled themselves into familiar and\n      sweet voice, saying:\n\n      \u201cSleep in peace! for the Spirit of Love reigneth and ruleth, and,\n      in taking to thy passionate heart her who is Ermengarde, thou art\n      absolved, for reasons which shall be made known to thee in\n      Heaven, of thy vows unto Eleonora.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nNOTES TO THE SECOND VOLUME\n\n\nNotes \u2014 Scheherazade\n\n      (*1) The coralites.\n\n      (*2) \u201cOne of the most remarkable natural curiosities in Texas is\n      a petrified forest, near the head of Pasigno river. It consists\n      of several hundred trees, in an erect position, all turned to\n      stone. Some trees, now growing, are partly petrified. This is a\n      startling fact for natural philosophers, and must cause them to\n      modify the existing theory of petrification.\u2014_Kennedy_.\n\n      This account, at first discredited, has since been corroborated\n      by the discovery of a completely petrified forest, near the head\n      waters of the Cheyenne, or Chienne river, which has its source in\n      the Black Hills of the rocky chain.\n\n      There is scarcely, perhaps, a spectacle on the surface of the\n      globe more remarkable, either in a geological or picturesque\n      point of view than that presented by the petrified forest, near\n      Cairo. The traveller, having passed the tombs of the caliphs,\n      just beyond the gates of the city, proceeds to the southward,\n      nearly at right angles to the road across the desert to Suez, and\n      after having travelled some ten miles up a low barren valley,\n      covered with sand, gravel, and sea shells, fresh as if the tide\n      had retired but yesterday, crosses a low range of sandhills,\n      which has for some distance run parallel to his path. The scene\n      now presented to him is beyond conception singular and desolate.\n      A mass of fragments of trees, all converted into stone, and when\n      struck by his horse\u2019s hoof ringing like cast iron, is seen to\n      extend itself for miles and miles around him, in the form of a\n      decayed and prostrate forest. The wood is of a dark brown hue,\n      but retains its form in perfection, the pieces being from one to\n      fifteen feet in length, and from half a foot to three feet in\n      thickness, strewed so closely together, as far as the eye can\n      reach, that an Egyptian donkey can scarcely thread its way\n      through amongst them, and so natural that, were it in Scotland or\n      Ireland, it might pass without remark for some enormous drained\n      bog, on which the exhumed trees lay rotting in the sun. The roots\n      and rudiments of the branches are, in many cases, nearly perfect,\n      and in some the worm-holes eaten under the bark are readily\n      recognizable. The most delicate of the sap vessels, and all the\n      finer portions of the centre of the wood, are perfectly entire,\n      and bear to be examined with the strongest magnifiers. The whole\n      are so thoroughly silicified as to scratch glass and are capable\n      of receiving the highest polish.\u2014 _Asiatic Magazine_.\n\n      (*3) The Mammoth Cave of Kentucky.\n\n      (*4) In Iceland, 1783.\n\n      (*5) \u201cDuring the eruption of Hecla, in 1766, clouds of this kind\n      produced such a degree of darkness that, at Glaumba, which is\n      more than fifty leagues from the mountain, people could only find\n      their way by groping. During the eruption of Vesuvius, in 1794,\n      at Caserta, four leagues distant, people could only walk by the\n      light of torches. On the first of May, 1812, a cloud of volcanic\n      ashes and sand, coming from a volcano in the island of St.\n      Vincent, covered the whole of Barbadoes, spreading over it so\n      intense a darkness that, at mid-day, in the open air, one could\n      not perceive the trees or other objects near him, or even a white\n      handkerchief placed at the distance of six inches from the\n      eye._\u201c\u2014Murray, p. 215, Phil. edit._\n\n      (*6) In the year 1790, in the Caraccas during an earthquake a\n      portion of the granite soil sank and left a lake eight hundred\n      yards in diameter, and from eighty to a hundred feet deep.

Williams, of Salem, Mass._, presented the \u201cNational\n      Institute\u201d with an insect from New Zealand, with the following\n      description: \u201c\u2018_The Hotte_, a decided caterpillar, or worm, is\n      found gnawing at the root of the _Rota_ tree, with a plant\n      growing out of its head. This most peculiar and extraordinary\n      insect travels up both the _Rota_ and _Ferriri_ trees, and\n      entering into the top, eats its way, perforating the trunk of the\n      trees until it reaches the root, and dies, or remains dormant,\n      and the plant propagates out of its head; the body remains\n      perfect and entire, of a harder substance than when alive. From\n      this insect the natives make a coloring for tattooing.\n\n      (*13) In mines and natural caves we find a species of\n      cryptogamous _fungus_ that emits an intense phosphorescence.\n\n      (*14) The orchis, scabius and valisneria.\n\n      (*15) The corolla of this flower (_Aristolochia Clematitis_),\n      which is tubular, but terminating upwards in a ligulate limb, is\n      inflated into a globular figure at the base. The tubular part is\n      internally beset with stiff hairs, pointing downwards. The\n      globular part contains the pistil, which consists merely of a\n      germen and stigma, together with the surrounding stamens. But the\n      stamens, being shorter than the germen, cannot discharge the\n      pollen so as to throw it upon the stigma, as the flower stands\n      always upright till after impregnation. And hence, without some\n      additional and peculiar aid, the pollen must necessarily fan down\n      to the bottom of the flower. Now, the aid that nature has\n      furnished in this case, is that of the _Tiputa Pennicornis_, a\n      small insect, which entering the tube of the corrolla in quest of\n      honey, descends to the bottom, and rummages about till it becomes\n      quite covered with pollen; but not being able to force its way\n      out again, owing to the downward position of the hairs, which\n      converge to a point like the wires of a mouse-trap, and being\n      somewhat impatient of its confinement it brushes backwards and\n      forwards, trying every corner, till, after repeatedly traversing\n      the stigma, it covers it with pollen sufficient for its\n      impregnation, in consequence of which the flower soon begins to\n      droop, and the hairs to shrink to the sides of the tube,\n      effecting an easy passage for the escape of the insect.\u201d\u2014_Rev. P.\n      Keith-System of Physiological Botany_.\n\n      (*16) The bees\u2014ever since bees were\u2014have been constructing their\n      cells with just such sides, in just such number, and at just such\n      inclinations, as it has been demonstrated (in a problem involving\n      the profoundest mathematical principles) are the very sides, in\n      the very number, and at the very angles, which will afford the\n      creatures the most room that is compatible with the greatest\n      stability of structure.\n\n      During the latter part of the last century, the question arose\n      among mathematicians\u2014\u201cto determine the best form that can be\n      given to the sails of a windmill, according to their varying\n      distances from the revolving vanes, and likewise from the centres\n      of the revolution.\u201d This is an excessively complex problem, for\n      it is, in other words, to find the best possible position at an\n      infinity of varied distances and at an infinity of points on the\n      arm. There were a thousand futile attempts to answer the query on\n      the part of the most illustrious mathematicians, and when at\n      length, an undeniable solution was discovered, men found that the\n      wings of a bird had given it with absolute precision ever since\n      the first bird had traversed the air.\n\n      (*17) He observed a flock of pigeons passing betwixt Frankfort\n      and the Indian territory, one mile at least in breadth; it took\n      up four hours in passing, which, at the rate of one mile per\n      minute, gives a length of 240 miles; and, supposing three pigeons\n      to each square yard, gives 2,230,272,000 Pigeons.\u2014\u201c_Travels in\n      Canada and the United States,\u201d by Lieut.

If two red rays\n      from two luminous points be admitted into a dark chamber so as to\n      fall on a white surface, and differ in their length by 0.0000258\n      of an inch, their intensity is doubled. So also if the difference\n      in length be any whole-number multiple of that fraction. A\n      multiple by 2 1/4, 3 1/4, &c., gives an intensity equal to one\n      ray only; but a multiple by 2 1/2, 3 1/2, &c., gives the result\n      of total darkness. In violet rays similar effects arise when the\n      difference in length is 0.000157 of an inch; and with all other\n      rays the results are the same\u2014the difference varying with a\n      uniform increase from the violet to the red.\n\n      \u201cAnalogous experiments in respect to sound produce analogous\n      results.\u201d\n\n      (*32) Place a platina crucible over a spirit lamp, and keep it a\n      red heat; pour in some sulphuric acid, which, though the most\n      volatile of bodies at a common temperature, will be found to\n      become completely fixed in a hot crucible, and not a drop\n      evaporates\u2014being surrounded by an atmosphere of its own, it does\n      not, in fact, touch the sides. A few drops of water are now\n      introduced, when the acid, immediately coming in contact with the\n      heated sides of the crucible, flies off in sulphurous acid vapor,\n      and so rapid is its progress, that the caloric of the water\n      passes off with it, which falls a lump of ice to the bottom; by\n      taking advantage of the moment before it is allowed to remelt, it\n      may be turned out a lump of ice from a red-hot vessel.\n\n      (*33) The Daguerreotype.\n\n      (*34) Although light travels 167,000 miles in a second, the\n      distance of 61 Cygni (the only star whose distance is\n      ascertained) is so inconceivably great, that its rays would\n      require more than ten years to reach the earth. For stars beyond\n      this, 20\u2014or even 1000 years\u2014would be a moderate estimate. Thus,\n      if they had been annihilated 20, or 1000 years ago, we might\n      still see them to-day by the light which started from their\n      surfaces 20 or 1000 years in the past time.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.",

The names are also used to refer to acorpse or hospital patient whose identity is unknown. This practice is widely used in the United States and Canada, but is rarely used in other English-speaking countries including the United Kingdom itself, from where the use of \"John Doe\" in a legal context originates. The names Joe Bloggs or John Smith are used in the UK instead, as well as in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nJohn Doe is sometimes used to refer to a typical male in other contexts as well, in a similar manner to John Q. Public, known in Great Britain as Joe Public, John Smith or Joe Bloggs. For example, the first name listed on a form is often John Doe, along with a fictional address or other fictional information to provide an example of how to fill in the form. The name is also used frequently in popular culture, for example in the Frank Capra film Meet John Doe. John Doe was also the name of a 2002 American television series.\n\nSimilarly, a child or baby whose identity is unknown may be referred to as Baby Doe. A notorious murder case in Kansas City, Missouri, referred to the baby victim as Precious Doe. Other unidentified female murder victims are Cali Doe and Princess Doe. Additional persons may be called James Doe, Judy Doe, etc. However, to avoid possible confusion, if two anonymous or unknown parties are cited in a specific case or action, the surnames Doe and Roe may be used simultaneously; for example, \"John Doe v. Jane Roe\". If several anonymous parties are referenced, they may simply be labelled John Doe #1, John Doe #2, etc. (the U.S. Operation Delego cited 21 (numbered) \"John Doe\"s) or labelled with other variants of Doe / Roe / Poe / etc. Other early alternatives such as John Stiles and Richard Miles are now rarely used, and Mary Major has been used in some American federal cases.\n\n\n\nFile created by https://www.online-convert.com\nMore example files: https://www.online-convert.com/file-type\nText of Example content: Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doe)\nLicense: Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)\n\nFeel free to use and share the file according to the license above.",
        "summary": "The text provides an overview of the use of placeholder names \"John Doe\" and \"Jane Doe\" in legal and medical contexts in the United States and Canada. These names are used to protect the identities of individuals in legal actions or discussions, whereas other names like \"Joe Bloggs\" or \"John Smith\" are commonly used in the UK. The text also highlights that \"John Doe\" can refer to a typical male or be used in forms as a fictional example. Additionally, variations like \"Baby Doe\" are used for unidentified infants, while multiple unidentified parties may be designated with numbered names or variations of Doe/Roe.
