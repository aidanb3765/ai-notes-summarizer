Scott Fitzgerald\n\n\n\nThen wear the gold hat, if that will move her;\n  If you can bounce high, bounce for her too,\nTill she cry \"Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover,\n  I must have you!\"\n\n                    --THOMAS PARKE D'INVILLIERS\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\n\n\nIn my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice\nthat I've been turning over in my mind ever since.\n\n\"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,\" he told me, \"just\nremember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages\nthat you've had.\"\n\nHe didn't say any more but we've always been unusually communicative\nin a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more\nthan that. In consequence I'm inclined to reserve all judgments,\na habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also\nmade me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind\nis quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it\nappears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I\nwas unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the\nsecret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were\nunsought--frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile\nlevity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate\nrevelation was quivering on the horizon--for the intimate revelations\nof young men or at least the terms in which they express them are\nusually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving\njudgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of\nmissing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested,\nand I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is\nparcelled out unequally at birth.\n\nAnd, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission\nthat it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet\nmarshes but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on.\nWhen I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the\nworld to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I\nwanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the\nhuman heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was\nexempt from my reaction--Gatsby who represented everything for which I\nhave an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of\nsuccessful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some\nheightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related\nto one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten\nthousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that\nflabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the\n\"creative temperament\"--it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic\nreadiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it\nis not likely I shall ever find again. No--Gatsby turned out all right\nat the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the\nwake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the\nabortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.\n\n\nMy family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle-western\ncity for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan and we\nhave a tradition that we're descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the\nactual founder of my line was my grandfather's brother who came here in\nfifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War and started the wholesale\nhardware business that my father carries on today.\n\nI never saw this great-uncle but I'm supposed to look like him--with\nspecial reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in\nFather's office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a\ncentury after my father, and a little later I participated in that\ndelayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the\ncounter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being\nthe warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like the\nragged edge of the universe--so I decided to go east and learn the bond\nbusiness. Everybody I knew was in the bond business so I supposed it\ncould support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it\nover as if they were choosing a prep-school for me and finally said,\n\"Why--ye-es\" with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance\nme for a year and after various delays I came east, permanently, I\nthought, in the spring of twenty-two.\n\nThe practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was a warm\nseason and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees,\nso when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house\ntogether in a commuting town it sounded like a great idea. He found\nthe house, a weather beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but\nat the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went out\nto the country alone. I had a dog, at least I had him for a few days\nuntil he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman who made my bed\nand cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the\nelectric stove.\n\nIt was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently\narrived than I, stopped me on the road.\n\n\"How do you get to West Egg village?\" he asked helplessly.\n\nI told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a\npathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the\nfreedom of the neighborhood.\n\nAnd so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the\ntrees--just as things grow in fast movies--I had that familiar\nconviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.\n\nThere was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health to be\npulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen\nvolumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood\non my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to\nunfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas\nknew. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides.\nI was rather literary in college--one year I wrote a series of very\nsolemn and obvious editorials for the \"Yale News\"--and now I was going\nto bring back all such things into my life and become again that most\nlimited of all specialists, the \"well-rounded man.\" This isn't just an\nepigram--life is much more successfully looked at from a single window,\nafter all.\n\nIt was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of\nthe strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender\nriotous island which extends itself due east of New York and where\nthere are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of\nland. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in\ncontour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most\ndomesticated body of salt water in the Western Hemisphere, the great\nwet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals--like the\negg in the Columbus story they are both crushed flat at the contact\nend--but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual\nconfusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more\narresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except\nshape and size.\n\nI lived at West Egg, the--well, the less fashionable of the two, though\nthis is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little\nsinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the\negg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge\nplaces that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on\nmy right was a colossal affair by any standard--it was a factual\nimitation of some H\u00f4tel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side,\nspanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool\nand more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby's mansion.\nOr rather, as I didn't know Mr. Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by\na gentleman of that name. My own house was an eye-sore, but it was a\nsmall eye-sore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the\nwater, a partial view of my neighbor's lawn, and the consoling\nproximity of millionaires--all for eighty dollars a month.\n\nAcross the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg\nglittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins\non the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom\nBuchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed and I'd known Tom\nin college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in\nChicago.\n\nHer husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of\nthe most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven--a\nnational figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute\nlimited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of\nanti-climax. His family were enormously wealthy--even in college his\nfreedom with money was a matter for reproach--but now he'd left Chicago\nand come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for\ninstance he'd brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest.\nIt was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy\nenough to do that.\n\nWhy they came east I don't know. They had spent a year in France, for no\nparticular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever\npeople played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move,\nsaid Daisy over the telephone, but I didn't believe it--I had no sight\ninto Daisy's heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking\na little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable\nfootball game.\n\nAnd so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East\nEgg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was\neven more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red and white Georgian\nColonial mansion overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach\nand ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over\nsun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens--finally when it reached\nthe house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the\nmomentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows,\nglowing now with reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy\nafternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his\nlegs apart on the front porch.\n\nHe had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy, straw haired\nman of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner.\nTwo shining, arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and\ngave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not\neven the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous\npower of that body--he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he\nstrained the top lacing and you could see a great pack of muscle\nshifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body\ncapable of enormous leverage--a cruel body.\n\nHis speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of\nfractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in\nit, even toward people he liked--and there were men at New Haven who had\nhated his guts.\n\n\"Now, don't think my opinion on these matters is final,\" he seemed to\nsay, \"just because I'm stronger and more of a man than you are.\" We\nwere in the same Senior Society, and while we were never intimate I\nalways had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like\nhim with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.\n\nWe talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.\n\n\"I've got a nice place here,\" he said, his eyes flashing about\nrestlessly.\n\nTurning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat hand along the\nfront vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half\nacre of deep pungent roses and a snub-nosed motor boat that bumped\nthe tide off shore.\n\n\"It belonged to Demaine the oil man.\" He turned me around again,\npolitely and abruptly. \"We'll go inside.\"\n\nWe walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space,\nfragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end.\nThe windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass\noutside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze\nblew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other\nlike pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of\nthe ceiling--and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a\nshadow on it as wind does on the sea.\n\nThe only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch\non which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored\nballoon. They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and\nfluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight\naround the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the\nwhip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall.\nThen there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught\nwind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two\nyoung women ballooned slowly to the floor.\n\nThe younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length\nat her end of the divan, completely motionless and with her chin raised\na little as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely\nto fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of\nit--indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having\ndisturbed her by coming in.\n\nThe other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise--she leaned slightly\nforward with a conscientious expression--then she laughed, an absurd,\ncharming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the\nroom.\n\n\"I'm p-paralyzed with happiness.\"\n\nShe laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand\nfor a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one\nin the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had.\nShe hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker.\n(I've heard it said that Daisy's murmur was only to make people\nlean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)\n\nAt any rate Miss Baker's lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost\nimperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back again--the object\nshe was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something\nof a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any\nexhibition of complete self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.\n\nI looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low,\nthrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and\ndown as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be\nplayed again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,\nbright eyes and a bright passionate mouth--but there was an excitement\nin her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget:\na singing compulsion, a whispered \"Listen,\" a promise that she had done\ngay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,\nexciting things hovering in the next hour.\n\nI told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way east\nand how a dozen people had sent their love through me.\n\n\"Do they miss me?\" she cried ecstatically.\n\n\"The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel\npainted black as a mourning wreath and there's a persistent wail all\nnight along the North Shore.\"\n\n\"How gorgeous! Let's go back, Tom. Tomorrow!\" Then she added\nirrelevantly, \"You ought to see the baby.\"\n\n\"I'd like to.\"\n\n\"She's asleep. She's two years old. Haven't you ever seen her?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Well, you ought to see her. She's----\"\n\nTom Buchanan who had been hovering restlessly about the room stopped\nand rested his hand on my shoulder.\n\n\"What you doing, Nick?\"\n\n\"I'm a bond man.\"\n\n\"Who with?\"\n\nI told him.\n\n\"Never heard of them,\" he remarked decisively.\n\nThis annoyed me.\n\n\"You will,\" I answered shortly. \"You will if you stay in the East.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll stay in the East, don't you worry,\" he said, glancing at\nDaisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more.\n\"I'd be a God Damned fool to live anywhere else.\"\n\nAt this point Miss Baker said \"Absolutely!\" with such suddenness that I\nstarted--it was the first word she uttered since I came into the room.\nEvidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and\nwith a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.\n\n\"I'm stiff,\" she complained, \"I've been lying on that sofa for as long\nas I can remember.\"\n\n\"Don't look at me,\" Daisy retorted. \"I've been trying to get you to New\nYork all afternoon.\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the\npantry, \"I'm absolutely in training.\"\n\nHer host looked at her incredulously.\n\n\"You are!\" He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of\na glass. \"How you ever get anything done is beyond me.\"\n\nI looked at Miss Baker wondering what it was she \"got done.\" I enjoyed\nlooking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect\ncarriage which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the\nshoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at\nme with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming discontented\nface. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her,\nsomewhere before.\n\n\"You live in West Egg,\" she remarked contemptuously. \"I know somebody\nthere.\"\n\n\"I don't know a single----\"\n\n\"You must know Gatsby.\"\n\n\"Gatsby?\" demanded Daisy. \"What Gatsby?\"\n\nBefore I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced;\nwedging his tense arm imperatively under mine Tom Buchanan compelled\nme from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.\n\nSlenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips the two\nyoung women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch open toward the\nsunset where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished\nwind.\n\n\"Why CANDLES?\" objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her\nfingers. \"In two weeks it'll be the longest day in the year.\"\nShe looked at us all radiantly. \"Do you always watch for the longest day\nof the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the\nyear and then miss it.\"\n\n\"We ought to plan something,\" yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the\ntable as if she were getting into bed.\n\n\"All right,\" said Daisy. \"What'll we plan?\" She turned to me helplessly.\n\"What do people plan?\"\n\nBefore I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her\nlittle finger.\n\n\"Look!\" she complained. \"I hurt it.\"\n\nWe all looked--the knuckle was black and blue.\n\n\"You did it, Tom,\" she said accusingly. \"I know you didn't mean to\nbut you DID do it. That's what I get for marrying a brute of a man,\na great big hulking physical specimen of a----\"\n\n\"I hate that word hulking,\" objected Tom crossly, \"even in kidding.\"\n\n\"Hulking,\" insisted Daisy.\n\nSometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a\nbantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool\nas their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all\ndesire. They were here--and they accepted Tom and me, making only a\npolite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew\nthat presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too\nwould be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the\nWest where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its\nclose in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer\nnervous dread of the moment itself.\n\n\"You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,\" I confessed on my second glass\nof corky but rather impressive claret. \"Can't you talk about crops or\nsomething?\"\n\nI meant nothing in particular by this remark but it was taken up in an\nunexpected way.\n\n\"Civilization's going to pieces,\" broke out Tom violently.\n\"I've gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read\n'The Rise of the Coloured Empires' by this man Goddard?\"\n\n\"Why, no,\" I answered, rather surprised by his tone.\n\n\"Well, it's a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if\nwe don't look out the white race will be--will be utterly submerged.\nIt's all scientific stuff; it's been proved.\"\n\n\"Tom's getting very profound,\" said Daisy with an expression of\nunthoughtful sadness. \"He reads deep books with long words in them.\nWhat was that word we----\"\n\n\"Well, these books are all scientific,\" insisted Tom, glancing at her\nimpatiently. \"This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up to us\nwho are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have\ncontrol of things.\"\n\n\"We've got to beat them down,\" whispered Daisy, winking ferociously\ntoward the fervent sun.\n\n\"You ought to live in California--\" began Miss Baker but Tom\ninterrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.\n\n\"This idea is that we're Nordics. I am, and you are and you are\nand----\" After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a\nslight nod and she winked at me again. \"--and we've produced all the\nthings that go to make civilization--oh, science and art and all that.\nDo you see?\"\n\nThere was something pathetic in his concentration as if his complacency,\nmore acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. When, almost\nimmediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy\nseized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.\n\n\"I'll tell you a family secret,\" she whispered enthusiastically. \"It's\nabout the butler's nose. Do you want to hear about the butler's nose?\"\n\n\"That's why I came over tonight.\"\n\n\"Well, he wasn't always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for\nsome people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people.\nHe had to polish it from morning till night until finally it began to\naffect his nose----\"\n\n\"Things went from bad to worse,\" suggested Miss Baker.\n\n\"Yes. Things went from bad to worse until finally he had to give up\nhis position.\"\n\nFor a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon\nher glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as\nI listened--then the glow faded, each light deserting her with\nlingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.\n\nThe butler came back and murmured something close to Tom's ear\nwhereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair and without a word went\ninside. As if his absence quickened something within her Daisy leaned\nforward again, her voice glowing and singing.\n\n\"I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a--of a rose, an\nabsolute rose. Doesn't he?\" She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation.\n\"An absolute rose?\"\n\nThis was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only\nextemporizing but a stirring warmth flowed from her as if her\nheart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those\nbreathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the\ntable and excused herself and went into the house.\n\nMiss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of\nmeaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said \"Sh!\" in\na warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room\nbeyond and Miss Baker leaned forward, unashamed, trying to hear. The\nmurmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted\nexcitedly, and then ceased altogether.\n\n\"This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor----\" I said.\n\n\"Don't talk. I want to hear what happens.\"\n\n\"Is something happening?\" I inquired innocently.\n\n\"You mean to say you don't know?\" said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.\n\"I thought everybody knew.\"\n\n\"I don't.\"\n\n\"Why----\" she said hesitantly, \"Tom's got some woman in New York.\"\n\n\"Got some woman?\" I repeated blankly.\n\nMiss Baker nodded.\n\n\"She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner-time. Don't\nyou think?\"\n\nAlmost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of\na dress and the crunch of leather boots and Tom and Daisy were back\nat the table.\n\n\"It couldn't be helped!\" cried Daisy with tense gayety.\n\nShe sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me and\ncontinued: \"I looked outdoors for a minute and it's very romantic\noutdoors. There's a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale\ncome over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He's singing away----\" her\nvoice sang \"----It's romantic, isn't it, Tom?\"\n\n\"Very romantic,\" he said, and then miserably to me: \"If it's light enough\nafter dinner I want to take you down to the stables.\"\n\nThe telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her\nhead decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all\nsubjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the\nlast five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again,\npointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every\none and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn't guess what Daisy and Tom\nwere thinking but I doubt if even Miss Baker who seemed to have\nmastered a certain hardy skepticism was able utterly to put this fifth\nguest's shrill metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament\nthe situation might have seemed intriguing--my own instinct was to\ntelephone immediately for the police.\n\nThe horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss\nBaker, with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into\nthe library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while\ntrying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf I followed\nDaisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In\nits deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.\n\nDaisy took her face in her hands, as if feeling its lovely shape, and\nher eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent\nemotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some\nsedative questions about her little girl.\n\n\"We don't know each other very well, Nick,\" she said suddenly.\n\"Even if we are cousins. You didn't come to my wedding.\"\n\n\"I wasn't back from the war.\"\n\n\"That's true.\" She hesitated. \"Well, I've had a very bad time, Nick,\nand I'm pretty cynical about everything.\"\n\nEvidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn't say any more,\nand after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her\ndaughter.\n\n\"I suppose she talks, and--eats, and everything.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\" She looked at me absently. \"Listen, Nick; let me tell you what\nI said when she was born. Would you like to hear?\"\n\n\"Very much.\"\n\n\"It'll show you how I've gotten to feel about--things. Well, she was less\nthan an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether\nwith an utterly abandoned feeling and asked the nurse right away if it\nwas a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head\naway and wept. 'All right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope\nshe'll be a fool--that's the best thing a girl can be in this world,\na beautiful little fool.\"\n\n\"You see I think everything's terrible anyhow,\" she went on in a\nconvinced way. \"Everybody thinks so--the most advanced people. And I KNOW.\nI've been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.\"\nHer eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom's, and she\nlaughed with thrilling scorn. \"Sophisticated--God, I'm sophisticated!\"\n\nThe instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention,\nmy belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said.\nIt made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick\nof some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited,\nand sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk\non her lovely face as if she had asserted her membership in a rather\ndistinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.\n\n\nInside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker\nsat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from\nthe \"Saturday Evening Post\"--the words, murmurous and\nuninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamp-light,\nbright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair,\nglinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender\nmuscles in her arms.\n\nWhen we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.\n\n\"To be continued,\" she said, tossing the magazine on the table, \"in our\nvery next issue.\"\n\nHer body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she\nstood up.\n\n\"Ten o'clock,\" she remarked, apparently finding the time on the\nceiling. \"Time for this good girl to go to bed.\"\n\n\"Jordan's going to play in the tournament tomorrow,\" explained Daisy,\n\"over at Westchester.\"\n\n\"Oh,--you're JORdan Baker.\"\n\nI knew now why her face was familiar--its pleasing contemptuous\nexpression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of\nthe sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I\nhad heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story,\nbut what it was I had forgotten long ago.\n\n\"Good night,\" she said softly. \"Wake me at eight, won't you.\"\n\n\"If you'll get up.\"\n\n\"I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.\"\n\n\"Of course you will,\" confirmed Daisy. \"In fact I think I'll arrange\na marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I'll sort of--oh--fling you\ntogether. You know--lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push\nyou out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing----\"\n\n\"Good night,\" called Miss Baker from the stairs. \"I haven't heard a word.\"\n\n\"She's a nice girl,\" said Tom after a moment. \"They oughtn't to let her\nrun around the country this way.\"\n\n\"Who oughtn't to?\" inquired Daisy coldly.\n\n\"Her family.\"\n\n\"Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick's\ngoing to look after her, aren't you, Nick? She's going to spend lots of\nweek-ends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very\ngood for her.\"\n\nDaisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.\n\n\"Is she from New York?\" I asked quickly.\n\n\"From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our\nbeautiful white----\"\n\n\"Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?\"\ndemanded Tom suddenly.\n\n\"Did I?\" She looked at me. \"I can't seem to remember, but I think\nwe talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I'm sure we did. It sort of\ncrept up on us and first thing you know----\"\n\n\"Don't believe everything you hear, Nick,\" he advised me.\n\nI said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later\nI got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood side by\nside in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor Daisy\nperemptorily called \"Wait!\n\n\"I forgot to ask you something, and it's important. We heard you were\nengaged to a girl out West.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" corroborated Tom kindly. \"We heard that you were\nengaged.\"\n\n\"It's libel. I'm too poor.\"\n\n\"But we heard it,\" insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in\na flower-like way. \"We heard it from three people so it must be true.\"\n\nOf course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn't even vaguely\nengaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the\nreasons I had come east. You can't stop going with an old friend on\naccount of rumors and on the other hand I had no intention of being\nrumored into marriage.\n\nTheir interest rather touched me and made them less remotely\nrich--nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove\naway. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of\nthe house, child in arms--but apparently there were no such intentions\nin her head. As for Tom, the fact that he \"had some woman in New York\"\nwas really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book.\nSomething was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his\nsturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.\n\nAlready it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside\ngarages, where new red gas-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I\nreached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for\na while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown\noff, leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees and\na persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the\nfrogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the\nmoonlight and turning my head to watch it I saw that I was not\nalone--fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my\nneighbor's mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets\nregarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely\nmovements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested\nthat it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was\nhis of our local heavens.\n\nI decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and\nthat would do for an introduction. But I didn't call to him for he gave\na sudden intimation that he was content to be alone--he stretched out his\narms toward the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him\nI could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward--and\ndistinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away,\nthat might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby\nhe had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n\n\nAbout half way between West Egg and New York the motor-road hastily\njoins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to\nshrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of\nashes--a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and\nhills and grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and\nchimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcendent effort, of\nmen who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.\nOccasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives\nout a ghastly creak and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey\nmen swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud\nwhich screens their obscure operations from your sight.\n\nBut above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift\nendlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T.\nJ. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and\ngigantic--their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face but,\ninstead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a\nnonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to\nfatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself\ninto eternal blindness or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes,\ndimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain, brood on over\nthe solemn dumping ground.\n\nThe valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and\nwhen the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on\nwaiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an\nhour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute and it was\nbecause of this that I first met Tom Buchanan's mistress.\n\nThe fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. His\nacquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular\nrestaurants with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about,\nchatting with whomsoever he knew. Though I was curious to see her I\nhad no desire to meet her--but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on\nthe train one afternoon and when we stopped by the ashheaps he jumped\nto his feet and taking hold of my elbow literally forced me from the\ncar.\n\n\"We're getting off!\" he insisted. \"I want you to meet my girl.\"\n\nI think he'd tanked up a good deal at luncheon and his determination to\nhave my company bordered on violence. The supercilious assumption was that\non Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.\n\nI followed him over a low white-washed railroad fence and we walked\nback a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg's persistent\nstare. The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick\nsitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street\nministering to it and contiguous to absolutely nothing. One of the\nthree shops it contained was for rent and another was an all-night\nrestaurant approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a\ngarage--Repairs. GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars Bought and Sold--and I followed\nTom inside.\n\nThe interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the\ndust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had\noccurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind and that\nsumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead when the\nproprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands\non a piece of waste. He was a blonde, spiritless man, anaemic, and\nfaintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his\nlight blue eyes.\n\n\"Hello, Wilson, old man,\" said Tom, slapping him jovially on the\nshoulder. \"How's business?\"\n\n\"I can't complain,\" answered Wilson unconvincingly. \"When are you going\nto sell me that car?\"\n\n\"Next week; I've got my man working on it now.\"\n\n\"Works pretty slow, don't he?\"\n\n\"No, he doesn't,\" said Tom coldly. \"And if you feel that way about it,\nmaybe I'd better sell it somewhere else after all.\"\n\n\"I don't mean that,\" explained Wilson quickly. \"I just meant----\"\n\nHis voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage. Then\nI heard footsteps on a stairs and in a moment the thickish figure of a\nwoman blocked out the light from the office door. She was in the middle\nthirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously\nas some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue\ncrepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty but there was an\nimmediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body\nwere continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and walking through her\nhusband as if he were a ghost shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in\nthe eye. Then she wet her lips and without turning around spoke to her\nhusband in a soft, coarse voice:\n\n\"Get some chairs, why don't you, so somebody can sit down.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" agreed Wilson hurriedly and went toward the little office,\nmingling immediately with the cement color of the walls. A white ashen\ndust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in\nthe vicinity--except his wife, who moved close to Tom.\n\n\"I want to see you,\" said Tom intently. \"Get on the next train.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\n\"I'll meet you by the news-stand on the lower level.\"\n\nShe nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson\nemerged with two chairs from his office door.\n\nWe waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days before\nthe Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting\ntorpedoes in a row along the railroad track.\n\n\"Terrible place, isn't it,\" said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor\nEckleburg.\n\n\"Awful.\"\n\n\"It does her good to get away.\"\n\n\"Doesn't her husband object?\"\n\n\"Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He's so dumb\nhe doesn't know he's alive.\"\n\nSo Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York--or not\nquite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom\ndeferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be\non the train.\n\nShe had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin which stretched\ntight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in\nNew York. At the news-stand she bought a copy of \"Town Tattle\" and a\nmoving-picture magazine and, in the station drug store, some cold cream\nand a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive\nshe let four taxi cabs drive away before she selected a new one,\nlavender-colored with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the\nmass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she\nturned sharply from the window and leaning forward tapped on the\nfront glass.\n\n\"I want to get one of those dogs,\" she said earnestly. \"I want to get one\nfor the apartment. They're nice to have--a dog.\"\n\nWe backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John\nD. Rockefeller. In a basket, swung from his neck, cowered a dozen very\nrecent puppies of an indeterminate breed.\n\n\"What kind are they?\" asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly as he came to the\ntaxi-window.\n\n\"All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?\"\n\n\"I'd like to get one of those police dogs; I don't suppose you got that\nkind?\"\n\nThe man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew\none up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.\n\n\"That's no police dog,\" said Tom.\n\n\"No, it's not exactly a polICE dog,\" said the man with disappointment\nin his voice. \"It's more of an airedale.\" He passed his hand over the\nbrown wash-rag of a back. \"Look at that coat. Some coat. That's a dog\nthat'll never bother you with catching cold.\"\n\n\"I think it's cute,\" said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. \"How much is it?\"\n\n\"That dog?\" He looked at it admiringly. \"That dog will cost you ten\ndollars.\"\n\nThe airedale--undoubtedly there was an airedale concerned in it somewhere\nthough its feet were startlingly white--changed hands and settled down\ninto Mrs. Wilson's lap, where she fondled the weather-proof coat with\nrapture.\n\n\"Is it a boy or a girl?\" she asked delicately.\n\n\"That dog? That dog's a boy.\"\n\n\"It's a bitch,\" said Tom decisively. \"Here's your money. Go and buy ten\nmore dogs with it.\"\n\nWe drove over to Fifth Avenue, so warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the\nsummer Sunday afternoon that I wouldn't have been surprised to see a great\nflock of white sheep turn the corner.\n\n\"Hold on,\" I said, \"I have to leave you here.\"\n\n\"No, you don't,\" interposed Tom quickly. \"Myrtle'll be hurt if you don't \ncome up to the apartment. Won't you,\nMyrtle?\"\n\n\"Come on,\" she urged. \"I'll telephone my sister Catherine. She's said to\nbe very beautiful by people who ought to know.\"\n\n\"Well, I'd like to, but----\"\n\nWe went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds.\nAt 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of\napartment houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the\nneighborhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases\nand went haughtily in.\n\n\"I'm going to have the McKees come up,\" she announced as we rose in the\nelevator. \"And of course I got to call up my sister, too.\"\n\nThe apartment was on the top floor--a small living room, a small\ndining room, a small bedroom and a bath. The living room was crowded to\nthe doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it\nso that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of\nladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was\nan over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred\nrock. Looked at from a distance however the hen resolved itself\ninto a bonnet and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down\ninto the room. Several old copies of \"Town Tattle \"lay on the table\ntogether with a copy of \"Simon Called Peter\" and some of the small\nscandal magazines of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with\nthe dog. A reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and\nsome milk to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large\nhard dog biscuits--one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer\nof milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whiskey\nfrom a locked bureau door.\n\nI have been drunk just twice in my life and the second time was that\nafternoon so everything that happened has a dim hazy cast over it\nalthough until after eight o'clock the apartment was full of cheerful\nsun. Sitting on Tom's lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the\ntelephone; then there were no cigarettes and I went out to buy some at\nthe drug store on the corner. When I came back they had disappeared so\nI sat down discreetly in the living room and read a chapter of \"Simon\nCalled Peter\"--either it was terrible stuff or the whiskey distorted\nthings because it didn't make any sense to me.\n\nJust as Tom and Myrtle--after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called\neach other by our first names--reappeared, company commenced to arrive\nat the apartment door.\n\nThe sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty\nwith a solid sticky bob of red hair and a complexion powdered milky\nwhite. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more\nrakish angle but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the\nold alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about\nthere was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets\njingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary\nhaste and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered\nif she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated\nmy question aloud and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel.\n\nMr. McKee was a pale feminine man from the flat below. He had just\nshaved for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone and he\nwas most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He\ninformed me that he was in the \"artistic game\" and I gathered later\nthat he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs.\nWilson's mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His wife\nwas shrill, languid, handsome and horrible. She told me with pride\nthat her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven times\nsince they had been married.\n\nMrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before and was now\nattired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream colored chiffon, which\ngave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room.\nWith the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a\nchange. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage\nwas converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her\nassertions became more violently affected moment by moment and as she\nexpanded the room grew smaller around her until she seemed to be\nrevolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.\n\n\"My dear,\" she told her sister in a high mincing shout, \"most of these\nfellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I had a\nwoman up here last week to look at my feet and when she gave me the\nbill you'd of thought she had my appendicitus out.\"\n\n\"What was the name of the woman?\" asked Mrs. McKee.\n\n\"Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people's feet in their own\nhomes.\"\n\n\"I like your dress,\" remarked Mrs. McKee, \"I think it's adorable.\"\n\nMrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.\n\n\"It's just a crazy old thing,\" she said. \"I just slip it on sometimes when\nI don't care what I look like.\"\n\n\"But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,\" pursued\nMrs. McKee. \"If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could\nmake something of it.\"\n\nWe all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson who removed a strand of hair from\nover her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee\nregarded her intently with his head on one side and then moved his hand\nback and forth slowly in front of his face.\n\n\"I should change the light,\" he said after a moment. \"I'd like to bring\nout the modelling of the features. And I'd try to get hold of all the\nback hair.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't think of changing the light,\" cried Mrs. McKee. \"I think\nit's----\"\n\nHer husband said \"SH!\" and we all looked at the subject again whereupon\nTom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.\n\n\"You McKees have something to drink,\" he said. \"Get some more ice and\nmineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.\"\n\n\"I told that boy about the ice.\" Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair\nat the shiftlessness of the lower orders. \"These people! You have to keep\nafter them all the time.\"\n\nShe looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the\ndog, kissed it with ecstasy and swept into the kitchen, implying that\na dozen chefs awaited her orders there.\n\n\"I've done some nice things out on Long Island,\" asserted Mr. McKee.\n\nTom looked at him blankly.\n\n\"Two of them we have framed downstairs.\"\n\n\"Two what?\" demanded Tom.\n\n\"Two studies. One of them I call 'Montauk Point--the Gulls,' and the\nother I call 'Montauk Point--the Sea.' \"\n\nThe sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.\n\n\"Do you live down on Long Island, too?\" she inquired.\n\n\"I live at West Egg.\"\n\n\"Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named\nGatsby's. Do you know him?\"\n\n\"I live next door to him.\"\n\n\"Well, they say he's a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm's. That's\nwhere all his money comes from.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"I'm scared of him. I'd hate to have him get anything on me.\"\n\nThis absorbing information about my neighbor was interrupted by\nMrs. McKee's pointing suddenly at Catherine:\n\n\"Chester, I think you could do something with HER,\" she broke out,\nbut Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way and turned his attention\nto Tom.\n\n\"I'd like to do more work on Long Island if I could get the entry. All\nI ask is that they should give me a start.\"\n\n\"Ask Myrtle,\" said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as\nMrs. Wilson entered with a tray. \"She'll give you a letter of\nintroduction, won't you, Myrtle?\"\n\n\"Do what?\" she asked, startled.\n\n\"You'll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can\ndo some studies of him.\" His lips moved silently for a moment as he\ninvented. \" 'George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,' or something like\nthat.\"\n\n\nCatherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear: \"Neither of them\ncan stand the person they're married to.\"\n\n\"Can't they?\"\n\n\"Can't STAND them.\" She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. \"What I say is,\nwhy go on living with them if they can't stand them? If I was them I'd get\na divorce and get married to each other right away.\"\n\n\"Doesn't she like Wilson either?\"\n\nThe answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle who had overheard\nthe question and it was violent and obscene.\n\n\"You see?\" cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again.\n\"It's really his wife that's keeping them apart. She's a Catholic and\nthey don't believe in divorce.\"\n\nDaisy was not a Catholic and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness\nof the lie.\n\n\"When they do get married,\" continued Catherine, \"they're going west to\nlive for a while until it blows over.\"\n\n\"It'd be more discreet to go to Europe.\"\n\n\"Oh, do you like Europe?\" she exclaimed surprisingly. \"I just got back\nfrom Monte Carlo.\"\n\n\"Really.\"\n\n\"Just last year. I went over there with another girl.\"\n\n\"Stay long?\"\n\n\"No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way of Marseilles.\nWe had over twelve hundred dollars when we started but we got gypped\nout of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had an awful time\ngetting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town!\"\n\nThe late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue\nhoney of the Mediterranean--then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me\nback into the room.\n\n\"I almost made a mistake, too,\" she declared vigorously. \"I almost\nmarried a little kyke who'd been after me for years. I knew he was\nbelow me. Everybody kept saying to me: 'Lucille, that man's way below\nyou!' But if I hadn't met Chester, he'd of got me sure.\"\n\n\"Yes, but listen,\" said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down,\n\"at least you didn't marry him.\"\n\n\"I know I didn't.\"\n\n\"Well, I married him,\" said Myrtle, ambiguously. \"And that's the\ndifference between your case and mine.\"\n\n\"Why did you, Myrtle?\" demanded Catherine. \"Nobody forced you to.\"\n\nMyrtle considered.\n\n\"I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,\" she said finally.\n\"I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn't fit to lick\nmy shoe.\"\n\n\"You were crazy about him for a while,\" said Catherine.\n\n\"Crazy about him!\" cried Myrtle incredulously. \"Who said I was crazy about\nhim? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man\nthere.\"\n\nShe pointed suddenly at me, and every one looked at me accusingly.\nI tried to show by my expression that I had played no part in her past.\n\n\"The only CRAZY I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made a\nmistake. He borrowed somebody's best suit to get married in and never\neven told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he was out.\nShe looked around to see who was listening: \" 'Oh, is that your suit?' I \nsaid.\n'This is the first I ever heard about it.' But I gave it to him and then I \nlay down\nand cried to beat the band all afternoon.\"\n\n\"She really ought to get away from him,\" resumed Catherine to me.\n\"They've been living over that garage for eleven years. And Tom's the\nfirst sweetie she ever had.\"\n\nThe bottle of whiskey--a second one--was now in constant demand by all\npresent, excepting Catherine who \"felt just as good on nothing at all.\"\nTom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches,\nwhich were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted to get out and walk\neastward toward the park through the soft twilight but each time I tried\nto go I became entangled in some wild strident argument which pulled me\nback, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city our line of\nyellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the\ncasual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and\nwondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled\nby the inexhaustible variety of life.\n\nMyrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath\npoured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.\n\n\"It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the\nlast ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my\nsister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather\nshoes and I couldn't keep my eyes off him but every time he looked at\nme I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head.\nWhen we came into the station he was next to me and his white\nshirt-front pressed against my arm--and so I told him I'd have to call\na policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into\na taxi with him I didn't hardly know I wasn't getting into a subway\ntrain. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was 'You can't live\nforever, you can't live forever.' \"\n\nShe turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial\nlaughter.\n\n\"My dear,\" she cried, \"I'm going to give you this dress as soon as I'm\nthrough with it. I've got to get another one tomorrow. I'm going to\nmake a list of all the things I've got to get. A massage and a wave\nand a collar for the dog and one of those cute little ash-trays where\nyou touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother's\ngrave that'll last all summer. I got to write down a list so I won't\nforget all the things I got to do.\"\n\nIt was nine o'clock--almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch\nand found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists\nclenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out my\nhandkerchief I wiped from his cheek the remains of the spot of dried\nlather that had worried me all the afternoon.\n\nThe little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through\nthe smoke and from time to time groaning faintly. People disappeared,\nreappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other,\nsearched for each other, found each other a few feet away. Some time\ntoward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face\ndiscussing in impassioned voices whether Mrs. Wilson had any right to\nmention Daisy's name.\n\n\"Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!\" shouted Mrs. Wilson. \"I'll say it whenever I want\nto! Daisy! Dai----\"\n\nMaking a short deft movement Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his\nopen hand.\n\nThen there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women's\nvoices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of\npain. Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the door.\nWhen he had gone half way he turned around and stared at the scene--his\nwife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and\nthere among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and the\ndespairing figure on the couch bleeding fluently and trying to spread\na copy of \"Town Tattle\" over the tapestry scenes of Versailles.\nThen Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the door. Taking my hat from\nthe chandelier I followed.\n\n\"Come to lunch some day,\" he suggested, as we groaned down in the\nelevator.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Anywhere.\"\n\n\"Keep your hands off the lever,\" snapped the elevator boy.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. McKee with dignity, \"I didn't know I was\ntouching it.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I agreed, \"I'll be glad to.\"\n\n. . . I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the\nsheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.\n\n\"Beauty and the Beast . . . Loneliness . . . Old Grocery Horse . . .\nBrook'n Bridge . . . .\"\n\nThen I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the Pennsylvania\nStation, staring at the morning \"Tribune\" and waiting for the four\no'clock train.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n\n\nThere was music from my neighbor's house through the summer nights. In\nhis blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the\nwhisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the\nafternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft or\ntaking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats\nslit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of\nfoam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties\nto and from the city, between nine in the morning and long past\nmidnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to\nmeet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants including an extra\ngardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers\nand garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.\n\nEvery Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer\nin New York--every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back\ndoor in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the\nkitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an\nhour, if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler's\nthumb.\n\nAt least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several\nhundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas\ntree of Gatsby's enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with\nglistening hors-d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of\nharlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold.\nIn the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked\nwith gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of\nhis female guests were too young to know one from another.\n\nBy seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived--no thin five-piece affair\nbut a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and\ncornets and piccolos and low and high drums. The last swimmers have\ncome in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from\nNew York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and\nsalons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors and hair shorn in\nstrange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The\nbar is in full swing and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the\ngarden outside until the air is alive with chatter and laughter and\ncasual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and\nenthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names.\n\nThe lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and\nnow the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music and the opera of\nvoices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier, minute by minute,\nspilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups\nchange more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the\nsame breath--already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave\nhere and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp,\njoyous moment the center of a group and then excited with triumph\nglide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the\nconstantly changing light.\n\nSuddenly one of these gypsies in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out\nof the air, dumps it down for courage and moving her hands like\nFrisco dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; the\norchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her and there is a\nburst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda\nGray's understudy from the \"Follies.\" The party has begun.\n\nI believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby's house I was one of\nthe few guests who had actually been invited. People were not\ninvited--they went there. They got into automobiles which bore them out\nto Long Island and somehow they ended up at Gatsby's door. Once there\nthey were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby and after that they\nconducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with\namusement parks. Sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby\nat all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own\nticket of admission.\n\nI had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of robin's egg\nblue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly\nformal note from his employer--the honor would be entirely Gatsby's, it\nsaid, if I would attend his \"little party\" that night. He had\nseen me several times and had intended to call on me long before\nbut a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it--signed\nJay Gatsby in a majestic hand.\n\nDressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after\nseven and wandered around rather ill-at-ease among swirls and eddies\nof people I didn't know--though here and there was a face I had noticed\non the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number of young\nEnglishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry\nand all talking in low earnest voices to solid and prosperous\nAmericans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or\ninsurance or automobiles. They were, at least, agonizingly aware of the\neasy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few\nwords in the right key.\n\nAs soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host but the two or\nthree people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an\namazed way and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements\nthat I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table--the only place\nin the garden where a single man could linger without looking\npurposeless and alone.\n\nI was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when\nJordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble\nsteps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest\ndown into the garden.\n\nWelcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone\nbefore I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passers-by.\n\n\"Hello!\" I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturally\nloud across the garden.\n\n\"I thought you might be here,\" she responded absently as I came up.\n\"I remembered you lived next door to----\"\n\nShe held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she'd take care\nof me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses\nwho stopped at the foot of the steps.\n\n\"Hello!\" they cried together. \"Sorry you didn't win.\"\n\nThat was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week\nbefore.\n\n\"You don't know who we are,\" said one of the girls in yellow, \"but we\nmet you here about a month ago.\"\n\n\"You've dyed your hair since then,\" remarked Jordan, and I started\nbut the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the\npremature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer's\nbasket. With Jordan's slender golden arm resting in mine we descended\nthe steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated at\nus through the twilight and we sat down at a table with the two girls in\nyellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble.\n\n\"Do you come to these parties often?\" inquired Jordan of the girl\nbeside her.\n\n\"The last one was the one I met you at,\" answered the girl, in an alert,\nconfident voice. She turned to her companion: \"Wasn't it for you,\nLucille?\"\n\nIt was for Lucille, too.\n\n\"I like to come,\" Lucille said. \"I never care what I do, so I always have\na good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked\nme my name and address--inside of a week I got a package from Croirier's\nwith a new evening gown in it.\"\n\n\"Did you keep it?\" asked Jordan.\n\n\"Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the\nbust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two\nhundred and sixty-five dollars.\"\n\n\"There's something funny about a fellow that'll do a thing like that,\"\nsaid the other girl eagerly. \"He doesn't want any trouble with ANYbody.\"\n\n\"Who doesn't?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Gatsby. Somebody told me----\"\n\nThe two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.\n\n\"Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.\"\n\nA thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and\nlistened eagerly.\n\n\"I don't think it's so much THAT,\" argued Lucille skeptically; \"it's\nmore that he was a German spy during the war.\"\n\nOne of the men nodded in confirmation.\n\n\"I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in\nGermany,\" he assured us positively.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said the first girl, \"it couldn't be that, because he was in\nthe American army during the war.\" As our credulity switched back to\nher she leaned forward with enthusiasm. \"You look at him sometimes when\nhe thinks nobody's looking at him. I'll bet he killed a man.\"\n\nShe narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned and\nlooked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic speculation he\ninspired that there were whispers about him from those who found little\nthat it was necessary to whisper about in this world.\n\nThe first supper--there would be another one after midnight--was now\nbeing served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party who were\nspread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were\nthree married couples and Jordan's escort, a persistent undergraduate\ngiven to violent innuendo and obviously under the impression\nthat sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person\nto a greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling this party\nhad preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the\nfunction of representing the staid nobility of the countryside--East\nEgg condescending to West Egg, and carefully on guard against its\nspectroscopic gayety.\n\n\"Let's get out,\" whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and\ninappropriate half hour. \"This is much too polite for me.\"\n\nWe got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host--I\nhad never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The\nundergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.\n\nThe bar, where we glanced first, was crowded but Gatsby was not there.\nShe couldn't find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn't on the\nveranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked\ninto a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and\nprobably transported complete from some ruin overseas.\n\nA stout, middle-aged man with enormous owl-eyed spectacles was\nsitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with\nunsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he\nwheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.\n\n\"What do you think?\" he demanded impetuously.\n\n\"About what?\"\n\nHe waved his hand toward the book-shelves.\n\n\"About that. As a matter of fact you needn't bother to ascertain. I\nascertained. They're real.\"\n\n\"The books?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Absolutely real--have pages and everything. I thought they'd be a nice\ndurable cardboard. Matter of fact, they're absolutely real. Pages\nand--Here! Lemme show you.\"\n\nTaking our skepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and\nreturned with Volume One of the \"Stoddard Lectures.\"\n\n\"See!\" he cried triumphantly. \"It's a bona fide piece of printed matter.\nIt fooled me. This fella's a regular Belasco. It's a triumph. What\nthoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop too--didn't cut the pages.\nBut what do you want? What do you expect?\"\n\nHe snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf\nmuttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable\nto collapse.\n\n\"Who brought you?\" he demanded. \"Or did you just come? I was brought.\nMost people were brought.\"\n\nJordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully without answering.\n\n\"I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,\" he continued. \"Mrs. Claud\nRoosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I've\nbeen drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me\nup to sit in a library.\"\n\n\"Has it?\"\n\n\"A little bit, I think. I can't tell yet. I've only been here\nan hour. Did I tell you about the books? They're real. They're----\"\n\n\"You told us.\"\n\nWe shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.\n\nThere was dancing now on the canvas in the garden, old men pushing\nyoung girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples\nholding each other tortuously, fashionably and keeping in the\ncorners--and a great number of single girls dancing individualistically\nor relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or\nthe traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had\nsung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz and between\nthe numbers people were doing \"stunts\" all over the garden, while happy\nvacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage\n\"twins\"--who turned out to be the girls in yellow--did a baby act in\ncostume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger bowls.\nThe moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of\nsilver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the\nbanjoes on the lawn.\n\nI was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of\nabout my age and a rowdy little girl who gave way upon the slightest\nprovocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now. I\nhad taken two finger bowls of champagne and the scene had changed\nbefore my eyes into something significant, elemental and profound.\n\nAt a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.\n\n\"Your face is familiar,\" he said, politely. \"Weren't you in the Third\nDivision during the war?\"\n\n\"Why, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-Gun Battalion.\"\n\n\"I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I'd\nseen you somewhere before.\"\n\nWe talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France.\nEvidently he lived in this vicinity for he told me that he had just\nbought a hydroplane and was going to try it out in the morning.\n\n\"Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.\"\n\n\"What time?\"\n\n\"Any time that suits you best.\"\n\nIt was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around\nand smiled.\n\n\"Having a gay time now?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Much better.\" I turned again to my new acquaintance. \"This is an unusual\nparty for me. I haven't even seen the host. I live over there----\" I waved\nmy hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, \"and this man Gatsby sent\nover his chauffeur with an invitation.\"\n\nFor a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.\n\n\"I'm Gatsby,\" he said suddenly.\n\n\"What!\" I exclaimed. \"Oh, I beg your pardon.\"\n\n\"I thought you knew, old sport. I'm afraid I'm not a very good host.\"\n\nHe smiled understandingly--much more than understandingly. It was\none of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance\nin it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or\nseemed to face--the whole external world for an instant, and then\nconcentrated on YOU with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It\nunderstood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in\nyou as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it\nhad precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to\nconvey. Precisely at that point it vanished--and I was looking at an\nelegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate\nformality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he\nintroduced himself I'd got a strong impression that he was picking his\nwords with care.\n\nAlmost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler\nhurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on\nthe wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us\nin turn.\n\n\"If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,\" he urged me.\n\"Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.\"\n\nWhen he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan--constrained to assure her\nof my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and\ncorpulent person in his middle years.\n\n\"Who is he?\" I demanded. \"Do you know?\"\n\n\"He's just a man named Gatsby.\"\n\n\"Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?\"\n\n\"Now YOU're started on the subject,\" she answered with a wan smile.\n\"Well,--he told me once he was an Oxford man.\"\n\nA dim background started to take shape behind him but at her\nnext remark it faded away.\n\n\"However, I don't believe it.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she insisted, \"I just don't think he went there.\"\n\nSomething in her tone reminded me of the other girl's \"I think\nhe killed a man,\" and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I\nwould have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang\nfrom the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York.\nThat was comprehensible. But young men didn't--at least in my provincial\ninexperience I believed they didn't--drift coolly out of nowhere and buy\na palace on Long Island Sound.\n\n\"Anyhow he gives large parties,\" said Jordan, changing the subject\nwith an urbane distaste for the concrete. \"And I like large parties.\nThey're so intimate. At small parties there isn't any privacy.\"\n\nThere was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader\nrang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he cried. \"At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are\ngoing to play for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff's latest work which attracted\nso much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers\nyou know there was a big sensation.\" He smiled with jovial condescension\nand added \"Some sensation!\" whereupon everybody laughed.\n\n\"The piece is known,\" he concluded lustily, \"as 'Vladimir Tostoff's\nJazz History of the World.' \"\n\nThe nature of Mr. Tostoff's composition eluded me, because just as\nit began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps\nand looking from one group to another with approving eyes.\nHis tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and\nhis short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day. I could\nsee nothing sinister about him. I wondered if the fact that he was\nnot drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed\nto me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased.\nWhen the \"Jazz History of the World\" was over girls were putting\ntheir heads on men's shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were\nswooning backward playfully into men's arms, even into groups knowing\nthat some one would arrest their falls--but no one swooned backward on\nGatsby and no French bob touched Gatsby's shoulder and no singing\nquartets were formed with Gatsby's head for one link.\n\n\"I beg your pardon.\"\n\nGatsby's butler was suddenly standing beside us.\n\n\"Miss Baker?\" he inquired. \"I beg your pardon but Mr. Gatsby would like\nto speak to you alone.\"\n\n\"With me?\" she exclaimed in surprise.\n\n\"Yes, madame.\"\n\nShe got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment,\nand followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore\nher evening dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes--there\nwas a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to\nwalk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.\n\nI was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and\nintriguing sounds had issued from a long many-windowed room which\noverhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan's undergraduate who was now\nengaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who\nimplored me to join him, I went inside.\n\nThe large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was\nplaying the piano and beside her stood a tall, red haired young lady\nfrom a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of\nchampagne and during the course of her song she had decided ineptly\nthat everything was very very sad--she was not only singing, she was\nweeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with\ngasping broken sobs and then took up the lyric again in a quavering\nsoprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks--not freely, however, for when\nthey came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an\ninky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. A\nhumorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face\nwhereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair and went off into\na deep vinous sleep.\n\n\"She had a fight with a man who says he's her husband,\" explained a\ngirl at my elbow.\n\nI looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights\nwith men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan's party, the quartet\nfrom East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was\ntalking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife after\nattempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent\nway broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks--at intervals she\nappeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed \"You\npromised!\" into his ear.\n\nThe reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall was at\npresent occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant\nwives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised\nvoices.\n\n\"Whenever he sees I'm having a good time he wants to go home.\"\n\n\"Never heard anything so selfish in my life.\"\n\n\"We're always the first ones to leave.\"\n\n\"So are we.\"\n\n\"Well, we're almost the last tonight,\" said one of the men sheepishly.\n\"The orchestra left half an hour ago.\"\n\nIn spite of the wives' agreement that such malevolence was beyond\ncredibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were\nlifted kicking into the night.\n\nAs I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and\nJordan Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last word\nto her but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into\nformality as several people approached him to say goodbye.\n\nJordan's party were calling impatiently to her from the porch but she\nlingered for a moment to shake hands.\n\n\"I've just heard the most amazing thing,\" she whispered. \"How long were\nwe in there?\"\n\n\"Why,--about an hour.\"\n\n\"It was--simply amazing,\" she repeated abstractedly. \"But I swore\nI wouldn't tell it and here I am tantalizing you.\" She yawned\ngracefully in my face. \"Please come and see me. . . . Phone book.\n. . . Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard. . . . My aunt. . . .\"\nShe was hurrying off as she talked--her brown hand waved a\njaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door.\n\nRather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I\njoined the last of Gatsby's guests who were clustered around him. I\nwanted to explain that I'd hunted for him early in the evening and to\napologize for not having known him in the garden.\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" he enjoined me eagerly. \"Don't give it another\nthought, old sport.\" The familiar expression held no more familiarity\nthan the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. \"And don't forget\nwe're going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning at nine o'clock.\"\n\nThen the butler, behind his shoulder:\n\n\"Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.\"\n\n\"All right, in a minute. Tell them I'll be right there. . . . good\nnight.\"\n\n\"Good night.\"\n\n\"Good night.\" He smiled--and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant\nsignificance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired\nit all the time. \"Good night, old sport. . . . Good night.\"\n\nBut as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over.\nFifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and\ntumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side up but\nviolently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coup\u00e9 which had left Gatsby's\ndrive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the\ndetachment of the wheel which was now getting considerable attention from\nhalf a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as they had left their cars\nblocking the road a harsh discordant din from those in the rear had been\naudible for some time and added to the already violent confusion of\nthe scene.\n\nA man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in\nthe middle of the road, looking from the car to the tire and from the\ntire to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.\n\n\"See!\" he explained. \"It went in the ditch.\"\n\nThe fact was infinitely astonishing to him--and I recognized first the\nunusual quality of wonder and then the man--it was the late patron of\nGatsby's library.\n\n\"How'd it happen?\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I know nothing whatever about mechanics,\" he said decisively.\n\n\"But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?\"\n\n\"Don't ask me,\" said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter.\n\"I know very little about driving--next to nothing. It happened,\nand that's all I know.\"\n\n\"Well, if you're a poor driver you oughtn't to try driving at night.\"\n\n\"But I wasn't even trying,\" he explained indignantly, \"I wasn't even\ntrying.\"\n\nAn awed hush fell upon the bystanders.\n\n\"Do you want to commit suicide?\"\n\n\"You're lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even TRYing!\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" explained the criminal. \"I wasn't driving. There's\nanother man in the car.\"\n\nThe shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained\n\"Ah-h-h!\" as the door of the coup\u00e9 swung slowly open. The crowd--it was\nnow a crowd--stepped back involuntarily and when the door had opened wide\nthere was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale\ndangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the\nground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.\n\nBlinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant\ngroaning of the horns the apparition stood swaying for a moment before\nhe perceived the man in the duster.\n\n\"Wha's matter?\" he inquired calmly. \"Did we run outa gas?\"\n\n\"Look!\"\n\nHalf a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel--he stared\nat it for a moment and then looked upward as though he suspected that\nit had dropped from the sky.\n\n\"It came off,\" some one explained.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"At first I din' notice we'd stopped.\"\n\nA pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders\nhe remarked in a determined voice:\n\n\"Wonder'ff tell me where there's a gas'line station?\"\n\nAt least a dozen men, some of them little better off than he was,\nexplained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical\nbond.\n\n\"Back out,\" he suggested after a moment. \"Put her in reverse.\"\n\n\"But the WHEEL'S off!\"\n\nHe hesitated.\n\n\"No harm in trying,\" he said.\n\nThe caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and\ncut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a moon\nwas shining over Gatsby's house, making the night fine as before and\nsurviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. A\nsudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great\ndoors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host who\nstood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.\n\n\nReading over what I have written so far I see I have given the\nimpression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all\nthat absorbed me. On the contrary they were merely casual events in a\ncrowded summer and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less\nthan my personal affairs.\n\nMost of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my shadow\nwestward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the\nProbity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their\nfirst names and lunched with them in dark crowded restaurants on\nlittle pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I even had a short\naffair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the\naccounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my\ndirection so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow\nquietly away.\n\nI took dinner usually at the Yale Club--for some reason it was the\ngloomiest event of my day--and then I went upstairs to the library and\nstudied investments and securities for a conscientious hour.\nThere were generally a few rioters around but they never came into the\nlibrary so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was\nmellow I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel\nand over Thirty-third Street to the Pennsylvania Station.\n\nI began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night\nand the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and\nmachines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and\npick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few\nminutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever\nknow or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their\napartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled\nback at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the\nenchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes,\nand felt it in others--poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows\nwaiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner--young clerks\nin the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.\n\nAgain at eight o'clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were five\ndeep with throbbing taxi cabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a\nsinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited,\nand voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted\ncigarettes outlined unintelligible gestures inside. Imagining that\nI, too, was hurrying toward gayety and sharing their intimate\nexcitement, I wished them well.\n\nFor a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found\nher again. At first I was flattered to go places with her because she\nwas a golf champion and every one knew her name. Then it was\nsomething more. I wasn't actually in love, but I felt a sort of\ntender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the\nworld concealed something--most affectations conceal something\neventually, even though they don't in the beginning--and one day I found\nwhat it was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she\nleft a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied\nabout it--and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded\nme that night at Daisy's. At her first big golf tournament there was a\nrow that nearly reached the newspapers--a suggestion that she had moved\nher ball from a bad lie in the semi-final round. The thing approached\nthe proportions of a scandal--then died away. A caddy retracted his\nstatement and the only other witness admitted that he might have been\nmistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.\n\nJordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw\nthat this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence\nfrom a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest.\nShe wasn't able to endure being at a disadvantage, and given this\nunwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she\nwas very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the\nworld and yet satisfy the demands of her hard jaunty body.\n\nIt made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never\nblame deeply--I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that\nsame house party that we had a curious conversation about driving a\ncar. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our\nfender flicked a button on one man's coat.\n\n\"You're a rotten driver,\" I protested. \"Either you ought to be more\ncareful or you oughtn't to drive at all.\"\n\n\"I am careful.\"\n\n\"No, you're not.\"\n\n\"Well, other people are,\" she said lightly.\n\n\"What's that got to do with it?\"\n\n\"They'll keep out of my way,\" she insisted. \"It takes two to make an\naccident.\"\n\n\"Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.\"\n\n\"I hope I never will,\" she answered. \"I hate careless people. That's why\nI like you.\"\n\nHer grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had\ndeliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved\nher. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes\non my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of\nthat tangle back home. I'd been writing letters once a week and signing\nthem: \"Love, Nick,\" and all I could think of was how, when that certain\ngirl played tennis, a faint mustache of perspiration appeared on her\nupper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be\ntactfully broken off before I was free.\n\nEvery one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and\nthis is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n\n\nOn Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages along shore\nthe world and its mistress returned to Gatsby's house and twinkled\nhilariously on his lawn.\n\n\"He's a bootlegger,\" said the young ladies, moving somewhere between\nhis cocktails and his flowers. \"One time he killed a man who had found out\nthat he was nephew to von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil.\nReach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there crystal\nglass.\"\n\nOnce I wrote down on the empty spaces of a time-table the names\nof those who came to Gatsby's house that summer. It is an old time-table\nnow, disintegrating at its folds and headed \"This schedule in effect\nJuly 5th, 1922.\" But I can still read the grey names and they will give\nyou a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted\nGatsby's hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing\nwhatever about him.\n\nFrom East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches and a\nman named Bunsen whom I knew at Yale and Doctor Webster Civet who\nwas drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie\nVoltaires and a whole clan named Blackbuck who always gathered in a\ncorner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near.\nAnd the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr.\nChrystie's wife) and Edgar Beaver, whose hair they say turned\ncotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.\n\nClarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only\nonce, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named\nEtty in the garden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles\nand the O. R. P. Schraeders and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of\nGeorgia and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there\nthree days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the\ngravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett's automobile ran over his right\nhand. The Dancies came too and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over\nsixty, and Maurice A. Flink and the Hammerheads and Beluga the\ntobacco importer and Beluga's girls.\n\nFrom West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and\nCecil Schoen and Gulick the state senator and Newton Orchid who\ncontrolled Films Par Excellence and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don\nS. Schwartze (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the\nmovies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G.\nEarl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife.\nDa Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B.\n(\"Rot-Gut\") Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly--they came to\ngamble and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was\ncleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably\nnext day.\n\nA man named Klipspringer was there so often and so long that he became\nknown as \"the boarder\"--I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical\npeople there were Gus Waize and Horace O'Donavan and Lester Meyer and\nGeorge Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes\nand the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the\nCorrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W.\nBelcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry\nL. Palmetto who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train\nin Times Square.\n\nBenny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite\nthe same ones in physical person but they were so identical one with\nanother that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have\nforgotten their names--Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela or Gloria\nor Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names\nof flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American\ncapitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves to\nbe.\n\nIn addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O'Brien came\nthere at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer who had\nhis nose shot off in the war and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his\nfianc\u00e9e, and Ardita Fitz-Peters, and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of the\nAmerican Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip with a man reputed to be her\nchauffeur, and a prince of something whom we called Duke and whose name,\nif I ever knew it, I have forgotten.\n\nAll these people came to Gatsby's house in the summer.\n\n\nAt nine o'clock, one morning late in July Gatsby's gorgeous car\nlurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody\nfrom its three noted horn. It was the first time he had called on me\nthough I had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane,\nand, at his urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach.\n\n\"Good morning, old sport. You're having lunch with me today and I\nthought we'd ride up together.\"\n\nHe was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that\nresourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American--that comes,\nI suppose, with the absence of lifting work or rigid sitting in youth\nand, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games.\nThis quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in\nthe shape of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a\ntapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.\n\nHe saw me looking with admiration at his car.\n\n\"It's pretty, isn't it, old sport.\" He jumped off to give me a better\nview. \"Haven't you ever seen it before?\"\n\nI'd seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream color, bright\nwith nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with\ntriumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a\nlabyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind\nmany layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory we started\nto town.\n\nI had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and\nfound, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first\nimpression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had\ngradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate\nroadhouse next door.\n\nAnd then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn't reached West Egg\nvillage before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished\nand slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-colored\nsuit.\n\n\"Look here, old sport,\" he broke out surprisingly. \"What's your opinion\nof me, anyhow?\"\n\nA little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which\nthat question deserves.\n\n\"Well, I'm going to tell you something about my life,\" he interrupted.\n\"I don't want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you\nhear.\"\n\nSo he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavored conversation in\nhis halls.\n\n\"I'll tell you God's truth.\" His right hand suddenly ordered divine\nretribution to stand by. \"I am the son of some wealthy people in the\nmiddle-west--all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at\nOxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years.\nIt is a family tradition.\"\n\nHe looked at me sideways--and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was\nlying. He hurried the phrase \"educated at Oxford,\" or swallowed it or\nchoked on it as though it had bothered him before. And with this doubt\nhis whole statement fell to pieces and I wondered if there wasn't\nsomething a little sinister about him after all.\n\n\"What part of the middle-west?\" I inquired casually.\n\n\"San Francisco.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\n\"My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.\"\n\nHis voice was solemn as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan\nstill haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg\nbut a glance at him convinced me otherwise.\n\n\"After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of\nEurope--Paris, Venice, Rome--collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting\nbig game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to\nforget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.\"\n\nWith an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very\nphrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a\nturbaned \"character\" leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a\ntiger through the Bois de Boulogne.\n\n\"Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief and I tried very\nhard to die but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a\ncommission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I\ntook two machine-gun detachments so far forward that there was a half\nmile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn't advance. We\nstayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty men with\nsixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last they found\nthe insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead. I was\npromoted to be a major and every Allied government gave me a\ndecoration--even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic\nSea!\"\n\nLittle Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them--with\nhis smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro's troubled history and\nsympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It\nappreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had\nelicited this tribute from Montenegro's warm little heart. My\nincredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming\nhastily through a dozen magazines.\n\nHe reached in his pocket and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon, fell\ninto my palm.\n\n\"That's the one from Montenegro.\"\n\nTo my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look.\n\n_Orderi di Danilo_, ran the circular legend, _Montenegro, Nicolas Rex_.\n\n\"Turn it.\"\n\n_Major Jay Gatsby_, I read, _For Valour Extraordinary_.\n\n\"Here's another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It was\ntaken in Trinity Quad--the man on my left is now the Earl of Dorcaster.\"\n\nIt was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an\narchway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby,\nlooking a little, not much, younger--with a cricket bat in his hand.\n\nThen it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace\non the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with\ntheir crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.\n\n\"I'm going to make a big request of you today,\" he said, pocketing his\nsouvenirs with satisfaction, \"so I thought you ought to know something\nabout me. I didn't want you to think I was just some nobody. You see,\nI usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there\ntrying to forget the sad thing that happened to me.\" He hesitated.\n\"You'll hear about it this afternoon.\"\n\n\"At lunch?\"\n\n\"No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you're taking Miss Baker\nto tea.\"\n\n\"Do you mean you're in love with Miss Baker?\"\n\n\"No, old sport, I'm not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak\nto you about this matter.\"\n\nI hadn't the faintest idea what \"this matter\" was, but I was more\nannoyed than interested. I hadn't asked Jordan to tea in order to discuss\nMr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something utterly\nfantastic and for a moment I was sorry I'd ever set foot upon his\noverpopulated lawn.\n\nHe wouldn't say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared\nthe city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of\nred-belted ocean-going ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with\nthe dark, undeserted saloons of the faded gilt nineteen-hundreds. Then\nthe valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a glimpse\nof Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we\nwent by.\n\nWith fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half\nAstoria--only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the\nelevated I heard the familiar \"jug--jug--SPAT!\" of a motor cycle, and a\nfrantic policeman rode alongside.\n\n\"All right, old sport,\" called Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a white\ncard from his wallet he waved it before the man's eyes.\n\n\"Right you are,\" agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. \"Know you next\ntime, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse ME!\"\n\n\"What was that?\" I inquired.  \"The picture of Oxford?\"\n\n\"I was able to do the commissioner a favor once, and he sends me a\nChristmas card every year.\"\n\nOver the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a\nconstant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the\nriver in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of\nnon-olfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always\nthe city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the\nmystery and the beauty in the world.\n\nA dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two\ncarriages with drawn blinds and by more cheerful carriages for\nfriends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short\nupper lips of south-eastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of\nGatsby's splendid car was included in their somber holiday. As we\ncrossed Blackwell's Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white\nchauffeur, in which sat three modish Negroes, two bucks and a girl. I\nlaughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in\nhaughty rivalry.\n\n\"Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge,\" I thought;\n\"anything at all. . . .\"\n\nEven Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.\n\n\nRoaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby\nfor lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside my eyes\npicked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.\n\n\"Mr. Carraway this is my friend Mr. Wolfsheim.\"\n\nA small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two\nfine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I\ndiscovered his tiny eyes in the half darkness.\n\n\"--so I took one look at him--\" said Mr. Wolfsheim, shaking my hand\nearnestly, \"--and what do you think I did?\"\n\n\"What?\" I inquired politely.\n\nBut evidently he was not addressing me for he dropped my hand and\ncovered Gatsby with his expressive nose.\n\n\"I handed the money to Katspaugh and I sid, 'All right, Katspaugh,\ndon't pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.' He shut it then and\nthere.\"\n\nGatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the\nrestaurant whereupon Mr. Wolfsheim swallowed a new sentence he was\nstarting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.\n\n\"Highballs?\" asked the head waiter.\n\n\"This is a nice restaurant here,\" said Mr. Wolfsheim looking at the\nPresbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. \"But I like across the street better!\"\n\n\"Yes, highballs,\" agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfsheim: \"It's too hot\nover there.\"\n\n\"Hot and small--yes,\" said Mr. Wolfsheim, \"but full of memories.\"\n\n\"What place is that?\" I asked.\n\n\"The old Metropole.\n\n\"The old Metropole,\" brooded Mr. Wolfsheim gloomily. \"Filled with faces\ndead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can't forget so\nlong as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It was six of us\nat the table and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening. When it was\nalmost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says\nsomebody wants to speak to him outside. 'All right,' says Rosy and begins\nto get up and I pulled him down in his chair.\n\n\" 'Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don't you,\nso help me, move outside this room.'\n\n\"It was four o'clock in the morning then, and if we'd of raised the blinds\nwe'd of seen daylight.\"\n\n\"Did he go?\" I asked innocently.\n\n\"Sure he went,\"--Mr. Wolfsheim's nose flashed at me indignantly--\"He\nturned around in the door and says, 'Don't let that waiter take away\nmy coffee!' Then he went out on the sidewalk and they shot him\nthree times in his full belly and drove away.\"\n\n\"Four of them were electrocuted,\" I said, remembering.\n\n\"Five with Becker.\" His nostrils turned to me in an interested way.\n\"I understand you're looking for a business gonnegtion.\"\n\nThe juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered\nfor me:\n\n\"Oh, no,\" he exclaimed, \"this isn't the man!\"\n\n\"No?\" Mr. Wolfsheim seemed disappointed.\n\n\"This is just a friend. I told you we'd talk about that some other\ntime.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. Wolfsheim, \"I had a wrong man.\"\n\nA succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfsheim, forgetting the more\nsentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with\nferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the\nroom--he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly\nbehind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have taken one\nshort glance beneath our own table.\n\n\"Look here, old sport,\" said Gatsby, leaning toward me, \"I'm afraid I\nmade you a little angry this morning in the car.\"\n\nThere was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.\n\n\"I don't like mysteries,\" I answered. \"And I don't understand why you\nwon't come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got to\ncome through Miss Baker?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing underhand,\" he assured me. \"Miss Baker's a great\nsportswoman, you know, and she'd never do anything that wasn't all right.\"\n\nSuddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up and hurried from the room\nleaving me with Mr. Wolfsheim at the table.\n\n\"He has to telephone,\" said Mr. Wolfsheim, following him with his eyes.\n\"Fine fellow, isn't he? Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"He's an Oggsford man.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?\"\n\n\"I've heard of it.\"\n\n\"It's one of the most famous colleges in the world.\"\n\n\"Have you known Gatsby for a long time?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Several years,\" he answered in a gratified way. \"I made the pleasure of\nhis acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a man of\nfine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to myself: 'There's\nthe kind of man you'd like to take home and introduce to your mother and\nsister.' \" He paused. \"I see you're looking at my cuff buttons.\"\n\nI hadn't been looking at them, but I did now.  They were composed of\noddly familiar pieces of ivory.\n\n\"Finest specimens of human molars,\" he informed me.\n\n\"Well!\" I inspected them. \"That's a very interesting idea.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. \"Yeah, Gatsby's very\ncareful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend's wife.\"\n\nWhen the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat\ndown Mr. Wolfsheim drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet.\n\n\"I have enjoyed my lunch,\" he said, \"and I'm going to run off from you\ntwo young men before I outstay my welcome.\"\n\n\"Don't hurry, Meyer,\" said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfsheim\nraised his hand in a sort of benediction.\n\n\"You're very polite but I belong to another generation,\" he announced\nsolemnly. \"You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and\nyour----\" He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his\nhand--\"As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won't impose myself\non you any longer.\"\n\nAs he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling.\nI wondered if I had said anything to offend him.\n\n\"He becomes very sentimental sometimes,\" explained Gatsby. \"This is one of\nhis sentimental days. He's quite a character around New York--a denizen of\nBroadway.\"\n\n\"Who is he anyhow--an actor?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"A dentist?\"\n\n\"Meyer Wolfsheim? No, he's a gambler.\" Gatsby hesitated, then added\ncoolly: \"He's the man who fixed the World's Series back in 1919.\"\n\n\"Fixed the World's Series?\" I repeated.\n\nThe idea staggered me. I remembered of course that the World's Series\nhad been fixed in 1919 but if I had thought of it at all I would have\nthought of it as a thing that merely HAPPENED, the end of some\ninevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could start to\nplay with the faith of fifty million people--with the single-mindedness\nof a burglar blowing a safe.\n\n\"How did he happen to do that?\" I asked after a minute.\n\n\"He just saw the opportunity.\"\n\n\"Why isn't he in jail?\"\n\n\"They can't get him, old sport. He's a smart man.\"\n\nI insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I caught\nsight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.\n\n\"Come along with me for a minute,\" I said. \"I've got to say hello\nto someone.\"\n\nWhen he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our\ndirection.\n\n\"Where've you been?\" he demanded eagerly. \"Daisy's furious because you\nhaven't called up.\"\n\n\"This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.\"\n\nThey shook hands briefly and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment\ncame over Gatsby's face.\n\n\"How've you been, anyhow?\" demanded Tom of me. \"How'd you happen to come\nup this far to eat?\"\n\n\"I've been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.\"\n\nI turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.\n\n\nOne October day in nineteen-seventeen----\n(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight\nchair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)\n--I was walking along from one place to another half on the sidewalks and\nhalf on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from\nEngland with rubber nobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground.\nI had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind and\nwhenever this happened the red, white and blue banners in front of all\nthe houses stretched out stiff and said TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT in a disapproving\nway.\n\nThe largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to\nDaisy Fay's house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and\nby far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She\ndressed in white, and had a little white roadster and all day long\nthe telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp\nTaylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night, \"anyways,\nfor an hour!\"\n\nWhen I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside\nthe curb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen\nbefore. They were so engrossed in each other that she didn't see me until\nI was five feet away.\n\n\"Hello Jordan,\" she called unexpectedly. \"Please come here.\"\n\nI was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older\ngirls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and\nmake bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn't come\nthat day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way\nthat every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it\nseemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since. His name\nwas Jay Gatsby and I didn't lay eyes on him again for over four\nyears--even after I'd met him on Long Island I didn't realize it was the\nsame man.\n\nThat was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux myself,\nand I began to play in tournaments, so I didn't see Daisy very often.\nShe went with a slightly older crowd--when she went with anyone at all.\nWild rumors were circulating about her--how her mother had found her\npacking her bag one winter night to go to New York and say goodbye to a\nsoldier who was going overseas. She was effectually prevented, but she\nwasn't on speaking terms with her family for several weeks. After\nthat she didn't play around with the soldiers any more but only\nwith a few flat-footed, short-sighted young men in town who couldn't\nget into the army at all.\n\nBy the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a debut\nafter the Armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a\nman from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago with\nmore pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He came\ndown with a hundred people in four private cars and hired a whole\nfloor of the Seelbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave her\na string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\n\nI was bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the bridal\ndinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in\nher flowered dress--and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle of\nsauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.\n\n\" 'Gratulate me,\" she muttered. \"Never had a drink before but oh, how I do\nenjoy it.\"\n\n\"What's the matter, Daisy?\"\n\nI was scared, I can tell you; I'd never seen a girl like that before.\n\n\"Here, dearis.\" She groped around in a waste-basket she had with her\non the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. \"Take 'em downstairs and\ngive 'em back to whoever they belong to. Tell 'em all Daisy's change' her\nmine. Say 'Daisy's change' her mine!'.\"\n\nShe began to cry--she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her\nmother's maid and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath. She\nwouldn't let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her and\nsqueezed it up into a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the\nsoap dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.\n\nBut she didn't say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and put\nice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress and half an\nhour later when we walked out of the room the pearls were around her\nneck and the incident was over. Next day at five o'clock she married Tom\nBuchanan without so much as a shiver and started off on a three months'\ntrip to the South Seas.\n\nI saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back and I thought I'd\nnever seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he left the room for a\nminute she'd look around uneasily and say \"Where's Tom gone?\" and\nwear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the\ndoor. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour\nrubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable\ndelight. It was touching to see them together--it made you laugh in a\nhushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I left Santa\nBarbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night and ripped\na front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got into the\npapers too because her arm was broken--she was one of the chambermaids\nin the Santa Barbara Hotel.\n\nThe next April Daisy had her little girl and they went to France for a\nyear. I saw them one spring in Cannes and later in Deauville and then\nthey came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in Chicago,\nas you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich\nand wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation.\nPerhaps because she doesn't drink. It's a great advantage not to drink\namong hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and, moreover,\nyou can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else\nis so blind that they don't see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in\nfor amour at all--and yet there's something in that voice of hers. . . .\n\nWell, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time\nin years. It was when I asked you--do you remember?--if you knew Gatsby\nin West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me\nup, and said \"What Gatsby?\" and when I described him--I was half\nasleep--she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used\nto know. It wasn't until then that I connected this Gatsby with the\nofficer in her white car.\n\n\nWhen Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza\nfor half an hour and were driving in a Victoria through Central Park.\nThe sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in\nthe West Fifties and the clear voices of girls, already gathered like\ncrickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:\n\n\n    \"I'm the Sheik of Araby,\n    Your love belongs to me.\n    At night when you're asleep,\n    Into your tent I'll creep----\"\n\n\n\"It was a strange coincidence,\" I said.\n\n\"But it wasn't a coincidence at all.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.\"\n\nThen it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired\non that June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the\nwomb of his purposeless splendor.\n\n\"He wants to know--\" continued Jordan \"--if you'll invite Daisy to your\nhouse some afternoon and then let him come over.\"\n\nThe modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and bought a\nmansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths so that he could\n\"come over\" some afternoon to a stranger's garden.\n\n\"Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?\"\n\n\"He's afraid. He's waited so long. He thought you might be offended.\nYou see he's a regular tough underneath it all.\"\n\nSomething worried me.\n\n\"Why didn't he ask you to arrange a meeting?\"\n\n\"He wants her to see his house,\" she explained. \"And your house is right\nnext door.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties,\nsome night,\" went on Jordan, \"but she never did. Then he began asking\npeople casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found.\nIt was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have\nheard the elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately\nsuggested a luncheon in New York--and I thought he'd go mad:\n\n\" 'I don't want to do anything out of the way!' he kept saying. 'I want to\nsee her right next door.'\n\n\"When I said you were a particular friend of Tom's he started to abandon\nthe whole idea. He doesn't know very much about Tom, though he says he's\nread a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse\nof Daisy's name.\"\n\nIt was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm\naround Jordan's golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to\ndinner. Suddenly I wasn't thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more but of\nthis clean, hard, limited person who dealt in universal skepticism and\nwho leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm. A phrase began\nto beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: \"There are only the\npursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.\"\n\n\"And Daisy ought to have something in her life,\" murmured Jordan to me.\n\n\"Does she want to see Gatsby?\"\n\n\"She's not to know about it. Gatsby doesn't want her to know. You're\njust supposed to invite her to tea.\"\n\nWe passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the facade of Fifty-ninth\nStreet, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park.\nUnlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan I had no girl whose disembodied face\nfloated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so I drew up the\ngirl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth smiled and so\nI drew her up again, closer, this time to my face.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n\n\nWhen I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that\nmy house was on fire. Two o'clock and the whole corner of the peninsula\nwas blazing with light which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin\nelongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a corner I saw that it\nwas Gatsby's house, lit from tower to cellar.\n\nAt first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved\nitself into \"hide-and-go-seek\" or \"sardines-in-the-box\" with all the\nhouse thrown open to the game. But there wasn't a sound. Only wind in\nthe trees which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again\nas if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned away I\nsaw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.\n\n\"Your place looks like the world's fair,\" I said.\n\n\"Does it?\" He turned his eyes toward it absently. \"I have been glancing\ninto some of the rooms. Let's go to Coney Island, old sport. In my car.\"\n\n\"It's too late.\"\n\n\"Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven't made use\nof it all summer.\"\n\n\"I've got to go to bed.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nHe waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.\n\n\"I talked with Miss Baker,\" I said after a moment. \"I'm going to call up\nDaisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" he said carelessly. \"I don't want to put you to\nany trouble.\"\n\n\"What day would suit you?\"\n\n\"What day would suit YOU?\" he corrected me quickly. \"I don't want to put\nyou to any trouble, you see.\"\n\n\"How about the day after tomorrow?\" He considered for a moment. Then,\nwith reluctance:\n\n\"I want to get the grass cut,\" he said.\n\nWe both looked at the grass--there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn\nended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I suspected that\nhe meant my grass.\n\n\"There's another little thing,\" he said uncertainly, and hesitated.\n\n\"Would you rather put it off for a few days?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, it isn't about that. At least----\" He fumbled with a series of\nbeginnings. \"Why, I thought--why, look here, old sport, you don't make\nmuch money, do you?\"\n\n\"Not very much.\"\n\nThis seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.\n\n\"I thought you didn't, if you'll pardon my--you see, I carry on a\nlittle business on the side, a sort of sideline, you understand. And I\nthought that if you don't make very much--You're selling bonds, aren't\nyou, old sport?\"\n\n\"Trying to.\"\n\n\"Well, this would interest you. It wouldn't take up much of your\ntime and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be\na rather confidential sort of thing.\"\n\nI realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might\nhave been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer was\nobviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no choice\nexcept to cut him off there.\n\n\"I've got my hands full,\" I said. \"I'm much obliged but I couldn't take\non any more work.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't have to do any business with Wolfsheim.\" Evidently he\nthought that I was shying away from the \"gonnegtion\" mentioned at lunch,\nbut I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer, hoping I'd\nbegin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went\nunwillingly home.\n\nThe evening had made me light-headed and happy; I think I walked into a\ndeep sleep as I entered my front door. So I didn't know whether or not\nGatsby went to Coney Island or for how many hours he \"glanced into\nrooms\" while his house blazed gaudily on. I called up Daisy from the\noffice next morning and invited her to come to tea.\n\n\"Don't bring Tom,\" I warned her.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Don't bring Tom.\"\n\n\"Who is 'Tom'?\" she asked innocently.\n\nThe day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven o'clock a man in a\nraincoat dragging a lawn-mower tapped at my front door and said that\nMr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I\nhad forgotten to tell my Finn to come back so I drove into West Egg\nVillage to search for her among soggy white-washed alleys and to buy\nsome cups and lemons and flowers.\n\nThe flowers were unnecessary, for at two o'clock a greenhouse arrived\nfrom Gatsby's, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour\nlater the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel\nsuit, silver shirt and gold-colored tie hurried in. He was pale and\nthere were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.\n\n\"Is everything all right?\" he asked immediately.\n\n\"The grass looks fine, if that's what you mean.\"\n\n\"What grass?\" he inquired blankly. \"Oh, the grass in the yard.\" He looked\nout the window at it, but judging from his expression I don't believe\nhe saw a thing.\n\n\"Looks very good,\" he remarked vaguely. \"One of the papers said they\nthought the rain would stop about four. I think it was 'The Journal.' Have\nyou got everything you need in the shape of--of tea?\"\n\nI took him into the pantry where he looked a little reproachfully at the\nFinn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen\nshop.\n\n\"Will they do?\" I asked.\n\n\"Of course, of course! They're fine!\" and he added hollowly, \". . .old\nsport.\"\n\nThe rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist through which\noccasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes\nthrough a copy of Clay's \"Economics,\" starting at the Finnish tread that\nshook the kitchen floor and peering toward the bleared windows from time\nto time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking\nplace outside. Finally he got up and informed me in an uncertain voice\nthat he was going home.\n\n\"Why's that?\"\n\n\"Nobody's coming to tea. It's too late!\" He looked at his watch as if\nthere was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. \"I can't wait\nall day.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly; it's just two minutes to four.\"\n\nHe sat down, miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously there\nwas the sound of a motor turning into my lane. We both jumped up and,\na little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.\n\nUnder the dripping bare lilac trees a large open car was coming up the\ndrive. It stopped. Daisy's face, tipped sideways beneath a\nthree-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic\nsmile.\n\n\"Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?\"\n\nThe exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had\nto follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone\nbefore any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of\nblue paint across her cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as\nI took it to help her from the car.\n\n\"Are you in love with me,\" she said low in my ear. \"Or why did I have\nto come alone?\"\n\n\"That's the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far\naway and spend an hour.\"\n\n\"Come back in an hour, Ferdie.\" Then in a grave murmur, \"His name is\nFerdie.\"\n\n\"Does the gasoline affect his nose?\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" she said innocently. \"Why?\"\n\nWe went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living room was deserted.\n\n\"Well, that's funny!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"What's funny?\"\n\nShe turned her head as there was a light, dignified knocking at the front\ndoor. I went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands\nplunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of\nwater glaring tragically into my eyes.\n\nWith his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the\nhall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire and disappeared into the\nliving room. It wasn't a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of my own\nheart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.\n\nFor half a minute there wasn't a sound. Then from the living room I\nheard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh followed by Daisy's\nvoice on a clear artificial note.\n\n\"I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.\"\n\nA pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall so I went\ninto the room.\n\nGatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the\nmantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom.\nHis head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a\ndefunct mantelpiece clock and from this position his distraught eyes\nstared down at Daisy who was sitting frightened but graceful on the\nedge of a stiff chair.\n\n\"We've met before,\" muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily at\nme and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily\nthe clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his\nhead, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers and set\nit back in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the\nsofa and his chin in his hand.\n\n\"I'm sorry about the clock,\" he said.\n\nMy own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldn't muster up\na single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.\n\n\"It's an old clock,\" I told them idiotically.\n\nI think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on\nthe floor.\n\n\"We haven't met for many years,\" said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact\nas it could ever be.\n\n\"Five years next November.\"\n\nThe automatic quality of Gatsby's answer set us all back at least another\nminute. I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that\nthey help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in\non a tray.\n\nAmid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency\nestablished itself. Gatsby got himself into a shadow and while Daisy\nand I talked looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with\ntense unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn't an end in itself I\nmade an excuse at the first possible moment and got to my feet.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.\n\n\"I'll be back.\"\n\n\"I've got to speak to you about something before you go.\"\n\nHe followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door and whispered:\n\"Oh, God!\" in a miserable way.\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"This is a terrible mistake,\" he said, shaking his head from side to\nside, \"a terrible, terrible mistake.\"\n\n\"You're just embarrassed, that's all,\" and luckily I added: \"Daisy's\nembarrassed too.\"\n\n\"She's embarrassed?\" he repeated incredulously.\n\n\"Just as much as you are.\"\n\n\"Don't talk so loud.\"\n\n\"You're acting like a little boy,\" I broke out impatiently. \"Not only\nthat but you're rude. Daisy's sitting in there all alone.\"\n\n\nHe raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable\nreproach and opening the door cautiously went back into the other room.\n\nI walked out the back way--just as Gatsby had when he had made his\nnervous circuit of the house half an hour before--and ran for a huge\nblack knotted tree whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain.\nOnce more it was pouring and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by\nGatsby's gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric\nmarshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree except\nGatsby's enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church\nsteeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the \"period\"\ncraze, a decade before, and there was a story that he'd agreed to pay\nfive years' taxes on all the neighboring cottages if the owners would\nhave their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the\nheart out of his plan to Found a Family--he went into an immediate\ndecline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the\ndoor. Americans, while occasionally willing to be serfs, have always\nbeen obstinate about being peasantry.\n\nAfter half an hour the sun shone again and the grocer's automobile\nrounded Gatsby's drive with the raw material for his servants' dinner--I\nfelt sure he wouldn't eat a spoonful. A maid began opening the upper\nwindows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from a\nlarge central bay, spat meditatively into the garden. It was time I\nwent back. While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of\ntheir voices, rising and swelling a little, now and then, with gusts of\nemotion. But in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen within\nthe house too.\n\nI went in--after making every possible noise in the kitchen short of\npushing over the stove--but I don't believe they heard a sound. They\nwere sitting at either end of the couch looking at each other as if\nsome question had been asked or was in the air, and every vestige of\nembarrassment was gone. Daisy's face was smeared with tears and when I\ncame in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before\na mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding.\nHe literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new\nwell-being radiated from him and filled the little room.\n\n\"Oh, hello, old sport,\" he said, as if he hadn't seen me for years. I\nthought for a moment he was going to shake hands.\n\n\"It's stopped raining.\"\n\n\"Has it?\" When he realized what I was talking about, that there were\ntwinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man,\nlike an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to\nDaisy. \"What do you think of that? It's stopped raining.\"\n\n\"I'm glad, Jay.\" Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only\nof her unexpected joy.\n\n\"I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,\" he said, \"I'd like to\nshow her around.\"\n\n\"You're sure you want me to come?\"\n\n\"Absolutely, old sport.\"\n\nDaisy went upstairs to wash her face--too late I thought with humiliation\nof my towels--while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.\n\n\"My house looks well, doesn't it?\" he demanded. \"See how the whole\nfront of it catches the light.\"\n\nI agreed that it was splendid.\n\n\"Yes.\" His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. \"It took\nme just three years to earn the money that bought it.\"\n\n\"I thought you inherited your money.\"\n\n\"I did, old sport,\" he said automatically, \"but I lost most of it in\nthe big panic--the panic of the war.\"\n\nI think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what\nbusiness he was in he answered \"That's my affair,\" before he realized\nthat it wasn't the appropriate reply.\n\n\"Oh, I've been in several things,\" he corrected himself. \"I was in the\ndrug business and then I was in the oil business. But I'm not in either\none now.\" He looked at me with more attention. \"Do you mean you've been\nthinking over what I proposed the other night?\"\n\nBefore I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass\nbuttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.\n\n\"That huge place THERE?\" she cried pointing.\n\n\"Do you like it?\"\n\n\"I love it, but I don't see how you live there all alone.\"\n\n\"I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People who\ndo interesting things. Celebrated people.\"\n\nInstead of taking the short cut along the Sound we went down the road and\nentered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this\naspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the\ngardens, the sparkling odor of jonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn\nand plum blossoms and the pale gold odor of kiss-me-at-the-gate.\nIt was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright\ndresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the\ntrees.\n\nAnd inside as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music rooms and\nRestoration salons I felt that there were guests concealed behind\nevery couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we\nhad passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of \"the Merton College\nLibrary\" I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into\nghostly laughter.\n\nWe went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender\nsilk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing rooms and poolrooms,\nand bathrooms with sunken baths--intruding into one chamber where a\ndishevelled man in pajamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It\nwas Mr. Klipspringer, the \"boarder.\" I had seen him wandering hungrily\nabout the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby's own apartment,\na bedroom and a bath and an Adam study, where we sat down and drank a\nglass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall.\n\nHe hadn't once ceased looking at Daisy and I think he revalued\neverything in his house according to the measure of response it drew\nfrom her well-loved eyes. Sometimes, too, he stared around at his\npossessions in a dazed way as though in her actual and astounding\npresence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a\nflight of stairs.\n\nHis bedroom was the simplest room of all--except where the dresser was\ngarnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush\nwith delight and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and\nshaded his eyes and began to laugh.\n\n\"It's the funniest thing, old sport,\" he said hilariously. \"I can't--when\nI try to----\"\n\nHe had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third.\nAfter his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with\nwonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed it\nright through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak, at an\ninconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction, he was running\ndown like an overwound clock.\n\nRecovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent\ncabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and\nhis shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.\n\n\"I've got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection\nof things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.\"\n\nHe took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one\nbefore us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel\nwhich lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in\nmany-colored disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft\nrich heap mounted higher--shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in\ncoral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange with monograms of\nIndian blue. Suddenly with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into\nthe shirts and began to cry stormily.\n\n\"They're such beautiful shirts,\" she sobbed, her voice muffled in the\nthick folds. \"It makes me sad because I've never seen such--such beautiful\nshirts before.\"\n\n\nAfter the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and the\nhydroplane and the midsummer flowers--but outside Gatsby's window it\nbegan to rain again so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated\nsurface of the Sound.\n\n\"If it wasn't for the mist we could see your home across the bay,\" said\nGatsby. \"You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of\nyour dock.\"\n\nDaisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed\nin what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the\ncolossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared\nto the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed\nvery near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star\nto the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of\nenchanted objects had diminished by one.\n\nI began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in\nthe half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting\ncostume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.\n\n\"Who's this?\"\n\n\"That? That's Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.\"\n\nThe name sounded faintly familiar.\n\n\"He's dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.\"\n\nThere was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the\nbureau--Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly--taken apparently\nwhen he was about eighteen.\n\n\"I adore it!\" exclaimed Daisy. \"The pompadour! You never told me you had\na pompadour--or a yacht.\"\n\n\"Look at this,\" said Gatsby quickly. \"Here's a lot of clippings--about\nyou.\"\n\nThey stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the rubies\nwhen the phone rang and Gatsby took up the receiver.\n\n\"Yes. . . . Well, I can't talk now. . . . I can't talk now, old\nsport. . . . I said a SMALL town. . . . He must know what a small town\nis. . . . Well, he's no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small\ntown. . . .\"\n\nHe rang off.\n\n\"Come here QUICK!\" cried Daisy at the window.\n\nThe rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west,\nand there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.\n\n\"Look at that,\" she whispered, and then after a moment: \"I'd like to\njust get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you\naround.\"\n\nI tried to go then, but they wouldn't hear of it; perhaps my presence\nmade them feel more satisfactorily alone.\n\n\"I know what we'll do,\" said Gatsby, \"we'll have Klipspringer play the\npiano.\"\n\nHe went out of the room calling \"Ewing!\" and returned in a few\nminutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man with\nshell-rimmed glasses and scanty blonde hair. He was now decently clothed\nin a \"sport shirt\" open at the neck, sneakers and duck trousers of a\nnebulous hue.\n\n\"Did we interrupt your exercises?\" inquired Daisy politely.\n\n\"I was asleep,\" cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment.\n\"That is, I'd BEEN asleep. Then I got up. . . .\"\n\n\"Klipspringer plays the piano,\" said Gatsby, cutting him off. \"Don't you,\nEwing, old sport?\"\n\n\"I don't play well. I don't--I hardly play at all. I'm all out of\nprac----\"\n\n\"We'll go downstairs,\" interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The\ngrey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.\n\nIn the music room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano. He\nlit Daisy's cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on\na couch far across the room where there was no light save what the\ngleaming floor bounced in from the hall.\n\nWhen Klipspringer had played \"The Love Nest\" he turned around on the\nbench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.\n\n\"I'm all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn't play. I'm all\nout of prac----\"\n\n\"Don't talk so much, old sport,\" commanded Gatsby. \"Play!\"\n\n\n    IN THE MORNING,\n    IN THE EVENING,\n       AIN'T WE GOT FUN----\n\nOutside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the\nSound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains,\nmen-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York. It was\nthe hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating on\nthe air.\n\n\n    ONE THING'S SURE AND NOTHING'S SURER\n    THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET--CHILDREN.\n       IN THE MEANTIME,\n       IN BETWEEN TIME----\n\n\nAs I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of bewilderment\nhad come back into Gatsby's face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to\nhim as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost five\nyears! There must have been moments even that afternoon when\nDaisy tumbled short of his dreams--not through her own fault but\nbecause of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond\nher, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative\npassion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright\nfeather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can\nchallenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.\n\nAs I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took\nhold of hers and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward\nher with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most with its\nfluctuating, feverish warmth because it couldn't be over-dreamed--that\nvoice was a deathless song.\n\nThey had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand;\nGatsby didn't know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they\nlooked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I went out\nof the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there\ntogether.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n\n\nAbout this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one\nmorning at Gatsby's door and asked him if he had anything to say.\n\n\"Anything to say about what?\" inquired Gatsby politely.\n\n\"Why,--any statement to give out.\"\n\nIt transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard\nGatsby's name around his office in a connection which he either\nwouldn't reveal or didn't fully understand. This was his day off\nand with laudable initiative he had hurried out \"to see.\"\n\nIt was a random shot, and yet the reporter's instinct was right. Gatsby's\nnotoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his\nhospitality and so become authorities on his past, had increased\nall summer until he fell just short of being news. Contemporary\nlegends such as the \"underground pipe-line to Canada\" attached\nthemselves to him, and there was one persistent story that he\ndidn't live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house\nand was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore. Just why\nthese inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North\nDakota, isn't easy to say.\n\nJames Gatz--that was really, or at least legally, his name. He had\nchanged it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that\nwitnessed the beginning of his career--when he saw Dan Cody's yacht drop\nanchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior. It was James Gatz\nwho had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green\njersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby who\nborrowed a row-boat, pulled out to the TUOLOMEE and informed Cody that\na wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour.\n\nI suppose he'd had the name ready for a long time, even then. His\nparents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people--his imagination had\nnever really accepted them as his parents at all. The truth was that\nJay Gatsby, of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic\nconception of himself. He was a son of God--a phrase which, if it means\nanything, means just that--and he must be about His Father's Business,\nthe service of a vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty. So he invented\njust the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be\nlikely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.\n\nFor over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of\nLake Superior as a clam digger and a salmon fisher or in any other\ncapacity that brought him food and bed. His brown, hardening body lived\nnaturally through the half fierce, half lazy work of the bracing days.\nHe knew women early and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous\nof them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of the others\nbecause they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming\nself-absorption he took for granted.\n\nBut his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque\nand fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe\nof ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the\nclock ticked on the wash-stand and the moon soaked with wet\nlight his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the\npattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid\nscene with an oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an\noutlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the\nunreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded\nsecurely on a fairy's wing.\n\nAn instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to\nthe small Lutheran college of St. Olaf in southern Minnesota. He stayed\nthere two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of\nhis destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor's work with\nwhich he was to pay his way through. Then he drifted back to Lake\nSuperior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day\nthat Dan Cody's yacht dropped anchor in the shallows along shore.\n\nCody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields,\nof the Yukon, of every rush for metal since Seventy-five. The\ntransactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire\nfound him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and,\nsuspecting this an infinite number of women tried to separate him from\nhis money. The none too savory ramifications by which Ella Kaye, the\nnewspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him\nto sea in a yacht, were common knowledge to the turgid journalism\nof 1902. He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five\nyears when he turned up as James Gatz's destiny at Little Girl Bay.\n\nTo the young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed\ndeck, the yacht represented all the beauty and glamor in the world. I\nsuppose he smiled at Cody--he had probably discovered that people liked\nhim when he smiled. At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of\nthem elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick, and\nextravagantly ambitious. A few days later he took him to Duluth and\nbought him a blue coat, six pair of white duck trousers and a yachting\ncap. And when the TUOLOMEE left for the West Indies and the Barbary\nCoast Gatsby left too.\n\nHe was employed in a vague personal capacity--while he remained with\nCody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor,\nfor Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be\nabout and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more\ntrust in Gatsby. The arrangement lasted five years during which the\nboat went three times around the continent. It might have lasted\nindefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night\nin Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died.\n\nI remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby's bedroom, a grey, florid\nman with a hard empty face--the pioneer debauchee who during one phase\nof American life brought back to the eastern seaboard the savage\nviolence of the frontier brothel and saloon. It was indirectly due to\nCody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gay parties\nwomen used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the\nhabit of letting liquor alone.\n\nAnd it was from Cody that he inherited money--a legacy of twenty-five\nthousand dollars. He didn't get it. He never understood the legal\ndevice that was used against him but what remained of the millions\nwent intact to Ella Kaye. He was left with his singularly appropriate\neducation; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the\nsubstantiality of a man.\n\n\nHe told me all this very much later, but I've put it down here with the\nidea of exploding those first wild rumors about his antecedents, which\nweren't even faintly true. Moreover he told it to me at a time of\nconfusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and\nnothing about him. So I take advantage of this short halt, while\nGatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of\nmisconceptions away.\n\nIt was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. For\nseveral weeks I didn't see him or hear his voice on the phone--mostly\nI was in New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to\ningratiate myself with her senile aunt--but finally I went over to\nhis house one Sunday afternoon. I hadn't been there two minutes when\nsomebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink. I was startled,\nnaturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadn't happened\nbefore.\n\nThey were a party of three on horseback--Tom and a man named Sloane and\na pretty woman in a brown riding habit who had been there previously.\n\n\"I'm delighted to see you,\" said Gatsby standing on his porch.\n\"I'm delighted that you dropped in.\"\n\nAs though they cared!\n\n\"Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.\" He walked around the room\nquickly, ringing bells. \"I'll have something to drink for you in just\na minute.\"\n\nHe was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But he would be\nuneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in a vague\nway that that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted nothing. A\nlemonade? No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at all,\nthanks. . . . I'm sorry----\n\n\"Did you have a nice ride?\"\n\n\"Very good roads around here.\"\n\n\"I suppose the automobiles----\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nMoved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom who had accepted\nthe introduction as a stranger.\n\n\"I believe we've met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Tom, gruffly polite but obviously not remembering.\n\"So we did. I remember very well.\"\n\n\"About two weeks ago.\"\n\n\"That's right. You were with Nick here.\"\n\n\"I know your wife,\" continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.\n\n\"That so?\"\n\nTom turned to me.\n\n\"You live near here, Nick?\"\n\n\"Next door.\"\n\n\"That so?\"\n\nMr. Sloane didn't enter into the conversation but lounged back haughtily\nin his chair; the woman said nothing either--until unexpectedly, after\ntwo highballs, she became cordial.\n\n\"We'll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,\" she suggested.\n\"What do you say?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I'd be delighted to have you.\"\n\n\"Be ver' nice,\" said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. \"Well--think ought to\nbe starting home.\"\n\n\"Please don't hurry,\" Gatsby urged them. He had control of himself now\nand he wanted to see more of Tom. \"Why don't you--why don't you stay for\nsupper? I wouldn't be surprised if some other people dropped in from\nNew York.\"\n\n\"You come to supper with ME,\" said the lady enthusiastically.\n\"Both of you.\"\n\nThis included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.\n\n\"Come along,\" he said--but to her only.\n\n\"I mean it,\" she insisted. \"I'd love to have you. Lots of room.\"\n\nGatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn't see\nthat Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn't.\n\n\"I'm afraid I won't be able to,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you come,\" she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.\n\nMr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.\n\n\"We won't be late if we start now,\" she insisted aloud.\n\n\"I haven't got a horse,\" said Gatsby. \"I used to ride in the army but\nI've never bought a horse. I'll have to follow you in my car. Excuse me\nfor just a minute.\"\n\nThe rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began\nan impassioned conversation aside.\n\n\"My God, I believe the man's coming,\" said Tom. \"Doesn't he know she\ndoesn't want him?\"\n\n\"She says she does want him.\"\n\n\"She has a big dinner party and he won't know a soul there.\" He frowned.\n\"I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be\nold-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to\nsuit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.\"\n\nSuddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted\ntheir horses.\n\n\"Come on,\" said Mr. Sloane to Tom, \"we're late. We've got to go.\" And then\nto me: \"Tell him we couldn't wait, will you?\"\n\nTom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod and\nthey trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August\nfoliage just as Gatsby with hat and light overcoat in hand came out\nthe front door.\n\nTom was evidently perturbed at Daisy's running around alone, for on the\nfollowing Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby's party. Perhaps\nhis presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness--it\nstands out in my memory from Gatsby's other parties that summer. There\nwere the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same\nprofusion of champagne, the same many-colored, many-keyed commotion,\nbut I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that\nhadn't been there before. Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it,\ngrown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own\nstandards and its own great figures, second to nothing because it had\nno consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at it again,\nthrough Daisy's eyes. It is invariably saddening to look through new\neyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of\nadjustment.\n\nThey arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among the sparkling\nhundreds Daisy's voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.\n\n\"These things excite me SO,\" she whispered. \"If you want to kiss me\nany time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I'll be glad\nto arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card.\nI'm giving out green----\"\n\n\"Look around,\" suggested Gatsby.\n\n\"I'm looking around. I'm having a marvelous----\"\n\n\"You must see the faces of many people you've heard about.\"\n\nTom's arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.\n\n\"We don't go around very much,\" he said. \"In fact I was just thinking\nI don't know a soul here.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you know that lady.\" Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely human\norchid of a woman who sat in state under a white plum tree. Tom and Daisy\nstared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the\nrecognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.\n\n\"She's lovely,\" said Daisy.\n\n\"The man bending over her is her director.\"\n\nHe took them ceremoniously from group to group:\n\n\"Mrs. Buchanan . . . and Mr. Buchanan----\" After an instant's hesitation\nhe added: \"the polo player.\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" objected Tom quickly, \"Not me.\"\n\nBut evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained \"the polo\nplayer\" for the rest of the evening.\n\n\"I've never met so many celebrities!\" Daisy exclaimed. \"I liked that\nman--what was his name?--with the sort of blue nose.\"\n\nGatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.\n\n\"Well, I liked him anyhow.\"\n\n\"I'd a little rather not be the polo player,\" said Tom pleasantly, \"I'd\nrather look at all these famous people in--in oblivion.\"\n\nDaisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful,\nconservative fox-trot--I had never seen him dance before. Then they\nsauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour while\nat her request I remained watchfully in the garden: \"In case there's a\nfire or a flood,\" she explained, \"or any act of God.\"\n\nTom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together.\n\"Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?\" he said. \"A fellow's\ngetting off some funny stuff.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" answered Daisy genially, \"And if you want to take down any\naddresses here's my little gold pencil. . . .\" She looked around after\na moment and told me the girl was \"common but pretty,\" and I knew that\nexcept for the half hour she'd been alone with Gatsby she wasn't having\na good time.\n\nWe were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault--Gatsby had\nbeen called to the phone and I'd enjoyed these same people only two\nweeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now.\n\n\"How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?\"\n\nThe girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my\nshoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.\n\n\"Wha?\"\n\nA massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf\nwith her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker's defence:\n\n\"Oh, she's all right now. When she's had five or six cocktails she always\nstarts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it alone.\"\n\n\"I do leave it alone,\" affirmed the accused hollowly.\n\n\"We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: 'There's somebody\nthat needs your help, Doc.' \"\n\n\"She's much obliged, I'm sure,\" said another friend, without gratitude.\n\"But you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool.\"\n\n\"Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,\" mumbled Miss\nBaedeker. \"They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.\"\n\n\"Then you ought to leave it alone,\" countered Doctor Civet.\n\n\"Speak for yourself!\" cried Miss Baedeker violently. \"Your hand shakes.\nI wouldn't let you operate on me!\"\n\nIt was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with\nDaisy and watching the moving picture director and his Star. They were\nstill under the white plum tree and their faces were touching except\nfor a pale thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he\nhad been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this\nproximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate degree\nand kiss at her cheek.\n\n\"I like her,\" said Daisy, \"I think she's lovely.\"\n\nBut the rest offended her--and inarguably, because it wasn't a gesture but\nan emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented \"place\"\nthat Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village--appalled\nby its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too\nobtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short cut from nothing\nto nothing. She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed\nto understand.\n\nI sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car. It\nwas dark here in front: only the bright door sent ten square feet of\nlight volleying out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a shadow\nmoved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow,\nan indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an\ninvisible glass.\n\n\"Who is this Gatsby anyhow?\" demanded Tom suddenly. \"Some big bootlegger?\"\n\n\"Where'd you hear that?\" I inquired.\n\n\"I didn't hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are\njust big bootleggers, you know.\"\n\n\"Not Gatsby,\" I said shortly.\n\nHe was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under his\nfeet.\n\n\"Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie\ntogether.\"\n\nA breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy's fur collar.\n\n\"At least they're more interesting than the people we know,\" she said\nwith an effort.\n\n\"You didn't look so interested.\"\n\n\"Well, I was.\"\n\nTom laughed and turned to me.\n\n\"Did you notice Daisy's face when that girl asked her to put her under\na cold shower?\"\n\nDaisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper,\nbringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had\nbefore and would never have again. When the melody rose, her voice\nbroke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and\neach change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.\n\n\"Lots of people come who haven't been invited,\" she said suddenly.\n\"That girl hadn't been invited. They simply force their way in and he's\ntoo polite to object.\"\n\n\"I'd like to know who he is and what he does,\" insisted Tom. \"And I think\nI'll make a point of finding out.\"\n\n\"I can tell you right now,\" she answered. \"He owned some drug stores,\na lot of drug stores. He built them up himself.\"\n\nThe dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.\n\n\"Good night, Nick,\" said Daisy.\n\nHer glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps where\n\"Three o'Clock in the Morning,\" a neat, sad little waltz of that year,\nwas drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of\nGatsby's party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from\nher world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling\nher back inside? What would happen now in the dim incalculable hours?\nPerhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare\nand to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with\none fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would blot\nout those five years of unwavering devotion.\n\n\nI stayed late that night. Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free\nand I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run\nup, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights were\nextinguished in the guest rooms overhead. When he came down the steps at\nlast the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes\nwere bright and tired.\n\n\"She didn't like it,\" he said immediately.\n\n\"Of course she did.\"\n\n\"She didn't like it,\" he insisted. \"She didn't have a good time.\"\n\nHe was silent and I guessed at his unutterable depression.\n\n\"I feel far away from her,\" he said. \"It's hard to make her understand.\"\n\n\"You mean about the dance?\"\n\n\"The dance?\" He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of\nhis fingers. \"Old sport, the dance is unimportant.\"\n\nHe wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say:\n\"I never loved you.\" After she had obliterated three years with that\nsentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken.\nOne of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back to\nLouisville and be married from her house--just as if it were five\nyears ago.\n\n\"And she doesn't understand,\" he said. \"She used to be able to\nunderstand. We'd sit for hours----\"\n\nHe broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds\nand discarded favors and crushed flowers.\n\n\"I wouldn't ask too much of her,\" I ventured. \"You can't repeat the past.\"\n\n\"Can't repeat the past?\" he cried incredulously. \"Why of course you can!\"\n\nHe looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the\nshadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.\n\n\"I'm going to fix everything just the way it was before,\" he said,\nnodding determinedly. \"She'll see.\"\n\nHe talked a lot about the past and I gathered that he wanted to recover\nsomething, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy.\nHis life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could\nonce return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he\ncould find out what that thing was. . . .\n\n. . . One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down\nthe street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where\nthere were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight.\nThey stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night\nwith that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of\nthe year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the\ndarkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the\ncorner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalk really\nformed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees--he could\nclimb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the\npap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.\n\nHis heart beat faster and faster as Daisy's white face came up to his\nown. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his\nunutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp\nagain like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer\nto the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed\nher. At his lips' touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the\nincarnation was complete.\n\nThrough all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was\nreminded of something--an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that\nI had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to\ntake shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man's, as though\nthere was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But\nthey made no sound and what I had almost remembered was\nuncommunicable forever.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\n\n\nIt was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights\nin his house failed to go on one Saturday night--and, as obscurely as it\nhad begun, his career as Trimalchio was over.\n\nOnly gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned\nexpectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove\nsulkily away. Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out--an\nunfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously\nfrom the door.\n\n\"Is Mr. Gatsby sick?\"\n\n\"Nope.\" After a pause he added \"sir\" in a dilatory, grudging way.\n\n\"I hadn't seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr. Carraway\ncame over.\"\n\n\"Who?\" he demanded rudely.\n\n\"Carraway.\"\n\n\"Carraway. All right, I'll tell him.\" Abruptly he slammed the door.\n\nMy Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his\nhouse a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never\nwent into West Egg Village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered\nmoderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that the\nkitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village was\nthat the new people weren't servants at all.\n\nNext day Gatsby called me on the phone.\n\n\"Going away?\" I inquired.\n\n\"No, old sport.\"\n\n\"I hear you fired all your servants.\"\n\n\"I wanted somebody who wouldn't gossip. Daisy comes over quite often--in\nthe afternoons.\"\n\nSo the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the\ndisapproval in her eyes.\n\n\"They're some people Wolfsheim wanted to do something for. They're all\nbrothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nHe was calling up at Daisy's request--would I come to lunch at\nher house tomorrow? Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later\nDaisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was coming.\nSomething was up. And yet I couldn't believe that they would choose\nthis occasion for a scene--especially for the rather harrowing scene\nthat Gatsby had outlined in the garden.\n\nThe next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of\nthe summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the\nhot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush\nat noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion;\nthe woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white\nshirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers,\nlapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry. Her pocket-book\nslapped to the floor.\n\n\"Oh, my!\" she gasped.\n\nI picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it\nat arm's length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that\nI had no designs upon it--but every one near by, including the woman,\nsuspected me just the same.\n\n\"Hot!\" said the conductor to familiar faces. \"Some weather! Hot! Hot! Hot!\nIs it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it . . . ?\"\n\nMy commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand.\nThat any one should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed,\nwhose head made damp the pajama pocket over his heart!\n\n. . . Through the hall of the Buchanans' house blew a faint wind,\ncarrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we\nwaited at the door.\n\n\"The master's body!\" roared the butler into the mouthpiece. \"I'm sorry,\nmadame, but we can't furnish it--it's far too hot to touch this noon!\"\n\nWhat he really said was: \"Yes . . . yes . . . I'll see.\"\n\nHe set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to take\nour stiff straw hats.\n\n\"Madame expects you in the salon!\" he cried, needlessly indicating the\ndirection. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the\ncommon store of life.\n\nThe room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and\nJordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols, weighing down\ntheir own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.\n\n\"We can't move,\" they said together.\n\nJordan's fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in\nmine.\n\n\"And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?\" I inquired.\n\nSimultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall\ntelephone.\n\nGatsby stood in the center of the crimson carpet and gazed around with\nfascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting\nlaugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.\n\n\"The rumor is,\" whispered Jordan, \"that that's Tom's girl on the\ntelephone.\"\n\nWe were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance.\n\"Very well, then, I won't sell you the car at all. . . . I'm\nunder no obligations to you at all. . . . And as for your bothering me\nabout it at lunch time I won't stand that at all!\"\n\n\"Holding down the receiver,\" said Daisy cynically.\n\n\"No, he's not,\" I assured her. \"It's a bona fide deal. I happen to\nknow about it.\"\n\nTom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his\nthick body, and hurried into the room.\n\n\"Mr. Gatsby!\" He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed\ndislike. \"I'm glad to see you, sir. . . . Nick. . . .\"\n\n\"Make us a cold drink,\" cried Daisy.\n\nAs he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled\nhis face down kissing him on the mouth.\n\n\"You know I love you,\" she murmured.\n\n\"You forget there's a lady present,\" said Jordan.\n\nDaisy looked around doubtfully.\n\n\"You kiss Nick too.\"\n\n\"What a low, vulgar girl!\"\n\n\"I don't care!\" cried Daisy and began to clog on the brick fireplace.\nThen she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as\na freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.\n\n\"Bles-sed pre-cious,\" she crooned, holding out her arms. \"Come to your\nown mother that loves you.\"\n\nThe child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and rooted\nshyly into her mother's dress.\n\n\"The Bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy\nhair? Stand up now, and say How-de-do.\"\n\nGatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand.\nAfterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don't think he had\never really believed in its existence before.\n\n\"I got dressed before luncheon,\" said the child, turning eagerly to\nDaisy.\n\n\"That's because your mother wanted to show you off.\" Her face bent into\nthe single wrinkle of the small white neck. \"You dream, you. You absolute\nlittle dream.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" admitted the child calmly. \"Aunt Jordan's got on a white\ndress too.\"\n\n\"How do you like mother's friends?\" Daisy turned her around so that she\nfaced Gatsby. \"Do you think they're pretty?\"\n\n\"Where's Daddy?\"\n\n\"She doesn't look like her father,\" explained Daisy. \"She looks like me.\nShe's got my hair and shape of the face.\"\n\nDaisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held\nout her hand.\n\n\"Come, Pammy.\"\n\n\"Goodbye, sweetheart!\"\n\nWith a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her\nnurse's hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back,\npreceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.\n\nGatsby took up his drink.\n\n\"They certainly look cool,\" he said, with visible tension.\n\nWe drank in long greedy swallows.\n\n\"I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter every year,\" said Tom\ngenially. \"It seems that pretty soon the earth's going to fall into the\nsun--or wait a minute--it's just the opposite--the sun's getting colder\nevery year.\n\n\"Come outside,\" he suggested to Gatsby, \"I'd like you to have a look at\nthe place.\"\n\nI went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in the\nheat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea. Gatsby's eyes\nfollowed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay.\n\n\"I'm right across from you.\"\n\n\"So you are.\"\n\nOur eyes lifted over the rosebeds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse\nof the dog days along shore. Slowly the white wings of the boat moved\nagainst the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and\nthe abounding blessed isles.\n\n\"There's sport for you,\" said Tom, nodding. \"I'd like to be out there\nwith him for about an hour.\"\n\nWe had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened, too, against the heat,\nand drank down nervous gayety with the cold ale.\n\n\"What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon,\" cried Daisy, \"and the\nday after that, and the next thirty years?\"\n\n\"Don't be morbid,\" Jordan said. \"Life starts all over again when it gets\ncrisp in the fall.\"\n\n\"But it's so hot,\" insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, \"And\neverything's so confused. Let's all go to town!\"\n\nHer voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding its\nsenselessness into forms.\n\n\"I've heard of making a garage out of a stable,\" Tom was saying to\nGatsby, \"but I'm the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.\"\n\n\"Who wants to go to town?\" demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby's eyes\nfloated toward her. \"Ah,\" she cried, \"you look so cool.\"\n\nTheir eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space.\nWith an effort she glanced down at the table.\n\n\"You always look so cool,\" she repeated.\n\nShe had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was\nastounded. His mouth opened a little and he looked at Gatsby and then\nback at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as some one he knew a\nlong time ago.\n\n\"You resemble the advertisement of the man,\" she went on innocently.\n\"You know the advertisement of the man----\"\n\n\"All right,\" broke in Tom quickly, \"I'm perfectly willing to go to\ntown. Come on--we're all going to town.\"\n\nHe got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife.\nNo one moved.\n\n\"Come on!\" His temper cracked a little. \"What's the matter, anyhow?\nIf we're going to town let's start.\"\n\nHis hand, trembling with his effort at self control, bore to his lips the\nlast of his glass of ale. Daisy's voice got us to our feet and out on\nto the blazing gravel drive.\n\n\"Are we just going to go?\" she objected. \"Like this? Aren't we going to\nlet any one smoke a cigarette first?\"\n\n\"Everybody smoked all through lunch.\"\n\n\"Oh, let's have fun,\" she begged him. \"It's too hot to fuss.\"\n\nHe didn't answer.\n\n\"Have it your own way,\" she said. \"Come on, Jordan.\"\n\nThey went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling\nthe hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon hovered already\nin the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not\nbefore Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.\n\n\"Have you got your stables here?\" asked Gatsby with an effort.\n\n\"About a quarter of a mile down the road.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"I don't see the idea of going to town,\" broke out Tom savagely.\n\"Women get these notions in their heads----\"\n\n\"Shall we take anything to drink?\" called Daisy from an upper window.\n\n\"I'll get some whiskey,\" answered Tom. He went inside.\n\nGatsby turned to me rigidly:\n\n\"I can't say anything in his house, old sport.\"\n\n\"She's got an indiscreet voice,\" I remarked. \"It's full of----\"\n\nI hesitated.\n\n\"Her voice is full of money,\" he said suddenly.\n\nThat was it. I'd never understood before. It was full of money--that was\nthe inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the\ncymbals' song of it. . . . High in a white palace the king's daughter,\nthe golden girl. . . .\n\nTom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed\nby Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and\ncarrying light capes over their arms.\n\n\"Shall we all go in my car?\" suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green\nleather of the seat. \"I ought to have left it in the shade.\"\n\n\"Is it standard shift?\" demanded Tom.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, you take my coup\u00e9 and let me drive your car to town.\"\n\nThe suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.\n\n\"I don't think there's much gas,\" he objected.\n\n\"Plenty of gas,\" said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge.\n\"And if it runs out I can stop at a drug store. You can buy anything at a\ndrug store nowadays.\"\n\nA pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom\nfrowning and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar\nand vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in words,\npassed over Gatsby's face.\n\n\"Come on, Daisy,\" said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby's\ncar. \"I'll take you in this circus wagon.\"\n\nHe opened the door but she moved out from the circle of his arm.\n\n\"You take Nick and Jordan. We'll follow you in the coup\u00e9.\"\n\nShe walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan and\nTom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby's car, Tom pushed the\nunfamiliar gears tentatively and we shot off into the oppressive heat\nleaving them out of sight behind.\n\n\"Did you see that?\" demanded Tom.\n\n\"See what?\"\n\nHe looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known all\nalong.\n\n\"You think I'm pretty dumb, don't you?\" he suggested. \"Perhaps I am, but\nI have a--almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do.\nMaybe you don't believe that, but science----\"\n\nHe paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back from\nthe edge of the theoretical abyss.\n\n\"I've made a small investigation of this fellow,\" he continued. \"I could\nhave gone deeper if I'd known----\"\n\n\"Do you mean you've been to a medium?\" inquired Jordan humorously.\n\n\"What?\" Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. \"A medium?\"\n\n\"About Gatsby.\"\n\n\"About Gatsby! No, I haven't. I said I'd been making a small\ninvestigation of his past.\"\n\n\"And you found he was an Oxford man,\" said Jordan helpfully.\n\n\"An Oxford man!\" He was incredulous. \"Like hell he is! He wears a\npink suit.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless he's an Oxford man.\"\n\n\"Oxford, New Mexico,\" snorted Tom contemptuously, \"or something like\nthat.\"\n\n\"Listen, Tom. If you're such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?\"\ndemanded Jordan crossly.\n\n\"Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married--God knows\nwhere!\"\n\nWe were all irritable now with the fading ale and, aware of it,\nwe drove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg's faded\neyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby's caution about\ngasoline.\n\n\"We've got enough to get us to town,\" said Tom.\n\n\"But there's a garage right here,\" objected Jordan. \"I don't want to get\nstalled in this baking heat.\"\n\nTom threw on both brakes impatiently and we slid to an abrupt\ndusty stop under Wilson's sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged\nfrom the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.\n\n\"Let's have some gas!\" cried Tom roughly. \"What do you think we stopped\nfor--to admire the view?\"\n\n\"I'm sick,\" said Wilson without moving. \"I been sick all day.\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"I'm all run down.\"\n\n\"Well, shall I help myself?\" Tom demanded. \"You sounded well enough\non the phone.\"\n\nWith an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and,\nbreathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his face\nwas green.\n\n\"I didn't mean to interrupt your lunch,\" he said. \"But I need money\npretty bad and I was wondering what you were going to do with your\nold car.\"\n\n\"How do you like this one?\" inquired Tom. \"I bought it last week.\"\n\n\"It's a nice yellow one,\" said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.\n\n\"Like to buy it?\"\n\n\"Big chance,\" Wilson smiled faintly. \"No, but I could make some money\non the other.\"\n\n\"What do you want money for, all of a sudden?\"\n\n\"I've been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to\ngo west.\"\n\n\"Your wife does!\" exclaimed Tom, startled.\n\n\"She's been talking about it for ten years.\" He rested for a moment\nagainst the pump, shading his eyes. \"And now she's going whether she wants\nto or not. I'm going to get her away.\"\n\nThe coup\u00e9 flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a\nwaving hand.\n\n\"What do I owe you?\" demanded Tom harshly.\n\n\"I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,\" remarked\nWilson. \"That's why I want to get away. That's why I been bothering you\nabout the car.\"\n\n\"What do I owe you?\"\n\n\"Dollar twenty.\"\n\nThe relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had\na bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions\nhadn't alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some\nsort of life apart from him in another world and the shock had\nmade him physically sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made\na parallel discovery less than an hour before--and it occurred to me\nthat there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so\nprofound as the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so\nsick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty--as if he had just got\nsome poor girl with child.\n\n\"I'll let you have that car,\" said Tom. \"I'll send it over tomorrow\nafternoon.\"\n\nThat locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad\nglare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been\nwarned of something behind. Over the ashheaps the giant eyes of\nDoctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil but I perceived, after\na moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity\nfrom less than twenty feet away.\n\nIn one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside\na little and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So engrossed\nwas she that she had no consciousness of being observed and one\nemotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly\ndeveloping picture. Her expression was curiously familiar--it was an\nexpression I had often seen on women's faces but on Myrtle Wilson's\nface it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her\neyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan\nBaker, whom she took to be his wife.\n\n\nThere is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we\ndrove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his\nmistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping\nprecipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the\naccelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving\nWilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour,\nuntil, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of\nthe easygoing blue coup\u00e9.\n\n\"Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,\" suggested Jordan.\n\"I love New York on summer afternoons when every one's away. There's\nsomething very sensuous about it--overripe, as if all sorts of funny\nfruits were going to fall into your hands.\"\n\nThe word \"sensuous\" had the effect of further disquieting Tom but before\nhe could invent a protest the coup\u00e9 came to a stop and Daisy signalled us\nto draw up alongside.\n\n\"Where are we going?\" she cried.\n\n\"How about the movies?\"\n\n\"It's so hot,\" she complained. \"You go. We'll ride around and meet you\nafter.\" With an effort her wit rose faintly, \"We'll meet you on some\ncorner. I'll be the man smoking two cigarettes.\"\n\n\"We can't argue about it here,\" Tom said impatiently as a truck gave\nout a cursing whistle behind us. \"You follow me to the south side of\nCentral Park, in front of the Plaza.\"\n\nSeveral times he turned his head and looked back for their car,\nand if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into\nsight. I think he was afraid they would dart down a side street and out\nof his life forever.\n\nBut they didn't. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging\nthe parlor of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.\n\nThe prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into\nthat room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the\ncourse of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my\nlegs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back. The\nnotion originated with Daisy's suggestion that we hire five bathrooms\nand take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as \"a place to\nhave a mint julep.\" Each of us said over and over that it was a \"crazy\nidea\"--we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or\npretended to think, that we were being very funny. . . .\n\nThe room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four\no'clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from\nthe Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us,\nfixing her hair.\n\n\"It's a swell suite,\" whispered Jordan respectfully and every one\nlaughed.\n\n\"Open another window,\" commanded Daisy, without turning around.\n\n\"There aren't any more.\"\n\n\"Well, we'd better telephone for an axe----\"\n\n\"The thing to do is to forget about the heat,\" said Tom impatiently.\n\"You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.\"\n\nHe unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the towel and put it on the table.\n\n\"Why not let her alone, old sport?\" remarked Gatsby. \"You're the one that\nwanted to come to town.\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its nail\nand splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered \"Excuse me\"--but\nthis time no one laughed.\n\n\"I'll pick it up,\" I offered.\n\n\"I've got it.\" Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered \"Hum!\" in an\ninterested way, and tossed the book on a chair.\n\n\"That's a great expression of yours, isn't it?\" said Tom sharply.\n\n\"What is?\"\n\n\"All this 'old sport' business. Where'd you pick that up?\"\n\n\"Now see here, Tom,\" said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, \"if\nyou're going to make personal remarks I won't stay here a minute. Call\nup and order some ice for the mint julep.\"\n\nAs Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and\nwe were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn's Wedding March\nfrom the ballroom below.\n\n\"Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!\" cried Jordan dismally.\n\n\"Still--I was married in the middle of June,\" Daisy remembered,\n\"Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?\"\n\n\"Biloxi,\" he answered shortly.\n\n\"A man named Biloxi. 'Blocks' Biloxi, and he made boxes--that's a\nfact--and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.\"\n\n\"They carried him into my house,\" appended Jordan, \"because we lived\njust two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy\ntold him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died.\" After a\nmoment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, \"There\nwasn't any connection.\"\n\n\"I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,\" I remarked.\n\n\"That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left.\nHe gave me an aluminum putter that I use today.\"\n\nThe music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated\nin at the window, followed by intermittent cries of \"Yea--ea--ea!\"\nand finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.\n\n\"We're getting old,\" said Daisy. \"If we were young we'd rise and dance.\"\n\n\"Remember Biloxi,\" Jordan warned her. \"Where'd you know him, Tom?\"\n\n\"Biloxi?\" He concentrated with an effort. \"I didn't know him. He was a\nfriend of Daisy's.\"\n\n\"He was not,\" she denied. \"I'd never seen him before. He came down in\nthe private car.\"\n\n\"Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville.\nAsa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room\nfor him.\"\n\nJordan smiled.\n\n\"He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of\nyour class at Yale.\"\n\nTom and I looked at each other blankly.\n\n\"BilOxi?\"\n\n\"First place, we didn't have any president----\"\n\nGatsby's foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.\n\n\"By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you're an Oxford man.\"\n\n\"Not exactly.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.\"\n\n\"Yes--I went there.\"\n\nA pause. Then Tom's voice, incredulous and insulting:\n\n\"You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.\"\n\nAnother pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but\nthe silence was unbroken by his \"Thank you\" and the soft closing of the\ndoor. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.\n\n\"I told you I went there,\" said Gatsby.\n\n\"I heard you, but I'd like to know when.\"\n\n\"It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That's why I\ncan't really call myself an Oxford man.\"\n\nTom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all\nlooking at Gatsby.\n\n\"It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the\nArmistice,\" he continued. \"We could go to any of the universities in\nEngland or France.\"\n\nI wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those renewals\nof complete faith in him that I'd experienced before.\n\nDaisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.\n\n\"Open the whiskey, Tom,\" she ordered. \"And I'll make you a mint julep.\nThen you won't seem so stupid to yourself. . . . Look at the mint!\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" snapped Tom, \"I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more\nquestion.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" Gatsby said politely.\n\n\"What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?\"\n\nThey were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.\n\n\"He isn't causing a row.\" Daisy looked desperately from one to the\nother. \"You're causing a row. Please have a little self control.\"\n\n\"Self control!\" repeated Tom incredulously. \"I suppose the latest thing\nis to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife.\nWell, if that's the idea you can count me out. . . . Nowadays people begin\nby sneering at family life and family institutions and next they'll\nthrow everything overboard and have intermarriage between black\nand white.\"\n\nFlushed with his impassioned gibberish he saw himself standing alone on\nthe last barrier of civilization.\n\n\"We're all white here,\" murmured Jordan.\n\n\"I know I'm not very popular. I don't give big parties. I suppose\nyou've got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any\nfriends--in the modern world.\"\n\nAngry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened\nhis mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so complete.\n\n\"I've got something to tell YOU, old sport,----\" began Gatsby. But Daisy\nguessed at his intention.\n\n\"Please don't!\" she interrupted helplessly. \"Please let's all go home.\nWhy don't we all go home?\"\n\n\"That's a good idea.\" I got up. \"Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.\"\n\n\"I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.\"\n\n\"Your wife doesn't love you,\" said Gatsby. \"She's never loved you.\nShe loves me.\"\n\n\"You must be crazy!\" exclaimed Tom automatically.\n\nGatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.\n\n\"She never loved you, do you hear?\" he cried. \"She only married you\nbecause I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible\nmistake, but in her heart she never loved any one except me!\"\n\nAt this point Jordan and I tried to go but Tom and Gatsby insisted with\ncompetitive firmness that we remain--as though neither of them had\nanything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously\nof their emotions.\n\n\"Sit down Daisy.\" Tom's voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal\nnote. \"What's been going on? I want to hear all about it.\"\n\n\"I told you what's been going on,\" said Gatsby. \"Going on for five\nyears--and you didn't know.\"\n\nTom turned to Daisy sharply.\n\n\"You've been seeing this fellow for five years?\"\n\n\"Not seeing,\" said Gatsby. \"No, we couldn't meet. But both of us loved\neach other all that time, old sport, and you didn't know. I used to laugh\nsometimes--\"but there was no laughter in his eyes, \"to think that you\ndidn't know.\"\n\n\"Oh--that's all.\" Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman\nand leaned back in his chair.\n\n\"You're crazy!\" he exploded. \"I can't speak about what happened five years\nago, because I didn't know Daisy then--and I'll be damned if I see how you\ngot within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back\ndoor. But all the rest of that's a God Damned lie. Daisy loved me when\nshe married me and she loves me now.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Gatsby, shaking his head.\n\n\"She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas\nin her head and doesn't know what she's doing.\" He nodded sagely. \"And\nwhat's more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree\nand make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I\nlove her all the time.\"\n\n\"You're revolting,\" said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice,\ndropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: \"Do you\nknow why we left Chicago? I'm surprised that they didn't treat you to\nthe story of that little spree.\"\n\nGatsby walked over and stood beside her.\n\n\"Daisy, that's all over now,\" he said earnestly. \"It doesn't matter any\nmore. Just tell him the truth--that you never loved him--and it's all\nwiped out forever.\"\n\nShe looked at him blindly. \"Why,--how could I love him--possibly?\"\n\n\"You never loved him.\"\n\nShe hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal,\nas though she realized at last what she was doing--and as though she had\nnever, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done now.\nIt was too late.\n\n\"I never loved him,\" she said, with perceptible reluctance.\n\n\"Not at Kapiolani?\" demanded Tom suddenly.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nFrom the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up\non hot waves of air.\n\n\"Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes\ndry?\" There was a husky tenderness in his tone. \". . . Daisy?\"\n\n\"Please don't.\" Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it.\nShe looked at Gatsby. \"There, Jay,\" she said--but her hand as she tried\nto light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette and\nthe burning match on the carpet.\n\n\"Oh, you want too much!\" she cried to Gatsby. \"I love you now--isn't that\nenough? I can't help what's past.\" She began to sob helplessly.\n\"I did love him once--but I loved you too.\"\n\nGatsby's eyes opened and closed.\n\n\"You loved me TOO?\" he repeated.\n\n\"Even that's a lie,\" said Tom savagely. \"She didn't know you were alive.\nWhy,--there're things between Daisy and me that you'll never know,\nthings that neither of us can ever forget.\"\n\nThe words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.\n\n\"I want to speak to Daisy alone,\" he insisted. \"She's all excited now----\"\n\n\"Even alone I can't say I never loved Tom,\" she admitted in a pitiful\nvoice. \"It wouldn't be true.\"\n\n\"Of course it wouldn't,\" agreed Tom.\n\nShe turned to her husband.\n\n\"As if it mattered to you,\" she said.\n\n\"Of course it matters. I'm going to take better care of you from now on.\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. \"You're not\ngoing to take care of her any more.\"\n\n\"I'm not?\" Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to\ncontrol himself now. \"Why's that?\"\n\n\"Daisy's leaving you.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\n\"I am, though,\" she said with a visible effort.\n\n\"She's not leaving me!\" Tom's words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby.\n\"Certainly not for a common swindler who'd have to steal the ring he\nput on her finger.\"\n\n\"I won't stand this!\" cried Daisy. \"Oh, please let's get out.\"\n\n\"Who are you, anyhow?\" broke out Tom. \"You're one of that bunch that\nhangs around with Meyer Wolfsheim--that much I happen to know. I've made\na little investigation into your affairs--and I'll carry it further\ntomorrow.\"\n\n\"You can suit yourself about that, old sport.\" said Gatsby steadily.\n\n\"I found out what your 'drug stores' were.\" He turned to us and spoke\nrapidly. \"He and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of side-street drug stores\nhere and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. That's one of\nhis little stunts. I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw\nhim and I wasn't far wrong.\"\n\n\"What about it?\" said Gatsby politely. \"I guess your friend Walter Chase\nwasn't too proud to come in on it.\"\n\n\"And you left him in the lurch, didn't you? You let him go to jail for\na month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the subject\nof YOU.\"\n\n\"He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old\nsport.\"\n\n\"Don't you call me 'old sport'!\" cried Tom. Gatsby said nothing.\n\"Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfsheim scared\nhim into shutting his mouth.\"\n\nThat unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby's face.\n\n\"That drug store business was just small change,\" continued Tom slowly,\n\"but you've got something on now that Walter's afraid to tell me\nabout.\"\n\nI glanced at Daisy who was staring terrified between Gatsby\nand her husband and at Jordan who had begun to balance an invisible\nbut absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to\nGatsby--and was startled at his expression. He looked--and this is said\nin all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden--as if he had\n\"killed a man.\" For a moment the set of his face could be described in\njust that fantastic way.\n\nIt passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything,\ndefending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with\nevery word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave\nthat up and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped\naway, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling\nunhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.\n\nThe voice begged again to go.\n\n\"PLEASE, Tom! I can't stand this any more.\"\n\nHer frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage\nshe had had, were definitely gone.\n\n\"You two start on home, Daisy,\" said Tom. \"In Mr. Gatsby's car.\"\n\nShe looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous scorn.\n\n\"Go on. He won't annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous\nlittle flirtation is over.\"\n\nThey were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental, isolated,\nlike ghosts even from our pity.\n\nAfter a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of\nwhiskey in the towel.\n\n\"Want any of this stuff? Jordan? . . . Nick?\"\n\nI didn't answer.\n\n\"Nick?\" He asked again.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Want any?\"\n\n\"No . . . I just remembered that today's my birthday.\"\n\nI was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous menacing road of a\nnew decade.\n\nIt was seven o'clock when we got into the coup\u00e9 with him and started\nfor Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but his\nvoice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamor on the\nsidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead. Human sympathy\nhas its limits and we were content to let all their tragic arguments\nfade with the city lights behind. Thirty--the promise of a decade\nof loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning\nbrief-case of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside\nme who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten\ndreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face\nfell lazily against my coat's shoulder and the formidable stroke of\nthirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.\n\nSo we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.\n\n\nThe young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the\nashheaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had slept through\nthe heat until after five, when he strolled over to the garage and\nfound George Wilson sick in his office--really sick, pale as his own\npale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go to bed but\nWilson refused, saying that he'd miss a lot of business if he did.\nWhile his neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke\nout overhead.\n\n\"I've got my wife locked in up there,\" explained Wilson calmly.\n\"She's going to stay there till the day after tomorrow and then we're\ngoing to move away.\"\n\nMichaelis was astonished; they had been neighbors for four years and\nWilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement. Generally\nhe was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn't working he sat on a\nchair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed\nalong the road. When any one spoke to him he invariably laughed in an\nagreeable, colorless way. He was his wife's man and not his own.\n\nSo naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson\nwouldn't say a word--instead he began to throw curious, suspicious\nglances at his visitor and ask him what he'd been doing at certain\ntimes on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy some\nworkmen came past the door bound for his restaurant and Michaelis took\nthe opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he didn't.\nHe supposed he forgot to, that's all. When he came outside again\na little after seven he was reminded of the conversation because he\nheard Mrs. Wilson's voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in the garage.\n\n\"Beat me!\" he heard her cry. \"Throw me down and beat me, you dirty\nlittle coward!\"\n\nA moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and\nshouting; before he could move from his door the business was over.\n\nThe \"death car\" as the newspapers called it, didn't stop; it came out\nof the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment and then\ndisappeared around the next bend. Michaelis wasn't even sure of its\ncolor--he told the first policeman that it was light green. The other\ncar, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards\nbeyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life\nviolently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick, dark\nblood with the dust.\n\nMichaelis and this man reached her first but when they had torn open\nher shirtwaist still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left\nbreast was swinging loose like a flap and there was no need to listen\nfor the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped at the\ncorners as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous\nvitality she had stored so long.\n\n\nWe saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still\nsome distance away.\n\n\"Wreck!\" said Tom. \"That's good. Wilson'll have a little business\nat last.\"\n\nHe slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping until,\nas we came nearer, the hushed intent faces of the people at the garage\ndoor made him automatically put on the brakes.\n\n\"We'll take a look,\" he said doubtfully, \"just a look.\"\n\nI became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly\nfrom the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coup\u00e9 and walked\ntoward the door resolved itself into the words \"Oh, my God!\" uttered over\nand over in a gasping moan.\n\n\"There's some bad trouble here,\" said Tom excitedly.\n\nHe reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the\ngarage which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging wire basket\noverhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat and with a violent\nthrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through.\n\nThe circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it\nwas a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals\ndisarranged the line and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.\n\nMyrtle Wilson's body wrapped in a blanket and then in another\nblanket as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night lay on a\nwork table by the wall and Tom, with his back to us, was bending over\nit, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down\nnames with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I\ncouldn't find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed\nclamorously through the bare garage--then I saw Wilson standing on the\nraised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to\nthe doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low\nvoice and attempting from time to time to lay a hand on his shoulder,\nbut Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly from the\nswinging light to the laden table by the wall and then jerk back to\nthe light again and he gave out incessantly his high horrible call.\n\n\"O, my Ga-od! O, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!\"\n\nPresently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and after staring around the\ngarage with glazed eyes addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the\npoliceman.\n\n\"M-a-v--\" the policeman was saying, \"--o----\"\n\n\"No,--r--\" corrected the man, \"M-a-v-r-o----\"\n\n\"Listen to me!\" muttered Tom fiercely.\n\n\"r--\" said the policeman, \"o----\"\n\n\"g----\"\n\n\"g--\" He looked up as Tom's broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder.\n\"What you want, fella?\"\n\n\"What happened--that's what I want to know!\"\n\n\"Auto hit her. Ins'antly killed.\"\n\n\"Instantly killed,\" repeated Tom, staring.\n\n\"She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn't even stopus car.\"\n\n\"There was two cars,\" said Michaelis, \"one comin', one goin', see?\"\n\n\"Going where?\" asked the policeman keenly.\n\n\"One goin' each way. Well, she--\" His hand rose toward the blankets but\nstopped half way and fell to his side, \"--she ran out there an' the one\ncomin' from N'York knock right into her goin' thirty or forty miles an\nhour.\"\n\n\"What's the name of this place here?\" demanded the officer.\n\n\"Hasn't got any name.\"\n\nA pale, well-dressed Negro stepped near.\n\n\"It was a yellow car,\" he said, \"big yellow car. New.\"\n\n\"See the accident?\" asked the policeman.\n\n\"No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster'n forty. Going\nfifty, sixty.\"\n\n\"Come here and let's have your name. Look out now. I want to get his\nname.\"\n\nSome words of this conversation must have reached Wilson swaying\nin the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among\nhis gasping cries.\n\n\"You don't have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of\ncar it was!\"\n\nWatching Tom I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten\nunder his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and standing\nin front of him seized him firmly by the upper arms.\n\n\"You've got to pull yourself together,\" he said with soothing\ngruffness.\n\nWilson's eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then\nwould have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.\n\n\"Listen,\" said Tom, shaking him a little. \"I just got here a minute ago,\nfrom New York. I was bringing you that coup\u00e9 we've been talking about.\nThat yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn't mine, do you hear? I\nhaven't seen it all afternoon.\"\n\nOnly the Negro and I were near enough to hear what he said but the\npoliceman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent\neyes.\n\n\"What's all that?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I'm a friend of his.\" Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on\nWilson's body. \"He says he knows the car that did it. . . . It was a yellow\ncar.\"\n\nSome dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.\n\n\"And what color's your car?\"\n\n\"It's a blue car, a coup\u00e9.\"\n\n\"We've come straight from New York,\" I said.\n\nSome one who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this and\nthe policeman turned away.\n\n\"Now, if you'll let me have that name again correct----\"\n\nPicking up Wilson like a doll Tom carried him into the office,\nset him down in a chair and came back.\n\n\"If somebody'll come here and sit with him!\" he snapped\nauthoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced\nat each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the\ndoor on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the\ntable. As he passed close to me he whispered \"Let's get out.\"\n\nSelf consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we\npushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor,\ncase in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.\n\nTom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend--then his foot came down\nhard and the coup\u00e9 raced along through the night. In a little while I\nheard a low husky sob and saw that the tears were overflowing down his\nface.\n\n\"The God Damn coward!\" he whimpered. \"He didn't even stop his car.\"\n\n\nThe Buchanans' house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling\ntrees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor\nwhere two windows bloomed with light among the vines.\n\n\"Daisy's home,\" he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and\nfrowned slightly.\n\n\"I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There's nothing we can\ndo tonight.\"\n\nA change had come over him and he spoke gravely, and with decision.\nAs we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of\nthe situation in a few brisk phrases.\n\n\"I'll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you're waiting\nyou and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some\nsupper--if you want any.\" He opened the door. \"Come in.\"\n\n\"No thanks. But I'd be glad if you'd order me the taxi. I'll wait\noutside.\"\n\nJordan put her hand on my arm.\n\n\"Won't you come in, Nick?\"\n\n\"No thanks.\"\n\nI was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan lingered\nfor a moment more.\n\n\"It's only half past nine,\" she said.\n\nI'd be damned if I'd go in; I'd had enough of all of them for one day\nand suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of\nthis in my expression for she turned abruptly away and ran up the\nporch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head\nin my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler's\nvoice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the\nhouse intending to wait by the gate.\n\nI hadn't gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from\nbetween two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird by that\ntime because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his\npink suit under the moon.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Just standing here, old sport.\"\n\nSomehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was going\nto rob the house in a moment; I wouldn't have been surprised to see\nsinister faces, the faces of \"Wolfsheim's people,\" behind him in the\ndark shrubbery.\n\n\"Did you see any trouble on the road?\" he asked after a minute.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe hesitated.\n\n\"Was she killed?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It's better that the shock\nshould all come at once. She stood it pretty well.\"\n\nHe spoke as if Daisy's reaction was the only thing that mattered.\n\n\"I got to West Egg by a side road,\" he went on, \"and left the car in my\ngarage. I don't think anybody saw us but of course I can't be sure.\"\n\nI disliked him so much by this time that I didn't find it necessary to\ntell him he was wrong.\n\n\"Who was the woman?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it\nhappen?\"\n\n\"Well, I tried to swing the wheel----\" He broke off, and suddenly I\nguessed at the truth.\n\n\"Was Daisy driving?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said after a moment, \"but of course I'll say I was. You see,\nwhen we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would\nsteady her to drive--and this woman rushed out at us just as we were\npassing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute but it\nseemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody\nshe knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other\ncar, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second my hand\nreached the wheel I felt the shock--it must have killed her instantly.\"\n\n\"It ripped her open----\"\n\n\"Don't tell me, old sport.\" He winced. \"Anyhow--Daisy stepped on it.\nI tried to make her stop, but she couldn't so I pulled on the emergency\nbrake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.\n\n\"She'll be all right tomorrow,\" he said presently. \"I'm just going to\nwait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness\nthis afternoon. She's locked herself into her room and if he tries any\nbrutality she's going to turn the light out and on again.\"\n\n\"He won't touch her,\" I said. \"He's not thinking about her.\"\n\n\"I don't trust him, old sport.\"\n\n\"How long are you going to wait?\"\n\n\"All night if necessary. Anyhow till they all go to bed.\"\n\nA new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had\nbeen driving. He might think he saw a connection in it--he might think\nanything. I looked at the house: there were two or three bright windows\ndownstairs and the pink glow from Daisy's room on the second floor.\n\n\"You wait here,\" I said. \"I'll see if there's any sign of a commotion.\"\n\nI walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly\nand tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains were open,\nand I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where we had dined\nthat June night three months before I came to a small rectangle of light\nwhich I guessed was the pantry window. The blind was drawn but I found\na rift at the sill.\n\nDaisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table\nwith a plate of cold fried chicken between them and two bottles of\nale. He was talking intently across the table at her and in his\nearnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a\nwhile she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.\n\nThey weren't happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the\nale--and yet they weren't unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air\nof natural intimacy about the picture and anybody would have said that\nthey were conspiring together.\n\nAs I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the\ndark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in\nthe drive.\n\n\"Is it all quiet up there?\" he asked anxiously.\n\n\"Yes, it's all quiet.\" I hesitated. \"You'd better come home and get\nsome sleep.\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.\"\n\nHe put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his\nscrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of\nthe vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the\nmoonlight--watching over nothing.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\n\n\nI couldn't sleep all night; a fog-horn was groaning incessantly on the\nSound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage\nfrightening dreams. Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby's drive\nand immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress--I felt that I\nhad something to tell him, something to warn him about and morning\nwould be too late.\n\nCrossing his lawn I saw that his front door was still open and he was\nleaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.\n\n\"Nothing happened,\" he said wanly. \"I waited, and about four o'clock she\ncame to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out\nthe light.\"\n\nHis house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we\nhunted through the great rooms for cigarettes. We pushed aside curtains\nthat were like pavilions and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for\nelectric light switches--once I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the\nkeys of a ghostly piano. There was an inexplicable amount of dust\neverywhere and the rooms were musty as though they hadn't been aired for\nmany days. I found the humidor on an unfamiliar table with two stale dry\ncigarettes inside. Throwing open the French windows of the\ndrawing-room we sat smoking out into the darkness.\n\n\"You ought to go away,\" I said. \"It's pretty certain they'll trace\nyour car.\"\n\n\"Go away NOW, old sport?\"\n\n\"Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal.\"\n\nHe wouldn't consider it. He couldn't possibly leave Daisy until he knew\nwhat she was going to do. He was clutching at some last hope and I\ncouldn't bear to shake him free.\n\nIt was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with\nDan Cody--told it to me because \"Jay Gatsby\" had broken up like glass\nagainst Tom's hard malice and the long secret extravaganza was played\nout. I think that he would have acknowledged anything, now, without\nreserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.\n\nShe was the first \"nice\" girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed\ncapacities he had come in contact with such people but always\nwith indiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly\ndesirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers\nfrom Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him--he had never been\nin such a beautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless\nintensity was that Daisy lived there--it was as casual a thing to her\nas his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it,\na hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other\nbedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its\ncorridors and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in\nlavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year's shining\nmotor cars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered. It\nexcited him too that many men had already loved Daisy--it increased\nher value in his eyes. He felt their presence all about the house,\npervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.\n\nBut he knew that he was in Daisy's house by a colossal accident.\nHowever glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a\npenniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible\ncloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he made\nthe most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and\nunscrupulously--eventually he took Daisy one still October night,\ntook her because he had no real right to touch her hand.\n\nHe might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under\nfalse pretenses. I don't mean that he had traded on his phantom\nmillions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he\nlet her believe that he was a person from much the same stratum as\nherself--that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of\nfact he had no such facilities--he had no comfortable family standing\nbehind him and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government\nto be blown anywhere about the world.\n\nBut he didn't despise himself and it didn't turn out as he had\nimagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go--but\nnow he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail.\nHe knew that Daisy was extraordinary but he didn't realize just how\nextraordinary a \"nice\" girl could be. She vanished into her rich\nhouse, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby--nothing. He felt\nmarried to her, that was all.\n\nWhen they met again two days later it was Gatsby who was breathless,\nwho was somehow betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought\nluxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably\nas she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth.\nShe had caught a cold and it made her voice huskier and more charming\nthan ever and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery\nthat wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes\nand of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot\nstruggles of the poor.\n\n\n\"I can't describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her,\nold sport. I even hoped for a while that she'd throw me over, but she\ndidn't, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot\nbecause I knew different things from her. . . . Well, there I was,\nway off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and\nall of a sudden I didn't care. What was the use of doing great\nthings if I could have a better time telling her what I was going\nto do?\"\n\nOn the last afternoon before he went abroad he sat with Daisy in\nhis arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day with fire\nin the room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he\nchanged his arm a little and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The\nafternoon had made them tranquil for a while as if to give them a deep\nmemory for the long parting the next day promised. They had never been\ncloser in their month of love nor communicated more profoundly one\nwith another than when she brushed silent lips against his coat's\nshoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though\nshe were asleep.\n\n\nHe did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before he went\nto the front and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and\nthe command of the divisional machine guns. After the Armistice\nhe tried frantically to get home but some complication or\nmisunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now--there\nwas a quality of nervous despair in Daisy's letters. She didn't see why\nhe couldn't come. She was feeling the pressure of the world outside\nand she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be\nreassured that she was doing the right thing after all.\n\nFor Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids\nand pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of\nthe year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new\ntunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the\n\"Beale Street Blues\" while a hundred pairs of golden and silver\nslippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were\nalways rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low sweet fever,\nwhile fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the\nsad horns around the floor.\n\nThrough this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the\nseason; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with\nhalf a dozen men and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and\nchiffon of an evening dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor\nbeside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a\ndecision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately--and the decision\nmust be made by some force--of love, of money, of unquestionable\npracticality--that was close at hand.\n\nThat force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom\nBuchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his\nposition and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certain\nstruggle and a certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby while he was\nstill at Oxford.\n\n\nIt was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of\nthe windows downstairs, filling the house with grey turning,\ngold turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew\nand ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a\nslow pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool\nlovely day.\n\n\"I don't think she ever loved him.\" Gatsby turned around from a window\nand looked at me challengingly. \"You must remember, old sport, she was\nvery excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that\nfrightened her--that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper.\nAnd the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.\"\n\nHe sat down gloomily.\n\n\"Of course she might have loved him, just for a minute, when they were\nfirst married--and loved me more even then, do you see?\"\n\nSuddenly he came out with a curious remark:\n\n\"In any case,\" he said, \"it was just personal.\"\n\nWhat could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in\nhis conception of the affair that couldn't be measured?\n\nHe came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding\ntrip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville\non the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week, walking the\nstreets where their footsteps had clicked together through the\nNovember night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which\nthey had driven in her white car. Just as Daisy's house had always\nseemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses so his\nidea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded\nwith a melancholy beauty.\n\nHe left feeling that if he had searched harder he might have found\nher--that he was leaving her behind. The day-coach--he was penniless\nnow--was hot. He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a\nfolding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar\nbuildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow\ntrolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have\nseen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.\n\nThe track curved and now it was going away from the sun which, as it\nsank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing\ncity where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand\ndesperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of\nthe spot that she had made lovely for him. But it was all going by too\nfast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of\nit, the freshest and the best, forever.\n\n\nIt was nine o'clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the\nporch. The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there\nwas an autumn flavor in the air. The gardener, the last one of Gatsby's\nformer servants, came to the foot of the steps.\n\n\"I'm going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. Leaves'll start falling\npretty soon and then there's always trouble with the pipes.\"\n\n\"Don't do it today,\" Gatsby answered. He turned to me apologetically.\n\"You know, old sport, I've never used that pool all summer?\"\n\nI looked at my watch and stood up.\n\n\"Twelve minutes to my train.\"\n\nI didn't want to go to the city. I wasn't worth a decent stroke of work\nbut it was more than that--I didn't want to leave Gatsby. I missed that\ntrain, and then another, before I could get myself away.\n\n\"I'll call you up,\" I said finally.\n\n\"Do, old sport.\"\n\n\"I'll call you about noon.\"\n\nWe walked slowly down the steps.\n\n\"I suppose Daisy'll call too.\" He looked at me anxiously as if he\nhoped I'd corroborate this.\n\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\n\"Well--goodbye.\"\n\nWe shook hands and I started away. Just before I reached the hedge I\nremembered something and turned around.\n\n\"They're a rotten crowd,\" I shouted across the lawn. \"You're worth the\nwhole damn bunch put together.\"\n\nI've always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever gave\nhim, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end. First he nodded\npolitely, and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding\nsmile, as if we'd been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time.\nHis gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of color against the\nwhite steps and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral\nhome three months before. The lawn and drive had been crowded with the\nfaces of those who guessed at his corruption--and he had stood on those\nsteps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye.\n\nI thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thanking him for\nthat--I and the others.\n\n\"Goodbye,\" I called. \"I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.\"\n\n\nUp in the city I tried for a while to list the quotations on an\ninterminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair.\nJust before noon the phone woke me and I started up with sweat\nbreaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker; she often called\nme up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements\nbetween hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find\nin any other way. Usually her voice came over the wire as something\nfresh and cool as if a divot from a green golf links had come\nsailing in at the office window but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.\n\n\"I've left Daisy's house,\" she said. \"I'm at Hempstead and I'm going down\nto Southampton this afternoon.\"\n\nProbably it had been tactful to leave Daisy's house, but the act\nannoyed me and her next remark made me rigid.\n\n\"You weren't so nice to me last night.\"\n\n\"How could it have mattered then?\"\n\nSilence for a moment. Then--\n\n\"However--I want to see you.\"\n\n\"I want to see you too.\"\n\n\"Suppose I don't go to Southampton, and come into town this afternoon?\"\n\n\"No--I don't think this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\"It's impossible this afternoon. Various----\"\n\nWe talked like that for a while and then abruptly we weren't talking any\nlonger. I don't know which of us hung up with a sharp click but I know I\ndidn't care. I couldn't have talked to her across a tea-table that day if\nI never talked to her again in this world.\n\nI called Gatsby's house a few minutes later, but the line was busy. I\ntried four times; finally an exasperated central told me the wire was\nbeing kept open for long distance from Detroit. Taking out my\ntime-table I drew a small circle around the three-fifty train. Then I\nleaned back in my chair and tried to think. It was just noon.\n\n\nWhen I passed the ashheaps on the train that morning I had crossed\ndeliberately to the other side of the car. I suppose there'd be a\ncurious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark\nspots in the dust and some garrulous man telling over and over what\nhad happened until it became less and less real even to him and he\ncould tell it no longer and Myrtle Wilson's tragic achievement was\nforgotten. Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at the\ngarage after we left there the night before.\n\nThey had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine. She must\nhave broken her rule against drinking that night for when she\narrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the\nambulance had already gone to Flushing. When they convinced her of\nthis she immediately fainted as if that was the intolerable part of\nthe affair. Someone kind or curious took her in his car and drove\nher in the wake of her sister's body.\n\nUntil long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front\nof the garage while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the\ncouch inside. For a while the door of the office was open and\neveryone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it.\nFinally someone said it was a shame and closed the door. Michaelis and\nseveral other men were with him--first four or five men, later two or\nthree men. Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger to wait\nthere fifteen minutes longer while he went back to his own place and made\na pot of coffee. After that he stayed there alone with Wilson until dawn.\n\nAbout three o'clock the quality of Wilson's incoherent muttering\nchanged--he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car. He\nannounced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged\nto, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had\ncome from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen.\n\nBut when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry \"Oh,\nmy God!\" again in his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt\nto distract him.\n\n\"How long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sit\nstill a minute and answer my question. How long have you been married?\"\n\n\"Twelve years.\"\n\n\"Ever had any children? Come on, George, sit still--I asked you a\nquestion. Did you ever have any children?\"\n\nThe hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light and whenever\nMichaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him\nlike the car that hadn't stopped a few hours before. He didn't like to go\ninto the garage because the work bench was stained where the body had\nbeen lying so he moved uncomfortably around the office--he knew every\nobject in it before morning--and from time to time sat down beside Wilson\ntrying to keep him more quiet.\n\n\"Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if you\nhaven't been there for a long time? Maybe I could call up the church\nand get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?\"\n\n\"Don't belong to any.\"\n\n\"You ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must have\ngone to church once. Didn't you get married in a church? Listen, George,\nlisten to me. Didn't you get married in a church?\"\n\n\"That was a long time ago.\"\n\nThe effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking--for a moment he\nwas silent. Then the same half knowing, half bewildered look came back\ninto his faded eyes.\n\n\"Look in the drawer there,\" he said, pointing at the desk.\n\n\"Which drawer?\"\n\n\"That drawer--that one.\"\n\nMichaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it but\na small expensive dog leash made of leather and braided silver. It was\napparently new.\n\n\"This?\" he inquired, holding it up.\n\nWilson stared and nodded.\n\n\"I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it but I\nknew it was something funny.\"\n\n\"You mean your wife bought it?\"\n\n\"She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.\"\n\nMichaelis didn't see anything odd in that and he gave Wilson a dozen\nreasons why his wife might have bought the dog leash. But conceivably\nWilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle,\nbecause he began saying \"Oh, my God!\" again in a whisper--his comforter\nleft several explanations in the air.\n\n\"Then he killed her,\" said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly.\n\n\"Who did?\"\n\n\"I have a way of finding out.\"\n\n\"You're morbid, George,\" said his friend. \"This has been a strain to you\nand you don't know what you're saying. You'd better try and sit quiet\ntill morning.\"\n\n\"He murdered her.\"\n\n\"It was an accident, George.\"\n\nWilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly\nwith the ghost of a superior \"Hm!\"\n\n\"I know,\" he said definitely, \"I'm one of these trusting fellas and I\ndon't think any harm to NObody, but when I get to know a thing I know\nit. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he\nwouldn't stop.\"\n\nMichaelis had seen this too but it hadn't occurred to him that there was\nany special significance in it. He believed that Mrs. Wilson had been\nrunning away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any\nparticular car.\n\n\"How could she of been like that?\"\n\n\"She's a deep one,\" said Wilson, as if that answered the question.\n\"Ah-h-h----\"\n\nHe began to rock again and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in\nhis hand.\n\n\"Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?\"\n\nThis was a forlorn hope--he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend:\nthere was not enough of him for his wife. He was glad a little later when\nhe noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and\nrealized that dawn wasn't far off. About five o'clock it was blue enough\noutside to snap off the light.\n\nWilson's glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps, where small grey\nclouds took on fantastic shape and scurried here and there in the faint\ndawn wind.\n\n\"I spoke to her,\" he muttered, after a long silence. \"I told her she might\nfool me but she couldn't fool God. I took her to the window--\" With an\neffort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face\npressed against it, \"--and I said 'God knows what you've been doing,\neverything you've been doing. You may fool me but you can't fool God!' \"\n\nStanding behind him Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the\neyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg which had just emerged pale and enormous\nfrom the dissolving night.\n\n\"God sees everything,\" repeated Wilson.\n\n\"That's an advertisement,\" Michaelis assured him. Something made him turn\naway from the window and look back into the room. But Wilson stood there a\nlong time, his face close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight.\n\n\nBy six o'clock Michaelis was worn out and grateful for the sound of a\ncar stopping outside. It was one of the watchers of the night before\nwho had promised to come back so he cooked breakfast for three which\nhe and the other man ate together. Wilson was quieter now and Michaelis\nwent home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the\ngarage Wilson was gone.\n\nHis movements--he was on foot all the time--were afterward traced to Port\nRoosevelt and then to Gad's Hill where he bought a sandwich that he\ndidn't eat and a cup of coffee. He must have been tired and walking\nslowly for he didn't reach Gad's Hill until noon. Thus far there was\nno difficulty in accounting for his time--there were boys who had seen a\nman \"acting sort of crazy\" and motorists at whom he stared oddly from\nthe side of the road. Then for three hours he disappeared from view.\nThe police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he \"had\na way of finding out,\" supposed that he spent that time going from\ngarage to garage thereabouts inquiring for a yellow car. On the other\nhand no garage man who had seen him ever came forward--and perhaps he\nhad an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to know. By\nhalf past two he was in West Egg where he asked someone the way to\nGatsby's house. So by that time he knew Gatsby's name.\n\n\nAt two o'clock Gatsby put on his bathing suit and left word with the\nbutler that if any one phoned word was to be brought to him at the\npool. He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused\nhis guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him pump it up.\nThen he gave instructions that the open car wasn't to be taken out\nunder any circumstances--and this was strange because the front right\nfender needed repair.\n\nGatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once he\nstopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he\nneeded help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among\nthe yellowing trees.\n\nNo telephone message arrived but the butler went without his sleep and\nwaited for it until four o'clock--until long after there was any one to\ngive it to if it came. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn't\nbelieve it would come and perhaps he no longer cared. If that was true\nhe must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high\nprice for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up\nat an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he\nfound what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was\nupon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being\nreal, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted\nfortuitously about . . . like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward\nhim through the amorphous trees.\n\nThe chauffeur--he was one of Wolfsheim's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s--heard the\nshots--afterward he could only say that he hadn't thought anything much\nabout them. I drove from the station directly to Gatsby's house and my\nrushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed any\none. But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a word said, four\nof us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener and I, hurried down to the pool.\n\nThere was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the\nfresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other.\nWith little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden\nmattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that\nscarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental\ncourse with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves\nrevolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of compass, a thin red circle\nin the water.\n\nIt was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener\nsaw Wilson's body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was\ncomplete.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\n\n\nAfter two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the\nnext day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and\nnewspaper men in and out of Gatsby's front door. A rope stretched\nacross the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but\nlittle boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard and\nthere were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the pool.\nSomeone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the\nexpression \"mad man\" as he bent over Wilson's body that afternoon, and\nthe adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper\nreports next morning.\n\nMost of those reports were a nightmare--grotesque, circumstantial,\neager and untrue. When Michaelis's testimony at the inquest brought to\nlight Wilson's suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would\nshortly be served up in racy pasquinade--but Catherine, who might have\nsaid anything, didn't say a word. She showed a surprising amount of\ncharacter about it too--looked at the coroner with determined eyes under\nthat corrected brow of hers and swore that her sister had never seen\nGatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her\nsister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced herself of it\nand cried into her handkerchief as if the very suggestion was more\nthan she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a man \"deranged by\ngrief\" in order that the case might remain in its simplest form. And\nit rested there.\n\nBut all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself on\nGatsby's side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of\nthe catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and\nevery practical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and\nconfused; then, as he lay in his house and didn't move or breathe or\nspeak hour upon hour it grew upon me that I was responsible, because no\none else was interested--interested, I mean, with that intense personal\ninterest to which every one has some vague right at the end.\n\nI called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her\ninstinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away\nearly that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.\n\n\"Left no address?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Say when they'd be back?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Any idea where they are? How I could reach them?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Can't say.\"\n\nI wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where he\nlay and reassure him: \"I'll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don't worry.\nJust trust me and I'll get somebody for you----\"\n\nMeyer Wolfsheim's name wasn't in the phone book. The butler gave me his\noffice address on Broadway and I called Information, but by the time I\nhad the number it was long after five and no one answered the phone.\n\n\"Will you ring again?\"\n\n\"I've rung them three times.\"\n\n\"It's very important.\"\n\n\"Sorry. I'm afraid no one's there.\"\n\nI went back to the drawing room and thought for an instant that they were\nchance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it. But\nas they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with unmoved eyes,\nhis protest continued in my brain.\n\n\"Look here, old sport, you've got to get somebody for me. You've got\nto try hard. I can't go through this alone.\"\n\nSome one started to ask me questions but I broke away and going upstairs\nlooked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk--he'd never told me\ndefinitely that his parents were dead. But there was nothing--only the\npicture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence staring down from\nthe wall.\n\nNext morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfsheim\nwhich asked for information and urged him to come out on the next\ntrain. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure he'd\nstart when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there'd be a wire\nfrom Daisy before noon--but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfsheim arrived, no\none arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men.\nWhen the butler brought back Wolfsheim's answer I began to have a\nfeeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me\nagainst them all.\n\n\n_Dear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my\nlife to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a mad\nact as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down now as\nI am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in\nthis thing now. If there is anything I can do a little later let me\nknow in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when I hear about a\nthing like this and am completely knocked down and out.\n\n                                        Yours truly\n                                                      MEYER Wolfsheim_\n\nand then hasty addenda beneath:\n\n_Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all._\n\n\nWhen the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was\ncalling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came\nthrough as a man's voice, very thin and far away.\n\n\"This is Slagle speaking. . . .\"\n\n\"Yes?\" The name was unfamiliar.\n\n\"Hell of a note, isn't it? Get my wire?\"\n\n\"There haven't been any wires.\"\n\n\"Young Parke's in trouble,\" he said rapidly. \"They picked him up when he\nhanded the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New York\ngiving 'em the numbers just five minutes before. What d'you know about\nthat, hey? You never can tell in these hick towns----\"\n\n\"Hello!\" I interrupted breathlessly. \"Look here--this isn't Mr. Gatsby.\nMr. Gatsby's dead.\"\n\nThere was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an\nexclamation . . . then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.\n\n\nI think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz\narrived from a town in Minnesota. It said only that the sender was\nleaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.\n\nIt was Gatsby's father, a solemn old man very helpless and dismayed,\nbundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day. His\neyes leaked continuously with excitement and when I took the bag and\numbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse\ngrey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was on the\npoint of collapse so I took him into the music room and made him sit\ndown while I sent for something to eat. But he wouldn't eat and the\nglass of milk spilled from his trembling hand.\n\n\"I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,\" he said. \"It was all in the Chicago\nnewspaper. I started right away.\"\n\n\"I didn't know how to reach you.\"\n\nHis eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room.\n\n\"It was a mad man,\" he said. \"He must have been mad.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you like some coffee?\" I urged him.\n\n\"I don't want anything. I'm all right now, Mr.----\"\n\n\"Carraway.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?\"\n\nI took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him there.\nSome little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall;\nwhen I told them who had arrived they went reluctantly away.\n\nAfter a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth\najar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and\nunpunctual tears. He had reached an age where death no longer has the\nquality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the\nfirst time and saw the height and splendor of the hall and the great\nrooms opening out from it into other rooms his grief began to be mixed\nwith an awed pride. I helped him to a bedroom upstairs; while he took\noff his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been\ndeferred until he came.\n\n\"I didn't know what you'd want, Mr. Gatsby----\"\n\n\"Gatz is my name.\"\n\n\"--Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body west.\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position in\nthe East. Were you a friend of my boy's, Mr.--?\"\n\n\"We were close friends.\"\n\n\"He had a big future before him, you know. He was only a young man but\nhe had a lot of brain power here.\"\n\nHe touched his head impressively and I nodded.\n\n\"If he'd of lived he'd of been a great man. A man like James J. Hill.\nHe'd of helped build up the country.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" I said, uncomfortably.\n\nHe fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the bed,\nand lay down stiffly--was instantly asleep.\n\nThat night an obviously frightened person called up and demanded to know\nwho I was before he would give his name.\n\n\"This is Mr. Carraway,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh--\" He sounded relieved. \"This is Klipspringer.\"\n\nI was relieved too for that seemed to promise another friend\nat Gatsby's grave. I didn't want it to be in the papers and draw\na sightseeing crowd so I'd been calling up a few people myself.\nThey were hard to find.\n\n\"The funeral's tomorrow,\" I said. \"Three o'clock, here at the house.\nI wish you'd tell anybody who'd be interested.\"\n\n\"Oh, I will,\" he broke out hastily. \"Of course I'm not likely to see\nanybody, but if I do.\"\n\nHis tone made me suspicious.\n\n\"Of course you'll be there yourself.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll certainly try. What I called up about is----\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" I interrupted. \"How about saying you'll come?\"\n\n\"Well, the fact is--the truth of the matter is that I'm staying with\nsome people up here in Greenwich and they rather expect me to be with\nthem tomorrow. In fact there's a sort of picnic or something.\nOf course I'll do my very best to get away.\"\n\nI ejaculated an unrestrained \"Huh!\" and he must have heard me for he went\non nervously:\n\n\"What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. I wonder if\nit'd be too much trouble to have the butler send them on. You\nsee they're tennis shoes and I'm sort of helpless without them. My\naddress is care of B. F.----\"\n\nI didn't hear the rest of the name because I hung up the receiver.\n\nAfter that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby--one gentleman to whom I\ntelephoned implied that he had got what he deserved. However, that was\nmy fault, for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at\nGatsby on the courage of Gatsby's liquor and I should have known\nbetter than to call him.\n\nThe morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer\nWolfsheim; I couldn't seem to reach him any other way. The door that I\npushed open on the advice of an elevator boy was marked \"The Swastika\nHolding Company\" and at first there didn't seem to be any one inside.\nBut when I'd shouted \"Hello\" several times in vain an argument broke\nout behind a partition and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an\ninterior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes.\n\n\"Nobody's in,\" she said. \"Mr. Wolfsheim's gone to Chicago.\"\n\nThe first part of this was obviously untrue for someone had begun to\nwhistle \"The Rosary,\" tunelessly, inside.\n\n\"Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.\"\n\n\"I can't get him back from Chicago, can I?\"\n\nAt this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfsheim's called \"Stella!\"\nfrom the other side of the door.\n\n\"Leave your name on the desk,\" she said quickly. \"I'll give it to him\nwhen he gets back.\"\n\n\"But I know he's there.\"\n\nShe took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up\nand down her hips.\n\n\"You young men think you can force your way in here any time,\" she\nscolded. \"We're getting sickantired of it. When I say he's in Chicago,\nhe's in ChiCAgo.\"\n\nI mentioned Gatsby.\n\n\"Oh--h!\" She looked at me over again. \"Will you just--what was your name?\"\n\nShe vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfsheim stood solemnly in the doorway,\nholding out both hands. He drew me into his office, remarking in a\nreverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered me\na cigar.\n\n\"My memory goes back to when I first met him,\" he said. \"A young\nmajor just out of the army and covered over with medals he got\nin the war. He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform\nbecause he couldn't buy some regular clothes. First time I saw him was\nwhen he come into Winebrenner's poolroom at Forty-third Street and\nasked for a job. He hadn't eat anything for a couple of days. 'Come on\nhave some lunch with me,' I sid. He ate more than four dollars' worth of\nfood in half an hour.\"\n\n\"Did you start him in business?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Start him! I made him.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right\naway he was a fine appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told\nme he was an Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join up\nin the American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he\ndid some work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like\nthat in everything--\" He held up two bulbous fingers \"--always\ntogether.\"\n\nI wondered if this partnership had included the World's Series transaction\nin 1919.\n\n\"Now he's dead,\" I said after a moment. \"You were his closest friend,\nso I know you'll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.\"\n\n\"I'd like to come.\"\n\n\"Well, come then.\"\n\nThe hair in his nostrils quivered slightly and as he shook his head his\neyes filled with tears.\n\n\"I can't do it--I can't get mixed up in it,\" he said.\n\n\"There's nothing to get mixed up in. It's all over now.\"\n\n\"When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way.\nI keep out. When I was a young man it was different--if a friend of mine\ndied, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You may think that's\nsentimental but I mean it--to the bitter end.\"\n\nI saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come,\nso I stood up.\n\n\"Are you a college man?\" he inquired suddenly.\n\nFor a moment I thought he was going to suggest a \"gonnegtion\" but he\nonly nodded and shook my hand.\n\n\"Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not\nafter he is dead,\" he suggested. \"After that my own rule is to let\neverything alone.\"\n\nWhen I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West Egg\nin a drizzle. After changing my clothes I went next door and found\nMr. Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall. His pride in his\nson and in his son's possessions was continually increasing and now he\nhad something to show me.\n\n\"Jimmy sent me this picture.\" He took out his wallet with trembling\nfingers. \"Look there.\"\n\nIt was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirty with\nmany hands. He pointed out every detail to me eagerly. \"Look there!\" and\nthen sought admiration from my eyes. He had shown it so often that I think\nit was more real to him now than the house itself.\n\n\"Jimmy sent it to me. I think it's a very pretty picture. It shows up\nwell.\"\n\n\"Very well. Had you seen him lately?\"\n\n\"He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in\nnow. Of course we was broke up when he run off from home but I see now\nthere was a reason for it. He knew he had a big future in front of him.\nAnd ever since he made a success he was very generous with me.\"\n\nHe seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another minute,\nlingeringly, before my eyes. Then he returned the wallet and pulled from\nhis pocket a ragged old copy of a book called \"Hopalong Cassidy.\"\n\n\"Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows\nyou.\"\n\nHe opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see.\nOn the last fly-leaf was printed the word SCHEDULE, and the date\nSeptember 12th, 1906. And underneath:\n\n\nRise from bed . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  6.00       A.M.\nDumbbell exercise and wall-scaling . . . . . . 6.15-6.30   \"\nStudy electricity, etc . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.15-8.15   \"\nWork . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8.30-4.30  P.M.\nBaseball and sports . . . . . . . . . . . . .  4.30-5.00   \"\nPractice elocution, poise and how to attain it 5.00-6.00   \"\nStudy needed inventions . . . . . . . . . . .  7.00-9.00   \"\n\n                GENERAL RESOLVES\n\nNo wasting time at Shafters or [a name, indecipherable]\nNo more smokeing or chewing\nBath every other day\nRead one improving book or magazine per week\nSave $5.00 [crossed out] $3.00 per week\nBe better to parents\n\n\n\"I come across this book by accident,\" said the old man. \"It just shows\nyou, don't it?\"\n\n\"It just shows you.\"\n\n\"Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this or\nsomething. Do you notice what he's got about improving his mind? He was\nalways great for that. He told me I et like a hog once and I beat him\nfor it.\"\n\nHe was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then\nlooking eagerly at me. I think he rather expected me to copy down the\nlist for my own use.\n\nA little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing and\nI began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars. So did\nGatsby's father. And as the time passed and the servants came in and\nstood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously and he\nspoke of the rain in a worried uncertain way. The minister glanced\nseveral times at his watch so I took him aside and asked him to wait\nfor half an hour. But it wasn't any use. Nobody came.\n\n\nAbout five o'clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery\nand stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate--first a motor hearse,\nhorribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and I in the\nlimousine, and, a little later, four or five servants and the postman\nfrom West Egg in Gatsby's station wagon, all wet to the skin. As we\nstarted through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then\nthe sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. I looked\naround. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found\nmarvelling over Gatsby's books in the library one night three months\nbefore.\n\nI'd never seen him since then. I don't know how he knew about the\nfuneral or even his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses and\nhe took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled\nfrom Gatsby's grave.\n\nI tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment but he was already too\nfar away and I could only remember, without resentment, that Daisy\nhadn't sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur\n\"Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,\" and then the owl-eyed\nman said \"Amen to that,\" in a brave voice.\n\nWe straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-Eyes spoke\nto me by the gate.\n\n\"I couldn't get to the house,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Neither could anybody else.\"\n\n\"Go on!\" He started. \"Why, my God! they used to go there by the\nhundreds.\"\n\nHe took off his glasses and wiped them again outside and in.\n\n\"The poor son-of-a-bitch,\" he said.\n\n\nOne of my most vivid memories is of coming back west from prep school\nand later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than\nChicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o'clock of a\nDecember evening with a few Chicago friends already caught up into\ntheir own holiday gayeties to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember\nthe fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This or That's and\nthe chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as\nwe caught sight of old acquaintances and the matchings of invitations:\n\"Are you going to the Ordways'? the Herseys'? the Schultzes'?\"\nand the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands.\nAnd last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul\nRailroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside\nthe gate.\n\nWhen we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow,\nbegan to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the\ndim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace\ncame suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked\nback from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our\nidentity with this country for one strange hour before we melted\nindistinguishably into it again.\n\nThat's my middle west--not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede\ntowns but the thrilling, returning trains of my youth and the street\nlamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly\nwreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a\nlittle solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent\nfrom growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are\nstill called through decades by a family's name. I see now that this\nhas been a story of the West, after all--Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and\nJordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some\ndeficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.\n\nEven when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware\nof its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the\nOhio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the\nchildren and the very old--even then it had always for me a quality of\ndistortion. West Egg especially still figures in my more fantastic\ndreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at\nonce conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging\nsky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress\nsuits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a\ndrunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over\nthe side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a\nhouse--the wrong house. But no one knows the woman's name, and no one\ncares.\n\nAfter Gatsby's death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted\nbeyond my eyes' power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle\nleaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the\nline I decided to come back home.\n\nThere was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant\nthing that perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted to\nleave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent\nsea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and\naround what had happened to us together and what had happened\nafterward to me, and she lay perfectly still listening in a big\nchair.\n\nShe was dressed to play golf and I remember thinking she looked like a\ngood illustration, her chin raised a little, jauntily, her hair the\ncolor of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless\nglove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without comment that\nshe was engaged to another man. I doubted that though there were\nseveral she could have married at a nod of her head but I pretended to\nbe surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn't making a\nmistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say\ngoodbye.\n\n\"Nevertheless you did throw me over,\" said Jordan suddenly. \"You threw me\nover on the telephone. I don't give a damn about you now but it was a\nnew experience for me and I felt a little dizzy for a while.\"\n\nWe shook hands.\n\n\"Oh, and do you remember--\" she added, \"----a conversation we had once\nabout driving a car?\"\n\n\"Why--not exactly.\"\n\n\"You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver?\nWell, I met another bad driver, didn't I? I mean it was careless of me\nto make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest,\nstraightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.\"\n\n\"I'm thirty,\" I said. \"I'm five years too old to lie to myself and call\nit honor.\"\n\nShe didn't answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously\nsorry, I turned away.\n\n\nOne afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead\nof me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a\nlittle from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving\nsharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as I\nslowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into\nthe windows of a jewelry store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back\nholding out his hand.\n\n\"What's the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?\"\n\n\"Yes. You know what I think of you.\"\n\n\"You're crazy, Nick,\" he said quickly. \"Crazy as hell. I don't know\nwhat's the matter with you.\"\n\n\"Tom,\" I inquired, \"what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?\"\n\nHe stared at me without a word and I knew I had guessed right about\nthose missing hours. I started to turn away but he took a step after me\nand grabbed my arm.\n\n\"I told him the truth,\" he said. \"He came to the door while we were\ngetting ready to leave and when I sent down word that we weren't in he\ntried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if I\nhadn't told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his\npocket every minute he was in the house----\" He broke off defiantly.\n\"What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw\ndust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy's but he was a tough\none. He ran over Myrtle like you'd run over a dog and never even stopped\nhis car.\"\n\nThere was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact\nthat it wasn't true.\n\n\"And if you think I didn't have my share of suffering--look here, when I\nwent to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting\nthere on the sideboard I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it\nwas awful----\"\n\nI couldn't forgive him or like him but I saw that what he had done was,\nto him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused.\nThey were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and\ncreatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast\ncarelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other\npeople clean up the mess they had made. . . .\n\nI shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as\nthough I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewelry store to\nbuy a pearl necklace--or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons--rid of my\nprovincial squeamishness forever.\n\n\nGatsby's house was still empty when I left--the grass on his lawn had\ngrown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village never\ntook a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and\npointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to\nEast Egg the night of the accident and perhaps he had made a story\nabout it all his own. I didn't want to hear it and I avoided him when I\ngot off the train.\n\nI spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling\nparties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the\nmusic and the laughter faint and incessant from his garden and the\ncars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a material car\nthere and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I didn't\ninvestigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the\nends of the earth and didn't know that the party was over.\n\nOn the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer,\nI went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once\nmore. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a\npiece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight and I erased it,\ndrawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the\nbeach and sprawled out on the sand.\n\nMost of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any\nlights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound.\nAnd as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away\nuntil gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered\nonce for Dutch sailors' eyes--a fresh, green breast of the new world.\nIts vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby's house, had\nonce pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams;\nfor a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the\npresence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation\nhe neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in\nhistory with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.\n\nAnd as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of\nGatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of\nDaisy's dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must\nhave seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not\nknow that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity\nbeyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under\nthe night.\n\nGatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by\nyear recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow\nwe will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine\nmorning----\n\nSo we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into\nthe past.\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nProject Gutenberg Australia",

In consequence I'm inclined to reserve all judgments,\na habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also\nmade me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind\nis quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it\nappears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I\nwas unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the\nsecret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were\nunsought--frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile\nlevity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate\nrevelation was quivering on the horizon--for the intimate revelations\nof young men or at least the terms in which they express them are\nusually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving\njudgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of\nmissing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested,\nand I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is\nparcelled out unequally at birth.\n\nAnd, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission\nthat it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet\nmarshes but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on.\nWhen I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the\nworld to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I\nwanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the\nhuman heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was\nexempt from my reaction--Gatsby who represented everything for which I\nhave an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of\nsuccessful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some\nheightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related\nto one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten\nthousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that\nflabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the\n\"creative temperament\"--it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic\nreadiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it\nis not likely I shall ever find again. No--Gatsby turned out all right\nat the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the\nwake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the\nabortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.\n\n\nMy family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle-western\ncity for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan and we\nhave a tradition that we're descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the\nactual founder of my line was my grandfather's brother who came here in\nfifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War and started the wholesale\nhardware business that my father carries on today.\n\nI never saw this great-uncle but I'm supposed to look like him--with\nspecial reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in\nFather's office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a\ncentury after my father, and a little later I participated in that\ndelayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the\ncounter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being\nthe warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like the\nragged edge of the universe--so I decided to go east and learn the bond\nbusiness. Everybody I knew was in the bond business so I supposed it\ncould support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it\nover as if they were choosing a prep-school for me and finally said,\n\"Why--ye-es\" with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance\nme for a year and after various delays I came east, permanently, I\nthought, in the spring of twenty-two.\n\nThe practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was a warm\nseason and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees,\nso when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house\ntogether in a commuting town it sounded like a great idea. He found\nthe house, a weather beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but\nat the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went out\nto the country alone. I had a dog, at least I had him for a few days\nuntil he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman who made my bed\nand cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the\nelectric stove.\n\nIt was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently\narrived than I, stopped me on the road.\n\n\"How do you get to West Egg village?\" he asked helplessly.\n\nI told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a\npathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the\nfreedom of the neighborhood.\n\nAnd so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the\ntrees--just as things grow in fast movies--I had that familiar\nconviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.\n\nThere was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health to be\npulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen\nvolumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood\non my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to\nunfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas\nknew. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides.\nI was rather literary in college--one year I wrote a series of very\nsolemn and obvious editorials for the \"Yale News\"--and now I was going\nto bring back all such things into my life and become again that most\nlimited of all specialists, the \"well-rounded man.\" This isn't just an\nepigram--life is much more successfully looked at from a single window,\nafter all.\n\nIt was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of\nthe strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender\nriotous island which extends itself due east of New York and where\nthere are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of\nland. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in\ncontour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most\ndomesticated body of salt water in the Western Hemisphere, the great\nwet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals--like the\negg in the Columbus story they are both crushed flat at the contact\nend--but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual\nconfusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more\narresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except\nshape and size.\n\nI lived at West Egg, the--well, the less fashionable of the two, though\nthis is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little\nsinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the\negg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge\nplaces that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on\nmy right was a colossal affair by any standard--it was a factual\nimitation of some H\u00f4tel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side,\nspanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool\nand more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby's mansion.\nOr rather, as I didn't know Mr. Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by\na gentleman of that name. My own house was an eye-sore, but it was a\nsmall eye-sore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the\nwater, a partial view of my neighbor's lawn, and the consoling\nproximity of millionaires--all for eighty dollars a month.\n\nAcross the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg\nglittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins\non the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom\nBuchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed and I'd known Tom\nin college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in\nChicago.\n\nHer husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of\nthe most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven--a\nnational figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute\nlimited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of\nanti-climax. His family were enormously wealthy--even in college his\nfreedom with money was a matter for reproach--but now he'd left Chicago\nand come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for\ninstance he'd brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest.\nIt was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy\nenough to do that.\n\nWhy they came east I don't know. They had spent a year in France, for no\nparticular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever\npeople played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move,\nsaid Daisy over the telephone, but I didn't believe it--I had no sight\ninto Daisy's heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking\na little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable\nfootball game.\n\nAnd so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East\nEgg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was\neven more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red and white Georgian\nColonial mansion overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach\nand ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over\nsun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens--finally when it reached\nthe house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the\nmomentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows,\nglowing now with reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy\nafternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his\nlegs apart on the front porch.\n\nHe had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy, straw haired\nman of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner.\nTwo shining, arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and\ngave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not\neven the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous\npower of that body--he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he\nstrained the top lacing and you could see a great pack of muscle\nshifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body\ncapable of enormous leverage--a cruel body.\n\nHis speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of\nfractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in\nit, even toward people he liked--and there were men at New Haven who had\nhated his guts.\n\n\"Now, don't think my opinion on these matters is final,\" he seemed to\nsay, \"just because I'm stronger and more of a man than you are.\" We\nwere in the same Senior Society, and while we were never intimate I\nalways had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like\nhim with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.\n\nWe talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.\n\n\"I've got a nice place here,\" he said, his eyes flashing about\nrestlessly.\n\nTurning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat hand along the\nfront vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half\nacre of deep pungent roses and a snub-nosed motor boat that bumped\nthe tide off shore.\n\n\"It belonged to Demaine the oil man.\" He turned me around again,\npolitely and abruptly. \"We'll go inside.\"\n\nWe walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space,\nfragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end.\nThe windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass\noutside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze\nblew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other\nlike pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of\nthe ceiling--and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a\nshadow on it as wind does on the sea.\n\nThe only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch\non which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored\nballoon. They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and\nfluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight\naround the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the\nwhip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall.\nThen there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught\nwind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two\nyoung women ballooned slowly to the floor.\n\nThe younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length\nat her end of the divan, completely motionless and with her chin raised\na little as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely\nto fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of\nit--indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having\ndisturbed her by coming in.\n\nThe other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise--she leaned slightly\nforward with a conscientious expression--then she laughed, an absurd,\ncharming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the\nroom.\n\n\"I'm p-paralyzed with happiness.\"\n\nShe laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand\nfor a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one\nin the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had.\nShe hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker.\n(I've heard it said that Daisy's murmur was only to make people\nlean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)\n\nAt any rate Miss Baker's lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost\nimperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back again--the object\nshe was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something\nof a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any\nexhibition of complete self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.\n\nI looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low,\nthrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and\ndown as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be\nplayed again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,\nbright eyes and a bright passionate mouth--but there was an excitement\nin her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget:\na singing compulsion, a whispered \"Listen,\" a promise that she had done\ngay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,\nexciting things hovering in the next hour.\n\nI told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way east\nand how a dozen people had sent their love through me.\n\n\"Do they miss me?\" she cried ecstatically.\n\n\"The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel\npainted black as a mourning wreath and there's a persistent wail all\nnight along the North Shore.\"\n\n\"How gorgeous! Let's go back, Tom. Tomorrow!\" Then she added\nirrelevantly, \"You ought to see the baby.\"\n\n\"I'd like to.\"\n\n\"She's asleep. She's two years old. Haven't you ever seen her?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Well, you ought to see her. She's----\"\n\nTom Buchanan who had been hovering restlessly about the room stopped\nand rested his hand on my shoulder.\n\n\"What you doing, Nick?\"\n\n\"I'm a bond man.\"\n\n\"Who with?\"\n\nI told him.\n\n\"Never heard of them,\" he remarked decisively.\n\nThis annoyed me.\n\n\"You will,\" I answered shortly. \"You will if you stay in the East.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll stay in the East, don't you worry,\" he said, glancing at\nDaisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more.\n\"I'd be a God Damned fool to live anywhere else.\"\n\nAt this point Miss Baker said \"Absolutely!\" with such suddenness that I\nstarted--it was the first word she uttered since I came into the room.\nEvidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and\nwith a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.\n\n\"I'm stiff,\" she complained, \"I've been lying on that sofa for as long\nas I can remember.\"\n\n\"Don't look at me,\" Daisy retorted. \"I've been trying to get you to New\nYork all afternoon.\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the\npantry, \"I'm absolutely in training.\"\n\nHer host looked at her incredulously.\n\n\"You are!\" He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of\na glass. \"How you ever get anything done is beyond me.\"\n\nI looked at Miss Baker wondering what it was she \"got done.\" I enjoyed\nlooking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect\ncarriage which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the\nshoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at\nme with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming discontented\nface. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her,\nsomewhere before.\n\n\"You live in West Egg,\" she remarked contemptuously. \"I know somebody\nthere.\"\n\n\"I don't know a single----\"\n\n\"You must know Gatsby.\"\n\n\"Gatsby?\" demanded Daisy. \"What Gatsby?\"\n\nBefore I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced;\nwedging his tense arm imperatively under mine Tom Buchanan compelled\nme from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.\n\nSlenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips the two\nyoung women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch open toward the\nsunset where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished\nwind.\n\n\"Why CANDLES?\" objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her\nfingers. \"In two weeks it'll be the longest day in the year.\"\nShe looked at us all radiantly. \"Do you always watch for the longest day\nof the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the\nyear and then miss it.\"\n\n\"We ought to plan something,\" yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the\ntable as if she were getting into bed.\n\n\"All right,\" said Daisy. \"What'll we plan?\" She turned to me helplessly.\n\"What do people plan?\"\n\nBefore I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her\nlittle finger.\n\n\"Look!\" she complained. \"I hurt it.\"\n\nWe all looked--the knuckle was black and blue.\n\n\"You did it, Tom,\" she said accusingly. \"I know you didn't mean to\nbut you DID do it. That's what I get for marrying a brute of a man,\na great big hulking physical specimen of a----\"\n\n\"I hate that word hulking,\" objected Tom crossly, \"even in kidding.\"\n\n\"Hulking,\" insisted Daisy.\n\nSometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a\nbantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool\nas their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all\ndesire. They were here--and they accepted Tom and me, making only a\npolite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew\nthat presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too\nwould be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the\nWest where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its\nclose in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer\nnervous dread of the moment itself.\n\n\"You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,\" I confessed on my second glass\nof corky but rather impressive claret. \"Can't you talk about crops or\nsomething?\"\n\nI meant nothing in particular by this remark but it was taken up in an\nunexpected way.\n\n\"Civilization's going to pieces,\" broke out Tom violently.\n\"I've gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read\n'The Rise of the Coloured Empires' by this man Goddard?\"\n\n\"Why, no,\" I answered, rather surprised by his tone.\n\n\"Well, it's a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if\nwe don't look out the white race will be--will be utterly submerged.\nIt's all scientific stuff; it's been proved.\"\n\n\"Tom's getting very profound,\" said Daisy with an expression of\nunthoughtful sadness. \"He reads deep books with long words in them.\nWhat was that word we----\"\n\n\"Well, these books are all scientific,\" insisted Tom, glancing at her\nimpatiently. \"This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up to us\nwho are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have\ncontrol of things.\"\n\n\"We've got to beat them down,\" whispered Daisy, winking ferociously\ntoward the fervent sun.\n\n\"You ought to live in California--\" began Miss Baker but Tom\ninterrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.\n\n\"This idea is that we're Nordics. I am, and you are and you are\nand----\" After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a\nslight nod and she winked at me again. \"--and we've produced all the\nthings that go to make civilization--oh, science and art and all that.\nDo you see?\"\n\nThere was something pathetic in his concentration as if his complacency,\nmore acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. When, almost\nimmediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy\nseized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.\n\n\"I'll tell you a family secret,\" she whispered enthusiastically. \"It's\nabout the butler's nose. Do you want to hear about the butler's nose?\"\n\n\"That's why I came over tonight.\"\n\n\"Well, he wasn't always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for\nsome people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people.\nHe had to polish it from morning till night until finally it began to\naffect his nose----\"\n\n\"Things went from bad to worse,\" suggested Miss Baker.\n\n\"Yes. Things went from bad to worse until finally he had to give up\nhis position.\"\n\nFor a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon\nher glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as\nI listened--then the glow faded, each light deserting her with\nlingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.\n\nThe butler came back and murmured something close to Tom's ear\nwhereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair and without a word went\ninside. As if his absence quickened something within her Daisy leaned\nforward again, her voice glowing and singing.\n\n\"I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a--of a rose, an\nabsolute rose. Doesn't he?\" She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation.\n\"An absolute rose?\"\n\nThis was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only\nextemporizing but a stirring warmth flowed from her as if her\nheart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those\nbreathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the\ntable and excused herself and went into the house.\n\nMiss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of\nmeaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said \"Sh!\" in\na warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room\nbeyond and Miss Baker leaned forward, unashamed, trying to hear. The\nmurmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted\nexcitedly, and then ceased altogether.\n\n\"This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor----\" I said.\n\n\"Don't talk. I want to hear what happens.\"\n\n\"Is something happening?\" I inquired innocently.\n\n\"You mean to say you don't know?\" said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.\n\"I thought everybody knew.\"\n\n\"I don't.\"\n\n\"Why----\" she said hesitantly, \"Tom's got some woman in New York.\"\n\n\"Got some woman?\" I repeated blankly.\n\nMiss Baker nodded.\n\n\"She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner-time. Don't\nyou think?\"\n\nAlmost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of\na dress and the crunch of leather boots and Tom and Daisy were back\nat the table.\n\n\"It couldn't be helped!\" cried Daisy with tense gayety.\n\nShe sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me and\ncontinued: \"I looked outdoors for a minute and it's very romantic\noutdoors. There's a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale\ncome over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He's singing away----\" her\nvoice sang \"----It's romantic, isn't it, Tom?\"\n\n\"Very romantic,\" he said, and then miserably to me: \"If it's light enough\nafter dinner I want to take you down to the stables.\"\n\nThe telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her\nhead decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all\nsubjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the\nlast five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again,\npointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every\none and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn't guess what Daisy and Tom\nwere thinking but I doubt if even Miss Baker who seemed to have\nmastered a certain hardy skepticism was able utterly to put this fifth\nguest's shrill metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament\nthe situation might have seemed intriguing--my own instinct was to\ntelephone immediately for the police.\n\nThe horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss\nBaker, with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into\nthe library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while\ntrying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf I followed\nDaisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In\nits deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.\n\nDaisy took her face in her hands, as if feeling its lovely shape, and\nher eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent\nemotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some\nsedative questions about her little girl.\n\n\"We don't know each other very well, Nick,\" she said suddenly.\n\"Even if we are cousins. You didn't come to my wedding.\"\n\n\"I wasn't back from the war.\"\n\n\"That's true.\" She hesitated. \"Well, I've had a very bad time, Nick,\nand I'm pretty cynical about everything.\"\n\nEvidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn't say any more,\nand after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her\ndaughter.\n\n\"I suppose she talks, and--eats, and everything.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\" She looked at me absently. \"Listen, Nick; let me tell you what\nI said when she was born. Would you like to hear?\"\n\n\"Very much.\"\n\n\"It'll show you how I've gotten to feel about--things. Well, she was less\nthan an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether\nwith an utterly abandoned feeling and asked the nurse right away if it\nwas a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head\naway and wept. 'All right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope\nshe'll be a fool--that's the best thing a girl can be in this world,\na beautiful little fool.\"\n\n\"You see I think everything's terrible anyhow,\" she went on in a\nconvinced way. \"Everybody thinks so--the most advanced people. And I KNOW.\nI've been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.\"\nHer eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom's, and she\nlaughed with thrilling scorn. \"Sophisticated--God, I'm sophisticated!\"\n\nThe instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention,\nmy belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said.\nIt made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick\nof some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited,\nand sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk\non her lovely face as if she had asserted her membership in a rather\ndistinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.\n\n\nInside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker\nsat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from\nthe \"Saturday Evening Post\"--the words, murmurous and\nuninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamp-light,\nbright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair,\nglinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender\nmuscles in her arms.\n\nWhen we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.\n\n\"To be continued,\" she said, tossing the magazine on the table, \"in our\nvery next issue.\"\n\nHer body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she\nstood up.\n\n\"Ten o'clock,\" she remarked, apparently finding the time on the\nceiling. \"Time for this good girl to go to bed.\"\n\n\"Jordan's going to play in the tournament tomorrow,\" explained Daisy,\n\"over at Westchester.\"\n\n\"Oh,--you're JORdan Baker.\"\n\nI knew now why her face was familiar--its pleasing contemptuous\nexpression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of\nthe sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I\nhad heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story,\nbut what it was I had forgotten long ago.\n\n\"Good night,\" she said softly. \"Wake me at eight, won't you.\"\n\n\"If you'll get up.\"\n\n\"I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.\"\n\n\"Of course you will,\" confirmed Daisy. \"In fact I think I'll arrange\na marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I'll sort of--oh--fling you\ntogether. You know--lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push\nyou out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing----\"\n\n\"Good night,\" called Miss Baker from the stairs. \"I haven't heard a word.\"\n\n\"She's a nice girl,\" said Tom after a moment. \"They oughtn't to let her\nrun around the country this way.\"\n\n\"Who oughtn't to?\" inquired Daisy coldly.\n\n\"Her family.\"\n\n\"Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick's\ngoing to look after her, aren't you, Nick? She's going to spend lots of\nweek-ends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very\ngood for her.\"\n\nDaisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.\n\n\"Is she from New York?\" I asked quickly.\n\n\"From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our\nbeautiful white----\"\n\n\"Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?\"\ndemanded Tom suddenly.\n\n\"Did I?\" She looked at me. \"I can't seem to remember, but I think\nwe talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I'm sure we did. It sort of\ncrept up on us and first thing you know----\"\n\n\"Don't believe everything you hear, Nick,\" he advised me.\n\nI said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later\nI got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood side by\nside in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor Daisy\nperemptorily called \"Wait!\n\n\"I forgot to ask you something, and it's important. We heard you were\nengaged to a girl out West.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" corroborated Tom kindly. \"We heard that you were\nengaged.\"\n\n\"It's libel. I'm too poor.\"\n\n\"But we heard it,\" insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in\na flower-like way. \"We heard it from three people so it must be true.\"\n\nOf course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn't even vaguely\nengaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the\nreasons I had come east. You can't stop going with an old friend on\naccount of rumors and on the other hand I had no intention of being\nrumored into marriage.\n\nTheir interest rather touched me and made them less remotely\nrich--nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove\naway. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of\nthe house, child in arms--but apparently there were no such intentions\nin her head. As for Tom, the fact that he \"had some woman in New York\"\nwas really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book.\nSomething was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his\nsturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.\n\nAlready it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside\ngarages, where new red gas-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I\nreached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for\na while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown\noff, leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees and\na persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the\nfrogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the\nmoonlight and turning my head to watch it I saw that I was not\nalone--fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my\nneighbor's mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets\nregarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely\nmovements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested\nthat it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was\nhis of our local heavens.\n\nI decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and\nthat would do for an introduction. But I didn't call to him for he gave\na sudden intimation that he was content to be alone--he stretched out his\narms toward the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him\nI could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward--and\ndistinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away,\nthat might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby\nhe had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n\n\nAbout half way between West Egg and New York the motor-road hastily\njoins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to\nshrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of\nashes--a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and\nhills and grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and\nchimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcendent effort, of\nmen who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.\nOccasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives\nout a ghastly creak and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey\nmen swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud\nwhich screens their obscure operations from your sight.\n\nBut above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift\nendlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T.\nJ. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and\ngigantic--their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face but,\ninstead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a\nnonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to\nfatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself\ninto eternal blindness or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes,\ndimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain, brood on over\nthe solemn dumping ground.\n\nThe valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and\nwhen the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on\nwaiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an\nhour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute and it was\nbecause of this that I first met Tom Buchanan's mistress.\n\nThe fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. His\nacquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular\nrestaurants with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about,\nchatting with whomsoever he knew. Though I was curious to see her I\nhad no desire to meet her--but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on\nthe train one afternoon and when we stopped by the ashheaps he jumped\nto his feet and taking hold of my elbow literally forced me from the\ncar.\n\n\"We're getting off!\" he insisted. \"I want you to meet my girl.\"\n\nI think he'd tanked up a good deal at luncheon and his determination to\nhave my company bordered on violence. The supercilious assumption was that\non Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.\n\nI followed him over a low white-washed railroad fence and we walked\nback a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg's persistent\nstare. The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick\nsitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street\nministering to it and contiguous to absolutely nothing. One of the\nthree shops it contained was for rent and another was an all-night\nrestaurant approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a\ngarage--Repairs. GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars Bought and Sold--and I followed\nTom inside.\n\nThe interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the\ndust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had\noccurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind and that\nsumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead when the\nproprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands\non a piece of waste. He was a blonde, spiritless man, anaemic, and\nfaintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his\nlight blue eyes.\n\n\"Hello, Wilson, old man,\" said Tom, slapping him jovially on the\nshoulder. \"How's business?\"\n\n\"I can't complain,\" answered Wilson unconvincingly. \"When are you going\nto sell me that car?\"\n\n\"Next week; I've got my man working on it now.\"\n\n\"Works pretty slow, don't he?\"\n\n\"No, he doesn't,\" said Tom coldly. \"And if you feel that way about it,\nmaybe I'd better sell it somewhere else after all.\"\n\n\"I don't mean that,\" explained Wilson quickly. \"I just meant----\"\n\nHis voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage. Then\nI heard footsteps on a stairs and in a moment the thickish figure of a\nwoman blocked out the light from the office door. She was in the middle\nthirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously\nas some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue\ncrepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty but there was an\nimmediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body\nwere continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and walking through her\nhusband as if he were a ghost shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in\nthe eye. Then she wet her lips and without turning around spoke to her\nhusband in a soft, coarse voice:\n\n\"Get some chairs, why don't you, so somebody can sit down.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" agreed Wilson hurriedly and went toward the little office,\nmingling immediately with the cement color of the walls. A white ashen\ndust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in\nthe vicinity--except his wife, who moved close to Tom.\n\n\"I want to see you,\" said Tom intently. \"Get on the next train.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\n\"I'll meet you by the news-stand on the lower level.\"\n\nShe nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson\nemerged with two chairs from his office door.\n\nWe waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days before\nthe Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting\ntorpedoes in a row along the railroad track.\n\n\"Terrible place, isn't it,\" said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor\nEckleburg.\n\n\"Awful.\"\n\n\"It does her good to get away.\"\n\n\"Doesn't her husband object?\"\n\n\"Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He's so dumb\nhe doesn't know he's alive.\"\n\nSo Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York--or not\nquite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom\ndeferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be\non the train.\n\nShe had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin which stretched\ntight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in\nNew York. At the news-stand she bought a copy of \"Town Tattle\" and a\nmoving-picture magazine and, in the station drug store, some cold cream\nand a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive\nshe let four taxi cabs drive away before she selected a new one,\nlavender-colored with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the\nmass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she\nturned sharply from the window and leaning forward tapped on the\nfront glass.\n\n\"I want to get one of those dogs,\" she said earnestly. \"I want to get one\nfor the apartment. They're nice to have--a dog.\"\n\nWe backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John\nD. Rockefeller. In a basket, swung from his neck, cowered a dozen very\nrecent puppies of an indeterminate breed.\n\n\"What kind are they?\" asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly as he came to the\ntaxi-window.\n\n\"All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?\"\n\n\"I'd like to get one of those police dogs; I don't suppose you got that\nkind?\"\n\nThe man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew\none up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.\n\n\"That's no police dog,\" said Tom.\n\n\"No, it's not exactly a polICE dog,\" said the man with disappointment\nin his voice. \"It's more of an airedale.\" He passed his hand over the\nbrown wash-rag of a back. \"Look at that coat. Some coat. That's a dog\nthat'll never bother you with catching cold.\"\n\n\"I think it's cute,\" said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. \"How much is it?\"\n\n\"That dog?\" He looked at it admiringly. \"That dog will cost you ten\ndollars.\"\n\nThe airedale--undoubtedly there was an airedale concerned in it somewhere\nthough its feet were startlingly white--changed hands and settled down\ninto Mrs. Wilson's lap, where she fondled the weather-proof coat with\nrapture.\n\n\"Is it a boy or a girl?\" she asked delicately.\n\n\"That dog? That dog's a boy.\"\n\n\"It's a bitch,\" said Tom decisively. \"Here's your money. Go and buy ten\nmore dogs with it.\"\n\nWe drove over to Fifth Avenue, so warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the\nsummer Sunday afternoon that I wouldn't have been surprised to see a great\nflock of white sheep turn the corner.\n\n\"Hold on,\" I said, \"I have to leave you here.\"\n\n\"No, you don't,\" interposed Tom quickly. \"Myrtle'll be hurt if you don't \ncome up to the apartment. Won't you,\nMyrtle?\"\n\n\"Come on,\" she urged. \"I'll telephone my sister Catherine. She's said to\nbe very beautiful by people who ought to know.\"\n\n\"Well, I'd like to, but----\"\n\nWe went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds.\nAt 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of\napartment houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the\nneighborhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases\nand went haughtily in.\n\n\"I'm going to have the McKees come up,\" she announced as we rose in the\nelevator. \"And of course I got to call up my sister, too.\"\n\nThe apartment was on the top floor--a small living room, a small\ndining room, a small bedroom and a bath. The living room was crowded to\nthe doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it\nso that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of\nladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was\nan over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred\nrock. Looked at from a distance however the hen resolved itself\ninto a bonnet and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down\ninto the room. Several old copies of \"Town Tattle \"lay on the table\ntogether with a copy of \"Simon Called Peter\" and some of the small\nscandal magazines of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with\nthe dog. A reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and\nsome milk to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large\nhard dog biscuits--one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer\nof milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whiskey\nfrom a locked bureau door.\n\nI have been drunk just twice in my life and the second time was that\nafternoon so everything that happened has a dim hazy cast over it\nalthough until after eight o'clock the apartment was full of cheerful\nsun. Sitting on Tom's lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the\ntelephone; then there were no cigarettes and I went out to buy some at\nthe drug store on the corner. When I came back they had disappeared so\nI sat down discreetly in the living room and read a chapter of \"Simon\nCalled Peter\"--either it was terrible stuff or the whiskey distorted\nthings because it didn't make any sense to me.\n\nJust as Tom and Myrtle--after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called\neach other by our first names--reappeared, company commenced to arrive\nat the apartment door.\n\nThe sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty\nwith a solid sticky bob of red hair and a complexion powdered milky\nwhite. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more\nrakish angle but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the\nold alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about\nthere was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets\njingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary\nhaste and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered\nif she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated\nmy question aloud and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel.\n\nMr. McKee was a pale feminine man from the flat below. He had just\nshaved for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone and he\nwas most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He\ninformed me that he was in the \"artistic game\" and I gathered later\nthat he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs.\nWilson's mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His wife\nwas shrill, languid, handsome and horrible. She told me with pride\nthat her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven times\nsince they had been married.\n\nMrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before and was now\nattired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream colored chiffon, which\ngave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room.\nWith the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a\nchange. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage\nwas converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her\nassertions became more violently affected moment by moment and as she\nexpanded the room grew smaller around her until she seemed to be\nrevolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.\n\n\"My dear,\" she told her sister in a high mincing shout, \"most of these\nfellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I had a\nwoman up here last week to look at my feet and when she gave me the\nbill you'd of thought she had my appendicitus out.\"\n\n\"What was the name of the woman?\" asked Mrs. McKee.\n\n\"Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people's feet in their own\nhomes.\"\n\n\"I like your dress,\" remarked Mrs. McKee, \"I think it's adorable.\"\n\nMrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.\n\n\"It's just a crazy old thing,\" she said. \"I just slip it on sometimes when\nI don't care what I look like.\"\n\n\"But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,\" pursued\nMrs. McKee. \"If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could\nmake something of it.\"\n\nWe all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson who removed a strand of hair from\nover her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee\nregarded her intently with his head on one side and then moved his hand\nback and forth slowly in front of his face.\n\n\"I should change the light,\" he said after a moment. \"I'd like to bring\nout the modelling of the features. And I'd try to get hold of all the\nback hair.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't think of changing the light,\" cried Mrs. McKee. \"I think\nit's----\"\n\nHer husband said \"SH!\" and we all looked at the subject again whereupon\nTom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.\n\n\"You McKees have something to drink,\" he said. \"Get some more ice and\nmineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.\"\n\n\"I told that boy about the ice.\" Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair\nat the shiftlessness of the lower orders. \"These people! You have to keep\nafter them all the time.\"\n\nShe looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the\ndog, kissed it with ecstasy and swept into the kitchen, implying that\na dozen chefs awaited her orders there.\n\n\"I've done some nice things out on Long Island,\" asserted Mr. McKee.\n\nTom looked at him blankly.\n\n\"Two of them we have framed downstairs.\"\n\n\"Two what?\" demanded Tom.\n\n\"Two studies. One of them I call 'Montauk Point--the Gulls,' and the\nother I call 'Montauk Point--the Sea.' \"\n\nThe sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.\n\n\"Do you live down on Long Island, too?\" she inquired.\n\n\"I live at West Egg.\"\n\n\"Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named\nGatsby's. Do you know him?\"\n\n\"I live next door to him.\"\n\n\"Well, they say he's a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm's. That's\nwhere all his money comes from.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"I'm scared of him. I'd hate to have him get anything on me.\"\n\nThis absorbing information about my neighbor was interrupted by\nMrs. McKee's pointing suddenly at Catherine:\n\n\"Chester, I think you could do something with HER,\" she broke out,\nbut Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way and turned his attention\nto Tom.\n\n\"I'd like to do more work on Long Island if I could get the entry. All\nI ask is that they should give me a start.\"\n\n\"Ask Myrtle,\" said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as\nMrs. Wilson entered with a tray. \"She'll give you a letter of\nintroduction, won't you, Myrtle?\"\n\n\"Do what?\" she asked, startled.\n\n\"You'll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can\ndo some studies of him.\" His lips moved silently for a moment as he\ninvented. \" 'George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,' or something like\nthat.\"\n\n\nCatherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear: \"Neither of them\ncan stand the person they're married to.\"\n\n\"Can't they?\"\n\n\"Can't STAND them.\" She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. \"What I say is,\nwhy go on living with them if they can't stand them? If I was them I'd get\na divorce and get married to each other right away.\"\n\n\"Doesn't she like Wilson either?\"\n\nThe answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle who had overheard\nthe question and it was violent and obscene.\n\n\"You see?\" cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again.\n\"It's really his wife that's keeping them apart. She's a Catholic and\nthey don't believe in divorce.\"\n\nDaisy was not a Catholic and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness\nof the lie.\n\n\"When they do get married,\" continued Catherine, \"they're going west to\nlive for a while until it blows over.\"\n\n\"It'd be more discreet to go to Europe.\"\n\n\"Oh, do you like Europe?\" she exclaimed surprisingly. \"I just got back\nfrom Monte Carlo.\"\n\n\"Really.\"\n\n\"Just last year. I went over there with another girl.\"\n\n\"Stay long?\"\n\n\"No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way of Marseilles.\nWe had over twelve hundred dollars when we started but we got gypped\nout of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had an awful time\ngetting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town!\"\n\nThe late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue\nhoney of the Mediterranean--then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me\nback into the room.\n\n\"I almost made a mistake, too,\" she declared vigorously. \"I almost\nmarried a little kyke who'd been after me for years. I knew he was\nbelow me. Everybody kept saying to me: 'Lucille, that man's way below\nyou!' But if I hadn't met Chester, he'd of got me sure.\"\n\n\"Yes, but listen,\" said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down,\n\"at least you didn't marry him.\"\n\n\"I know I didn't.\"\n\n\"Well, I married him,\" said Myrtle, ambiguously. \"And that's the\ndifference between your case and mine.\"\n\n\"Why did you, Myrtle?\" demanded Catherine. \"Nobody forced you to.\"\n\nMyrtle considered.\n\n\"I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,\" she said finally.\n\"I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn't fit to lick\nmy shoe.\"\n\n\"You were crazy about him for a while,\" said Catherine.\n\n\"Crazy about him!\" cried Myrtle incredulously. \"Who said I was crazy about\nhim? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man\nthere.\"\n\nShe pointed suddenly at me, and every one looked at me accusingly.\nI tried to show by my expression that I had played no part in her past.\n\n\"The only CRAZY I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made a\nmistake. He borrowed somebody's best suit to get married in and never\neven told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he was out.\nShe looked around to see who was listening: \" 'Oh, is that your suit?' I \nsaid.\n'This is the first I ever heard about it.' But I gave it to him and then I \nlay down\nand cried to beat the band all afternoon.\"\n\n\"She really ought to get away from him,\" resumed Catherine to me.\n\"They've been living over that garage for eleven years. And Tom's the\nfirst sweetie she ever had.\"\n\nThe bottle of whiskey--a second one--was now in constant demand by all\npresent, excepting Catherine who \"felt just as good on nothing at all.\"\nTom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches,\nwhich were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted to get out and walk\neastward toward the park through the soft twilight but each time I tried\nto go I became entangled in some wild strident argument which pulled me\nback, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city our line of\nyellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the\ncasual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and\nwondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled\nby the inexhaustible variety of life.\n\nMyrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath\npoured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.\n\n\"It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the\nlast ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my\nsister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather\nshoes and I couldn't keep my eyes off him but every time he looked at\nme I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head.\nWhen we came into the station he was next to me and his white\nshirt-front pressed against my arm--and so I told him I'd have to call\na policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into\na taxi with him I didn't hardly know I wasn't getting into a subway\ntrain. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was 'You can't live\nforever, you can't live forever.' \"\n\nShe turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial\nlaughter.\n\n\"My dear,\" she cried, \"I'm going to give you this dress as soon as I'm\nthrough with it. I've got to get another one tomorrow. I'm going to\nmake a list of all the things I've got to get. A massage and a wave\nand a collar for the dog and one of those cute little ash-trays where\nyou touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother's\ngrave that'll last all summer. I got to write down a list so I won't\nforget all the things I got to do.\"\n\nIt was nine o'clock--almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch\nand found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists\nclenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out my\nhandkerchief I wiped from his cheek the remains of the spot of dried\nlather that had worried me all the afternoon.\n\nThe little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through\nthe smoke and from time to time groaning faintly. People disappeared,\nreappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other,\nsearched for each other, found each other a few feet away. Some time\ntoward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face\ndiscussing in impassioned voices whether Mrs. Wilson had any right to\nmention Daisy's name.\n\n\"Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!\" shouted Mrs. Wilson. \"I'll say it whenever I want\nto! Daisy! Dai----\"\n\nMaking a short deft movement Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his\nopen hand.\n\nThen there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women's\nvoices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of\npain. Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the door.\nWhen he had gone half way he turned around and stared at the scene--his\nwife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and\nthere among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and the\ndespairing figure on the couch bleeding fluently and trying to spread\na copy of \"Town Tattle\" over the tapestry scenes of Versailles.\nThen Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the door. Taking my hat from\nthe chandelier I followed.\n\n\"Come to lunch some day,\" he suggested, as we groaned down in the\nelevator.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Anywhere.\"\n\n\"Keep your hands off the lever,\" snapped the elevator boy.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. McKee with dignity, \"I didn't know I was\ntouching it.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I agreed, \"I'll be glad to.\"\n\n. . . I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the\nsheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.\n\n\"Beauty and the Beast . . . Loneliness . . . Old Grocery Horse . . .\nBrook'n Bridge . . . .\"\n\nThen I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the Pennsylvania\nStation, staring at the morning \"Tribune\" and waiting for the four\no'clock train.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n\n\nThere was music from my neighbor's house through the summer nights. In\nhis blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the\nwhisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the\nafternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft or\ntaking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats\nslit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of\nfoam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties\nto and from the city, between nine in the morning and long past\nmidnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to\nmeet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants including an extra\ngardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers\nand garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.\n\nEvery Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer\nin New York--every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back\ndoor in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the\nkitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an\nhour, if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler's\nthumb.\n\nAt least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several\nhundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas\ntree of Gatsby's enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with\nglistening hors-d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of\nharlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold.\nIn the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked\nwith gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of\nhis female guests were too young to know one from another.\n\nBy seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived--no thin five-piece affair\nbut a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and\ncornets and piccolos and low and high drums. The last swimmers have\ncome in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from\nNew York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and\nsalons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors and hair shorn in\nstrange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The\nbar is in full swing and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the\ngarden outside until the air is alive with chatter and laughter and\ncasual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and\nenthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names.\n\nThe lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and\nnow the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music and the opera of\nvoices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier, minute by minute,\nspilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups\nchange more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the\nsame breath--already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave\nhere and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp,\njoyous moment the center of a group and then excited with triumph\nglide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the\nconstantly changing light.\n\nSuddenly one of these gypsies in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out\nof the air, dumps it down for courage and moving her hands like\nFrisco dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; the\norchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her and there is a\nburst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda\nGray's understudy from the \"Follies.\" The party has begun.\n\nI believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby's house I was one of\nthe few guests who had actually been invited. People were not\ninvited--they went there. They got into automobiles which bore them out\nto Long Island and somehow they ended up at Gatsby's door. Once there\nthey were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby and after that they\nconducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with\namusement parks. Sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby\nat all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own\nticket of admission.\n\nI had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of robin's egg\nblue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly\nformal note from his employer--the honor would be entirely Gatsby's, it\nsaid, if I would attend his \"little party\" that night. He had\nseen me several times and had intended to call on me long before\nbut a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it--signed\nJay Gatsby in a majestic hand.\n\nDressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after\nseven and wandered around rather ill-at-ease among swirls and eddies\nof people I didn't know--though here and there was a face I had noticed\non the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number of young\nEnglishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry\nand all talking in low earnest voices to solid and prosperous\nAmericans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or\ninsurance or automobiles. They were, at least, agonizingly aware of the\neasy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few\nwords in the right key.\n\nAs soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host but the two or\nthree people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an\namazed way and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements\nthat I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table--the only place\nin the garden where a single man could linger without looking\npurposeless and alone.\n\nI was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when\nJordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble\nsteps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest\ndown into the garden.\n\nWelcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone\nbefore I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passers-by.\n\n\"Hello!\" I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturally\nloud across the garden.\n\n\"I thought you might be here,\" she responded absently as I came up.\n\"I remembered you lived next door to----\"\n\nShe held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she'd take care\nof me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses\nwho stopped at the foot of the steps.\n\n\"Hello!\" they cried together. \"Sorry you didn't win.\"\n\nThat was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week\nbefore.\n\n\"You don't know who we are,\" said one of the girls in yellow, \"but we\nmet you here about a month ago.\"\n\n\"You've dyed your hair since then,\" remarked Jordan, and I started\nbut the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the\npremature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer's\nbasket. With Jordan's slender golden arm resting in mine we descended\nthe steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated at\nus through the twilight and we sat down at a table with the two girls in\nyellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble.\n\n\"Do you come to these parties often?\" inquired Jordan of the girl\nbeside her.\n\n\"The last one was the one I met you at,\" answered the girl, in an alert,\nconfident voice. She turned to her companion: \"Wasn't it for you,\nLucille?\"\n\nIt was for Lucille, too.\n\n\"I like to come,\" Lucille said. \"I never care what I do, so I always have\na good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked\nme my name and address--inside of a week I got a package from Croirier's\nwith a new evening gown in it.\"\n\n\"Did you keep it?\" asked Jordan.\n\n\"Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the\nbust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two\nhundred and sixty-five dollars.\"\n\n\"There's something funny about a fellow that'll do a thing like that,\"\nsaid the other girl eagerly. \"He doesn't want any trouble with ANYbody.\"\n\n\"Who doesn't?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Gatsby. Somebody told me----\"\n\nThe two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.\n\n\"Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.\"\n\nA thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and\nlistened eagerly.\n\n\"I don't think it's so much THAT,\" argued Lucille skeptically; \"it's\nmore that he was a German spy during the war.\"\n\nOne of the men nodded in confirmation.\n\n\"I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in\nGermany,\" he assured us positively.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said the first girl, \"it couldn't be that, because he was in\nthe American army during the war.\" As our credulity switched back to\nher she leaned forward with enthusiasm. \"You look at him sometimes when\nhe thinks nobody's looking at him. I'll bet he killed a man.\"\n\nShe narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned and\nlooked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic speculation he\ninspired that there were whispers about him from those who found little\nthat it was necessary to whisper about in this world.\n\nThe first supper--there would be another one after midnight--was now\nbeing served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party who were\nspread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were\nthree married couples and Jordan's escort, a persistent undergraduate\ngiven to violent innuendo and obviously under the impression\nthat sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person\nto a greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling this party\nhad preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the\nfunction of representing the staid nobility of the countryside--East\nEgg condescending to West Egg, and carefully on guard against its\nspectroscopic gayety.\n\n\"Let's get out,\" whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and\ninappropriate half hour. \"This is much too polite for me.\"\n\nWe got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host--I\nhad never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The\nundergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.\n\nThe bar, where we glanced first, was crowded but Gatsby was not there.\nShe couldn't find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn't on the\nveranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked\ninto a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and\nprobably transported complete from some ruin overseas.\n\nA stout, middle-aged man with enormous owl-eyed spectacles was\nsitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with\nunsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he\nwheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.\n\n\"What do you think?\" he demanded impetuously.\n\n\"About what?\"\n\nHe waved his hand toward the book-shelves.\n\n\"About that. As a matter of fact you needn't bother to ascertain. I\nascertained. They're real.\"\n\n\"The books?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Absolutely real--have pages and everything. I thought they'd be a nice\ndurable cardboard. Matter of fact, they're absolutely real. Pages\nand--Here! Lemme show you.\"\n\nTaking our skepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and\nreturned with Volume One of the \"Stoddard Lectures.\"\n\n\"See!\" he cried triumphantly. \"It's a bona fide piece of printed matter.\nIt fooled me. This fella's a regular Belasco. It's a triumph. What\nthoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop too--didn't cut the pages.\nBut what do you want? What do you expect?\"\n\nHe snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf\nmuttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable\nto collapse.\n\n\"Who brought you?\" he demanded. \"Or did you just come? I was brought.\nMost people were brought.\"\n\nJordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully without answering.\n\n\"I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,\" he continued. \"Mrs. Claud\nRoosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I've\nbeen drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me\nup to sit in a library.\"\n\n\"Has it?\"\n\n\"A little bit, I think. I can't tell yet. I've only been here\nan hour. Did I tell you about the books? They're real. They're----\"\n\n\"You told us.\"\n\nWe shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.\n\nThere was dancing now on the canvas in the garden, old men pushing\nyoung girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples\nholding each other tortuously, fashionably and keeping in the\ncorners--and a great number of single girls dancing individualistically\nor relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or\nthe traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had\nsung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz and between\nthe numbers people were doing \"stunts\" all over the garden, while happy\nvacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage\n\"twins\"--who turned out to be the girls in yellow--did a baby act in\ncostume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger bowls.\nThe moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of\nsilver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the\nbanjoes on the lawn.\n\nI was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of\nabout my age and a rowdy little girl who gave way upon the slightest\nprovocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now. I\nhad taken two finger bowls of champagne and the scene had changed\nbefore my eyes into something significant, elemental and profound.\n\nAt a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.\n\n\"Your face is familiar,\" he said, politely. \"Weren't you in the Third\nDivision during the war?\"\n\n\"Why, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-Gun Battalion.\"\n\n\"I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I'd\nseen you somewhere before.\"\n\nWe talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France.\nEvidently he lived in this vicinity for he told me that he had just\nbought a hydroplane and was going to try it out in the morning.\n\n\"Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.\"\n\n\"What time?\"\n\n\"Any time that suits you best.\"\n\nIt was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around\nand smiled.\n\n\"Having a gay time now?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Much better.\" I turned again to my new acquaintance. \"This is an unusual\nparty for me. I haven't even seen the host. I live over there----\" I waved\nmy hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, \"and this man Gatsby sent\nover his chauffeur with an invitation.\"\n\nFor a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.\n\n\"I'm Gatsby,\" he said suddenly.\n\n\"What!\" I exclaimed. \"Oh, I beg your pardon.\"\n\n\"I thought you knew, old sport. I'm afraid I'm not a very good host.\"\n\nHe smiled understandingly--much more than understandingly. It was\none of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance\nin it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or\nseemed to face--the whole external world for an instant, and then\nconcentrated on YOU with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It\nunderstood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in\nyou as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it\nhad precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to\nconvey. Precisely at that point it vanished--and I was looking at an\nelegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate\nformality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he\nintroduced himself I'd got a strong impression that he was picking his\nwords with care.\n\nAlmost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler\nhurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on\nthe wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us\nin turn.\n\n\"If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,\" he urged me.\n\"Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.\"\n\nWhen he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan--constrained to assure her\nof my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and\ncorpulent person in his middle years.\n\n\"Who is he?\" I demanded. \"Do you know?\"\n\n\"He's just a man named Gatsby.\"\n\n\"Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?\"\n\n\"Now YOU're started on the subject,\" she answered with a wan smile.\n\"Well,--he told me once he was an Oxford man.\"\n\nA dim background started to take shape behind him but at her\nnext remark it faded away.\n\n\"However, I don't believe it.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she insisted, \"I just don't think he went there.\"\n\nSomething in her tone reminded me of the other girl's \"I think\nhe killed a man,\" and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I\nwould have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang\nfrom the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York.\nThat was comprehensible. But young men didn't--at least in my provincial\ninexperience I believed they didn't--drift coolly out of nowhere and buy\na palace on Long Island Sound.\n\n\"Anyhow he gives large parties,\" said Jordan, changing the subject\nwith an urbane distaste for the concrete. \"And I like large parties.\nThey're so intimate. At small parties there isn't any privacy.\"\n\nThere was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader\nrang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he cried. \"At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are\ngoing to play for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff's latest work which attracted\nso much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers\nyou know there was a big sensation.\" He smiled with jovial condescension\nand added \"Some sensation!\" whereupon everybody laughed.\n\n\"The piece is known,\" he concluded lustily, \"as 'Vladimir Tostoff's\nJazz History of the World.' \"\n\nThe nature of Mr. Tostoff's composition eluded me, because just as\nit began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps\nand looking from one group to another with approving eyes.\nHis tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and\nhis short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day. I could\nsee nothing sinister about him. I wondered if the fact that he was\nnot drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed\nto me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased.\nWhen the \"Jazz History of the World\" was over girls were putting\ntheir heads on men's shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were\nswooning backward playfully into men's arms, even into groups knowing\nthat some one would arrest their falls--but no one swooned backward on\nGatsby and no French bob touched Gatsby's shoulder and no singing\nquartets were formed with Gatsby's head for one link.\n\n\"I beg your pardon.\"\n\nGatsby's butler was suddenly standing beside us.\n\n\"Miss Baker?\" he inquired. \"I beg your pardon but Mr. Gatsby would like\nto speak to you alone.\"\n\n\"With me?\" she exclaimed in surprise.\n\n\"Yes, madame.\"\n\nShe got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment,\nand followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore\nher evening dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes--there\nwas a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to\nwalk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.\n\nI was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and\nintriguing sounds had issued from a long many-windowed room which\noverhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan's undergraduate who was now\nengaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who\nimplored me to join him, I went inside.\n\nThe large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was\nplaying the piano and beside her stood a tall, red haired young lady\nfrom a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of\nchampagne and during the course of her song she had decided ineptly\nthat everything was very very sad--she was not only singing, she was\nweeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with\ngasping broken sobs and then took up the lyric again in a quavering\nsoprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks--not freely, however, for when\nthey came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an\ninky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. A\nhumorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face\nwhereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair and went off into\na deep vinous sleep.\n\n\"She had a fight with a man who says he's her husband,\" explained a\ngirl at my elbow.\n\nI looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights\nwith men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan's party, the quartet\nfrom East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was\ntalking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife after\nattempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent\nway broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks--at intervals she\nappeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed \"You\npromised!\" into his ear.\n\nThe reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall was at\npresent occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant\nwives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised\nvoices.\n\n\"Whenever he sees I'm having a good time he wants to go home.\"\n\n\"Never heard anything so selfish in my life.\"\n\n\"We're always the first ones to leave.\"\n\n\"So are we.\"\n\n\"Well, we're almost the last tonight,\" said one of the men sheepishly.\n\"The orchestra left half an hour ago.\"\n\nIn spite of the wives' agreement that such malevolence was beyond\ncredibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were\nlifted kicking into the night.\n\nAs I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and\nJordan Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last word\nto her but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into\nformality as several people approached him to say goodbye.\n\nJordan's party were calling impatiently to her from the porch but she\nlingered for a moment to shake hands.\n\n\"I've just heard the most amazing thing,\" she whispered. \"How long were\nwe in there?\"\n\n\"Why,--about an hour.\"\n\n\"It was--simply amazing,\" she repeated abstractedly. \"But I swore\nI wouldn't tell it and here I am tantalizing you.\" She yawned\ngracefully in my face. \"Please come and see me. . . . Phone book.\n. . . Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard. . . . My aunt. . . .\"\nShe was hurrying off as she talked--her brown hand waved a\njaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door.\n\nRather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I\njoined the last of Gatsby's guests who were clustered around him. I\nwanted to explain that I'd hunted for him early in the evening and to\napologize for not having known him in the garden.\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" he enjoined me eagerly. \"Don't give it another\nthought, old sport.\" The familiar expression held no more familiarity\nthan the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. \"And don't forget\nwe're going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning at nine o'clock.\"\n\nThen the butler, behind his shoulder:\n\n\"Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.\"\n\n\"All right, in a minute. Tell them I'll be right there. . . . good\nnight.\"\n\n\"Good night.\"\n\n\"Good night.\" He smiled--and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant\nsignificance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired\nit all the time. \"Good night, old sport. . . . Good night.\"\n\nBut as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over.\nFifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and\ntumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side up but\nviolently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coup\u00e9 which had left Gatsby's\ndrive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the\ndetachment of the wheel which was now getting considerable attention from\nhalf a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as they had left their cars\nblocking the road a harsh discordant din from those in the rear had been\naudible for some time and added to the already violent confusion of\nthe scene.\n\nA man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in\nthe middle of the road, looking from the car to the tire and from the\ntire to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.\n\n\"See!\" he explained. \"It went in the ditch.\"\n\nThe fact was infinitely astonishing to him--and I recognized first the\nunusual quality of wonder and then the man--it was the late patron of\nGatsby's library.\n\n\"How'd it happen?\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I know nothing whatever about mechanics,\" he said decisively.\n\n\"But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?\"\n\n\"Don't ask me,\" said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter.\n\"I know very little about driving--next to nothing. It happened,\nand that's all I know.\"\n\n\"Well, if you're a poor driver you oughtn't to try driving at night.\"\n\n\"But I wasn't even trying,\" he explained indignantly, \"I wasn't even\ntrying.\"\n\nAn awed hush fell upon the bystanders.\n\n\"Do you want to commit suicide?\"\n\n\"You're lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even TRYing!\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" explained the criminal. \"I wasn't driving. There's\nanother man in the car.\"\n\nThe shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained\n\"Ah-h-h!\" as the door of the coup\u00e9 swung slowly open. The crowd--it was\nnow a crowd--stepped back involuntarily and when the door had opened wide\nthere was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale\ndangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the\nground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.\n\nBlinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant\ngroaning of the horns the apparition stood swaying for a moment before\nhe perceived the man in the duster.\n\n\"Wha's matter?\" he inquired calmly. \"Did we run outa gas?\"\n\n\"Look!\"\n\nHalf a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel--he stared\nat it for a moment and then looked upward as though he suspected that\nit had dropped from the sky.\n\n\"It came off,\" some one explained.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"At first I din' notice we'd stopped.\"\n\nA pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders\nhe remarked in a determined voice:\n\n\"Wonder'ff tell me where there's a gas'line station?\"\n\nAt least a dozen men, some of them little better off than he was,\nexplained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical\nbond.\n\n\"Back out,\" he suggested after a moment. \"Put her in reverse.\"\n\n\"But the WHEEL'S off!\"\n\nHe hesitated.\n\n\"No harm in trying,\" he said.\n\nThe caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and\ncut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a moon\nwas shining over Gatsby's house, making the night fine as before and\nsurviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. A\nsudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great\ndoors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host who\nstood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.\n\n\nReading over what I have written so far I see I have given the\nimpression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all\nthat absorbed me. On the contrary they were merely casual events in a\ncrowded summer and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less\nthan my personal affairs.\n\nMost of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my shadow\nwestward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the\nProbity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their\nfirst names and lunched with them in dark crowded restaurants on\nlittle pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I even had a short\naffair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the\naccounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my\ndirection so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow\nquietly away.\n\nI took dinner usually at the Yale Club--for some reason it was the\ngloomiest event of my day--and then I went upstairs to the library and\nstudied investments and securities for a conscientious hour.\nThere were generally a few rioters around but they never came into the\nlibrary so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was\nmellow I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel\nand over Thirty-third Street to the Pennsylvania Station.\n\nI began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night\nand the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and\nmachines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and\npick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few\nminutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever\nknow or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their\napartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled\nback at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the\nenchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes,\nand felt it in others--poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows\nwaiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner--young clerks\nin the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.\n\nAgain at eight o'clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were five\ndeep with throbbing taxi cabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a\nsinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited,\nand voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted\ncigarettes outlined unintelligible gestures inside. Imagining that\nI, too, was hurrying toward gayety and sharing their intimate\nexcitement, I wished them well.\n\nFor a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found\nher again. At first I was flattered to go places with her because she\nwas a golf champion and every one knew her name. Then it was\nsomething more. I wasn't actually in love, but I felt a sort of\ntender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the\nworld concealed something--most affectations conceal something\neventually, even though they don't in the beginning--and one day I found\nwhat it was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she\nleft a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied\nabout it--and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded\nme that night at Daisy's. At her first big golf tournament there was a\nrow that nearly reached the newspapers--a suggestion that she had moved\nher ball from a bad lie in the semi-final round. The thing approached\nthe proportions of a scandal--then died away. A caddy retracted his\nstatement and the only other witness admitted that he might have been\nmistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.\n\nJordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw\nthat this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence\nfrom a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest.\nShe wasn't able to endure being at a disadvantage, and given this\nunwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she\nwas very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the\nworld and yet satisfy the demands of her hard jaunty body.\n\nIt made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never\nblame deeply--I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that\nsame house party that we had a curious conversation about driving a\ncar. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our\nfender flicked a button on one man's coat.\n\n\"You're a rotten driver,\" I protested. \"Either you ought to be more\ncareful or you oughtn't to drive at all.\"\n\n\"I am careful.\"\n\n\"No, you're not.\"\n\n\"Well, other people are,\" she said lightly.\n\n\"What's that got to do with it?\"\n\n\"They'll keep out of my way,\" she insisted. \"It takes two to make an\naccident.\"\n\n\"Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.\"\n\n\"I hope I never will,\" she answered. \"I hate careless people. That's why\nI like you.\"\n\nHer grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had\ndeliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved\nher. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes\non my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of\nthat tangle back home. I'd been writing letters once a week and signing\nthem: \"Love, Nick,\" and all I could think of was how, when that certain\ngirl played tennis, a faint mustache of perspiration appeared on her\nupper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be\ntactfully broken off before I was free.\n\nEvery one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and\nthis is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n\n\nOn Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages along shore\nthe world and its mistress returned to Gatsby's house and twinkled\nhilariously on his lawn.\n\n\"He's a bootlegger,\" said the young ladies, moving somewhere between\nhis cocktails and his flowers. \"One time he killed a man who had found out\nthat he was nephew to von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil.\nReach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there crystal\nglass.\"\n\nOnce I wrote down on the empty spaces of a time-table the names\nof those who came to Gatsby's house that summer. It is an old time-table\nnow, disintegrating at its folds and headed \"This schedule in effect\nJuly 5th, 1922.\" But I can still read the grey names and they will give\nyou a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted\nGatsby's hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing\nwhatever about him.\n\nFrom East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches and a\nman named Bunsen whom I knew at Yale and Doctor Webster Civet who\nwas drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie\nVoltaires and a whole clan named Blackbuck who always gathered in a\ncorner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near.\nAnd the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr.\nChrystie's wife) and Edgar Beaver, whose hair they say turned\ncotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.\n\nClarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only\nonce, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named\nEtty in the garden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles\nand the O. R. P. Schraeders and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of\nGeorgia and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there\nthree days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the\ngravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett's automobile ran over his right\nhand. The Dancies came too and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over\nsixty, and Maurice A. Flink and the Hammerheads and Beluga the\ntobacco importer and Beluga's girls.\n\nFrom West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and\nCecil Schoen and Gulick the state senator and Newton Orchid who\ncontrolled Films Par Excellence and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don\nS. Schwartze (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the\nmovies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G.\nEarl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife.\nDa Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B.\n(\"Rot-Gut\") Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly--they came to\ngamble and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was\ncleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably\nnext day.\n\nA man named Klipspringer was there so often and so long that he became\nknown as \"the boarder\"--I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical\npeople there were Gus Waize and Horace O'Donavan and Lester Meyer and\nGeorge Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes\nand the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the\nCorrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W.\nBelcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry\nL. Palmetto who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train\nin Times Square.\n\nBenny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite\nthe same ones in physical person but they were so identical one with\nanother that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have\nforgotten their names--Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela or Gloria\nor Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names\nof flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American\ncapitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves to\nbe.\n\nIn addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O'Brien came\nthere at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer who had\nhis nose shot off in the war and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his\nfianc\u00e9e, and Ardita Fitz-Peters, and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of the\nAmerican Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip with a man reputed to be her\nchauffeur, and a prince of something whom we called Duke and whose name,\nif I ever knew it, I have forgotten.\n\nAll these people came to Gatsby's house in the summer.\n\n\nAt nine o'clock, one morning late in July Gatsby's gorgeous car\nlurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody\nfrom its three noted horn. It was the first time he had called on me\nthough I had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane,\nand, at his urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach.\n\n\"Good morning, old sport. You're having lunch with me today and I\nthought we'd ride up together.\"\n\nHe was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that\nresourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American--that comes,\nI suppose, with the absence of lifting work or rigid sitting in youth\nand, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games.\nThis quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in\nthe shape of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a\ntapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.\n\nHe saw me looking with admiration at his car.\n\n\"It's pretty, isn't it, old sport.\" He jumped off to give me a better\nview. \"Haven't you ever seen it before?\"\n\nI'd seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream color, bright\nwith nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with\ntriumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a\nlabyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind\nmany layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory we started\nto town.\n\nI had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and\nfound, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first\nimpression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had\ngradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate\nroadhouse next door.\n\nAnd then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn't reached West Egg\nvillage before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished\nand slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-colored\nsuit.\n\n\"Look here, old sport,\" he broke out surprisingly. \"What's your opinion\nof me, anyhow?\"\n\nA little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which\nthat question deserves.\n\n\"Well, I'm going to tell you something about my life,\" he interrupted.\n\"I don't want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you\nhear.\"\n\nSo he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavored conversation in\nhis halls.\n\n\"I'll tell you God's truth.\" His right hand suddenly ordered divine\nretribution to stand by. \"I am the son of some wealthy people in the\nmiddle-west--all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at\nOxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years.\nIt is a family tradition.\"\n\nHe looked at me sideways--and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was\nlying. He hurried the phrase \"educated at Oxford,\" or swallowed it or\nchoked on it as though it had bothered him before. And with this doubt\nhis whole statement fell to pieces and I wondered if there wasn't\nsomething a little sinister about him after all.\n\n\"What part of the middle-west?\" I inquired casually.\n\n\"San Francisco.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\n\"My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.\"\n\nHis voice was solemn as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan\nstill haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg\nbut a glance at him convinced me otherwise.\n\n\"After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of\nEurope--Paris, Venice, Rome--collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting\nbig game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to\nforget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.\"\n\nWith an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very\nphrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a\nturbaned \"character\" leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a\ntiger through the Bois de Boulogne.\n\n\"Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief and I tried very\nhard to die but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a\ncommission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I\ntook two machine-gun detachments so far forward that there was a half\nmile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn't advance. We\nstayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty men with\nsixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last they found\nthe insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead. I was\npromoted to be a major and every Allied government gave me a\ndecoration--even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic\nSea!\"\n\nLittle Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them--with\nhis smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro's troubled history and\nsympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It\nappreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had\nelicited this tribute from Montenegro's warm little heart. My\nincredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming\nhastily through a dozen magazines.\n\nHe reached in his pocket and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon, fell\ninto my palm.\n\n\"That's the one from Montenegro.\"\n\nTo my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look.\n\n_Orderi di Danilo_, ran the circular legend, _Montenegro, Nicolas Rex_.\n\n\"Turn it.\"\n\n_Major Jay Gatsby_, I read, _For Valour Extraordinary_.\n\n\"Here's another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It was\ntaken in Trinity Quad--the man on my left is now the Earl of Dorcaster.\"\n\nIt was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an\narchway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby,\nlooking a little, not much, younger--with a cricket bat in his hand.\n\nThen it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace\non the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with\ntheir crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.\n\n\"I'm going to make a big request of you today,\" he said, pocketing his\nsouvenirs with satisfaction, \"so I thought you ought to know something\nabout me. I didn't want you to think I was just some nobody. You see,\nI usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there\ntrying to forget the sad thing that happened to me.\" He hesitated.\n\"You'll hear about it this afternoon.\"\n\n\"At lunch?\"\n\n\"No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you're taking Miss Baker\nto tea.\"\n\n\"Do you mean you're in love with Miss Baker?\"\n\n\"No, old sport, I'm not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak\nto you about this matter.\"\n\nI hadn't the faintest idea what \"this matter\" was, but I was more\nannoyed than interested. I hadn't asked Jordan to tea in order to discuss\nMr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something utterly\nfantastic and for a moment I was sorry I'd ever set foot upon his\noverpopulated lawn.\n\nHe wouldn't say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared\nthe city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of\nred-belted ocean-going ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with\nthe dark, undeserted saloons of the faded gilt nineteen-hundreds. Then\nthe valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a glimpse\nof Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we\nwent by.\n\nWith fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half\nAstoria--only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the\nelevated I heard the familiar \"jug--jug--SPAT!\" of a motor cycle, and a\nfrantic policeman rode alongside.\n\n\"All right, old sport,\" called Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a white\ncard from his wallet he waved it before the man's eyes.\n\n\"Right you are,\" agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. \"Know you next\ntime, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse ME!\"\n\n\"What was that?\" I inquired.  \"The picture of Oxford?\"\n\n\"I was able to do the commissioner a favor once, and he sends me a\nChristmas card every year.\"\n\nOver the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a\nconstant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the\nriver in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of\nnon-olfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always\nthe city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the\nmystery and the beauty in the world.\n\nA dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two\ncarriages with drawn blinds and by more cheerful carriages for\nfriends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short\nupper lips of south-eastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of\nGatsby's splendid car was included in their somber holiday. As we\ncrossed Blackwell's Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white\nchauffeur, in which sat three modish Negroes, two bucks and a girl. I\nlaughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in\nhaughty rivalry.\n\n\"Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge,\" I thought;\n\"anything at all. . . .\"\n\nEven Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.\n\n\nRoaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby\nfor lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside my eyes\npicked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.\n\n\"Mr. Carraway this is my friend Mr. Wolfsheim.\"\n\nA small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two\nfine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I\ndiscovered his tiny eyes in the half darkness.\n\n\"--so I took one look at him--\" said Mr. Wolfsheim, shaking my hand\nearnestly, \"--and what do you think I did?\"\n\n\"What?\" I inquired politely.\n\nBut evidently he was not addressing me for he dropped my hand and\ncovered Gatsby with his expressive nose.\n\n\"I handed the money to Katspaugh and I sid, 'All right, Katspaugh,\ndon't pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.' He shut it then and\nthere.\"\n\nGatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the\nrestaurant whereupon Mr. Wolfsheim swallowed a new sentence he was\nstarting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.\n\n\"Highballs?\" asked the head waiter.\n\n\"This is a nice restaurant here,\" said Mr. Wolfsheim looking at the\nPresbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. \"But I like across the street better!\"\n\n\"Yes, highballs,\" agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfsheim: \"It's too hot\nover there.\"\n\n\"Hot and small--yes,\" said Mr. Wolfsheim, \"but full of memories.\"\n\n\"What place is that?\" I asked.\n\n\"The old Metropole.\n\n\"The old Metropole,\" brooded Mr. Wolfsheim gloomily. \"Filled with faces\ndead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can't forget so\nlong as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It was six of us\nat the table and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening. When it was\nalmost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says\nsomebody wants to speak to him outside. 'All right,' says Rosy and begins\nto get up and I pulled him down in his chair.\n\n\" 'Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don't you,\nso help me, move outside this room.'\n\n\"It was four o'clock in the morning then, and if we'd of raised the blinds\nwe'd of seen daylight.\"\n\n\"Did he go?\" I asked innocently.\n\n\"Sure he went,\"--Mr. Wolfsheim's nose flashed at me indignantly--\"He\nturned around in the door and says, 'Don't let that waiter take away\nmy coffee!' Then he went out on the sidewalk and they shot him\nthree times in his full belly and drove away.\"\n\n\"Four of them were electrocuted,\" I said, remembering.\n\n\"Five with Becker.\" His nostrils turned to me in an interested way.\n\"I understand you're looking for a business gonnegtion.\"\n\nThe juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered\nfor me:\n\n\"Oh, no,\" he exclaimed, \"this isn't the man!\"\n\n\"No?\" Mr. Wolfsheim seemed disappointed.\n\n\"This is just a friend. I told you we'd talk about that some other\ntime.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. Wolfsheim, \"I had a wrong man.\"\n\nA succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfsheim, forgetting the more\nsentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with\nferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the\nroom--he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly\nbehind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have taken one\nshort glance beneath our own table.\n\n\"Look here, old sport,\" said Gatsby, leaning toward me, \"I'm afraid I\nmade you a little angry this morning in the car.\"\n\nThere was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.\n\n\"I don't like mysteries,\" I answered. \"And I don't understand why you\nwon't come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got to\ncome through Miss Baker?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing underhand,\" he assured me. \"Miss Baker's a great\nsportswoman, you know, and she'd never do anything that wasn't all right.\"\n\nSuddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up and hurried from the room\nleaving me with Mr. Wolfsheim at the table.\n\n\"He has to telephone,\" said Mr. Wolfsheim, following him with his eyes.\n\"Fine fellow, isn't he? Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"He's an Oggsford man.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?\"\n\n\"I've heard of it.\"\n\n\"It's one of the most famous colleges in the world.\"\n\n\"Have you known Gatsby for a long time?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Several years,\" he answered in a gratified way. \"I made the pleasure of\nhis acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a man of\nfine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to myself: 'There's\nthe kind of man you'd like to take home and introduce to your mother and\nsister.' \" He paused. \"I see you're looking at my cuff buttons.\"\n\nI hadn't been looking at them, but I did now.  They were composed of\noddly familiar pieces of ivory.\n\n\"Finest specimens of human molars,\" he informed me.\n\n\"Well!\" I inspected them. \"That's a very interesting idea.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. \"Yeah, Gatsby's very\ncareful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend's wife.\"\n\nWhen the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat\ndown Mr. Wolfsheim drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet.\n\n\"I have enjoyed my lunch,\" he said, \"and I'm going to run off from you\ntwo young men before I outstay my welcome.\"\n\n\"Don't hurry, Meyer,\" said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfsheim\nraised his hand in a sort of benediction.\n\n\"You're very polite but I belong to another generation,\" he announced\nsolemnly. \"You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and\nyour----\" He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his\nhand--\"As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won't impose myself\non you any longer.\"\n\nAs he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling.\nI wondered if I had said anything to offend him.\n\n\"He becomes very sentimental sometimes,\" explained Gatsby. \"This is one of\nhis sentimental days. He's quite a character around New York--a denizen of\nBroadway.\"\n\n\"Who is he anyhow--an actor?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"A dentist?\"\n\n\"Meyer Wolfsheim? No, he's a gambler.\" Gatsby hesitated, then added\ncoolly: \"He's the man who fixed the World's Series back in 1919.\"\n\n\"Fixed the World's Series?\" I repeated.\n\nThe idea staggered me. I remembered of course that the World's Series\nhad been fixed in 1919 but if I had thought of it at all I would have\nthought of it as a thing that merely HAPPENED, the end of some\ninevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could start to\nplay with the faith of fifty million people--with the single-mindedness\nof a burglar blowing a safe.\n\n\"How did he happen to do that?\" I asked after a minute.\n\n\"He just saw the opportunity.\"\n\n\"Why isn't he in jail?\"\n\n\"They can't get him, old sport. He's a smart man.\"\n\nI insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I caught\nsight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.\n\n\"Come along with me for a minute,\" I said. \"I've got to say hello\nto someone.\"\n\nWhen he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our\ndirection.\n\n\"Where've you been?\" he demanded eagerly. \"Daisy's furious because you\nhaven't called up.\"\n\n\"This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.\"\n\nThey shook hands briefly and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment\ncame over Gatsby's face.\n\n\"How've you been, anyhow?\" demanded Tom of me. \"How'd you happen to come\nup this far to eat?\"\n\n\"I've been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.\"\n\nI turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.\n\n\nOne October day in nineteen-seventeen----\n(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight\nchair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)\n--I was walking along from one place to another half on the sidewalks and\nhalf on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from\nEngland with rubber nobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground.\nI had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind and\nwhenever this happened the red, white and blue banners in front of all\nthe houses stretched out stiff and said TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT in a disapproving\nway.\n\nThe largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to\nDaisy Fay's house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and\nby far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She\ndressed in white, and had a little white roadster and all day long\nthe telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp\nTaylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night, \"anyways,\nfor an hour!\"\n\nWhen I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside\nthe curb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen\nbefore. They were so engrossed in each other that she didn't see me until\nI was five feet away.\n\n\"Hello Jordan,\" she called unexpectedly. \"Please come here.\"\n\nI was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older\ngirls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and\nmake bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn't come\nthat day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way\nthat every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it\nseemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since. His name\nwas Jay Gatsby and I didn't lay eyes on him again for over four\nyears--even after I'd met him on Long Island I didn't realize it was the\nsame man.\n\nThat was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux myself,\nand I began to play in tournaments, so I didn't see Daisy very often.\nShe went with a slightly older crowd--when she went with anyone at all.\nWild rumors were circulating about her--how her mother had found her\npacking her bag one winter night to go to New York and say goodbye to a\nsoldier who was going overseas. She was effectually prevented, but she\nwasn't on speaking terms with her family for several weeks. After\nthat she didn't play around with the soldiers any more but only\nwith a few flat-footed, short-sighted young men in town who couldn't\nget into the army at all.\n\nBy the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a debut\nafter the Armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a\nman from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago with\nmore pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He came\ndown with a hundred people in four private cars and hired a whole\nfloor of the Seelbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave her\na string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\n\nI was bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the bridal\ndinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in\nher flowered dress--and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle of\nsauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.\n\n\" 'Gratulate me,\" she muttered. \"Never had a drink before but oh, how I do\nenjoy it.\"\n\n\"What's the matter, Daisy?\"\n\nI was scared, I can tell you; I'd never seen a girl like that before.\n\n\"Here, dearis.\" She groped around in a waste-basket she had with her\non the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. \"Take 'em downstairs and\ngive 'em back to whoever they belong to. Tell 'em all Daisy's change' her\nmine. Say 'Daisy's change' her mine!'.\"\n\nShe began to cry--she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her\nmother's maid and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath. She\nwouldn't let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her and\nsqueezed it up into a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the\nsoap dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.\n\nBut she didn't say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and put\nice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress and half an\nhour later when we walked out of the room the pearls were around her\nneck and the incident was over. Next day at five o'clock she married Tom\nBuchanan without so much as a shiver and started off on a three months'\ntrip to the South Seas.\n\nI saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back and I thought I'd\nnever seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he left the room for a\nminute she'd look around uneasily and say \"Where's Tom gone?\" and\nwear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the\ndoor. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour\nrubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable\ndelight. It was touching to see them together--it made you laugh in a\nhushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I left Santa\nBarbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night and ripped\na front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got into the\npapers too because her arm was broken--she was one of the chambermaids\nin the Santa Barbara Hotel.\n\nThe next April Daisy had her little girl and they went to France for a\nyear. I saw them one spring in Cannes and later in Deauville and then\nthey came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in Chicago,\nas you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich\nand wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation.\nPerhaps because she doesn't drink. It's a great advantage not to drink\namong hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and, moreover,\nyou can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else\nis so blind that they don't see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in\nfor amour at all--and yet there's something in that voice of hers. . . .\n\nWell, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time\nin years. It was when I asked you--do you remember?--if you knew Gatsby\nin West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me\nup, and said \"What Gatsby?\" and when I described him--I was half\nasleep--she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used\nto know. It wasn't until then that I connected this Gatsby with the\nofficer in her white car.\n\n\nWhen Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza\nfor half an hour and were driving in a Victoria through Central Park.\nThe sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in\nthe West Fifties and the clear voices of girls, already gathered like\ncrickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:\n\n\n    \"I'm the Sheik of Araby,\n    Your love belongs to me.\n    At night when you're asleep,\n    Into your tent I'll creep----\"\n\n\n\"It was a strange coincidence,\" I said.\n\n\"But it wasn't a coincidence at all.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.\"\n\nThen it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired\non that June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the\nwomb of his purposeless splendor.\n\n\"He wants to know--\" continued Jordan \"--if you'll invite Daisy to your\nhouse some afternoon and then let him come over.\"\n\nThe modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and bought a\nmansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths so that he could\n\"come over\" some afternoon to a stranger's garden.\n\n\"Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?\"\n\n\"He's afraid. He's waited so long. He thought you might be offended.\nYou see he's a regular tough underneath it all.\"\n\nSomething worried me.\n\n\"Why didn't he ask you to arrange a meeting?\"\n\n\"He wants her to see his house,\" she explained. \"And your house is right\nnext door.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties,\nsome night,\" went on Jordan, \"but she never did. Then he began asking\npeople casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found.\nIt was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have\nheard the elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately\nsuggested a luncheon in New York--and I thought he'd go mad:\n\n\" 'I don't want to do anything out of the way!' he kept saying. 'I want to\nsee her right next door.'\n\n\"When I said you were a particular friend of Tom's he started to abandon\nthe whole idea. He doesn't know very much about Tom, though he says he's\nread a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse\nof Daisy's name.\"\n\nIt was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm\naround Jordan's golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to\ndinner. Suddenly I wasn't thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more but of\nthis clean, hard, limited person who dealt in universal skepticism and\nwho leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm. A phrase began\nto beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: \"There are only the\npursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.\"\n\n\"And Daisy ought to have something in her life,\" murmured Jordan to me.\n\n\"Does she want to see Gatsby?\"\n\n\"She's not to know about it. Gatsby doesn't want her to know. You're\njust supposed to invite her to tea.\"\n\nWe passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the facade of Fifty-ninth\nStreet, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park.\nUnlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan I had no girl whose disembodied face\nfloated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so I drew up the\ngirl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth smiled and so\nI drew her up again, closer, this time to my face.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n\n\nWhen I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that\nmy house was on fire. Two o'clock and the whole corner of the peninsula\nwas blazing with light which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin\nelongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a corner I saw that it\nwas Gatsby's house, lit from tower to cellar.\n\nAt first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved\nitself into \"hide-and-go-seek\" or \"sardines-in-the-box\" with all the\nhouse thrown open to the game. But there wasn't a sound. Only wind in\nthe trees which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again\nas if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned away I\nsaw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.\n\n\"Your place looks like the world's fair,\" I said.\n\n\"Does it?\" He turned his eyes toward it absently. \"I have been glancing\ninto some of the rooms. Let's go to Coney Island, old sport. In my car.\"\n\n\"It's too late.\"\n\n\"Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven't made use\nof it all summer.\"\n\n\"I've got to go to bed.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nHe waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.\n\n\"I talked with Miss Baker,\" I said after a moment. \"I'm going to call up\nDaisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" he said carelessly. \"I don't want to put you to\nany trouble.\"\n\n\"What day would suit you?\"\n\n\"What day would suit YOU?\" he corrected me quickly. \"I don't want to put\nyou to any trouble, you see.\"\n\n\"How about the day after tomorrow?\" He considered for a moment. Then,\nwith reluctance:\n\n\"I want to get the grass cut,\" he said.\n\nWe both looked at the grass--there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn\nended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I suspected that\nhe meant my grass.\n\n\"There's another little thing,\" he said uncertainly, and hesitated.\n\n\"Would you rather put it off for a few days?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, it isn't about that. At least----\" He fumbled with a series of\nbeginnings. \"Why, I thought--why, look here, old sport, you don't make\nmuch money, do you?\"\n\n\"Not very much.\"\n\nThis seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.\n\n\"I thought you didn't, if you'll pardon my--you see, I carry on a\nlittle business on the side, a sort of sideline, you understand. And I\nthought that if you don't make very much--You're selling bonds, aren't\nyou, old sport?\"\n\n\"Trying to.\"\n\n\"Well, this would interest you. It wouldn't take up much of your\ntime and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be\na rather confidential sort of thing.\"\n\nI realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might\nhave been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer was\nobviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no choice\nexcept to cut him off there.\n\n\"I've got my hands full,\" I said. \"I'm much obliged but I couldn't take\non any more work.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't have to do any business with Wolfsheim.\" Evidently he\nthought that I was shying away from the \"gonnegtion\" mentioned at lunch,\nbut I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer, hoping I'd\nbegin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went\nunwillingly home.\n\nThe evening had made me light-headed and happy; I think I walked into a\ndeep sleep as I entered my front door. So I didn't know whether or not\nGatsby went to Coney Island or for how many hours he \"glanced into\nrooms\" while his house blazed gaudily on. I called up Daisy from the\noffice next morning and invited her to come to tea.\n\n\"Don't bring Tom,\" I warned her.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Don't bring Tom.\"\n\n\"Who is 'Tom'?\" she asked innocently.\n\nThe day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven o'clock a man in a\nraincoat dragging a lawn-mower tapped at my front door and said that\nMr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I\nhad forgotten to tell my Finn to come back so I drove into West Egg\nVillage to search for her among soggy white-washed alleys and to buy\nsome cups and lemons and flowers.\n\nThe flowers were unnecessary, for at two o'clock a greenhouse arrived\nfrom Gatsby's, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour\nlater the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel\nsuit, silver shirt and gold-colored tie hurried in. He was pale and\nthere were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.\n\n\"Is everything all right?\" he asked immediately.\n\n\"The grass looks fine, if that's what you mean.\"\n\n\"What grass?\" he inquired blankly. \"Oh, the grass in the yard.\" He looked\nout the window at it, but judging from his expression I don't believe\nhe saw a thing.\n\n\"Looks very good,\" he remarked vaguely. \"One of the papers said they\nthought the rain would stop about four. I think it was 'The Journal.' Have\nyou got everything you need in the shape of--of tea?\"\n\nI took him into the pantry where he looked a little reproachfully at the\nFinn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen\nshop.\n\n\"Will they do?\" I asked.\n\n\"Of course, of course! They're fine!\" and he added hollowly, \". . .old\nsport.\"\n\nThe rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist through which\noccasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes\nthrough a copy of Clay's \"Economics,\" starting at the Finnish tread that\nshook the kitchen floor and peering toward the bleared windows from time\nto time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking\nplace outside. Finally he got up and informed me in an uncertain voice\nthat he was going home.\n\n\"Why's that?\"\n\n\"Nobody's coming to tea. It's too late!\" He looked at his watch as if\nthere was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. \"I can't wait\nall day.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly; it's just two minutes to four.\"\n\nHe sat down, miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously there\nwas the sound of a motor turning into my lane. We both jumped up and,\na little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.\n\nUnder the dripping bare lilac trees a large open car was coming up the\ndrive. It stopped. Daisy's face, tipped sideways beneath a\nthree-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic\nsmile.\n\n\"Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?\"\n\nThe exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had\nto follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone\nbefore any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of\nblue paint across her cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as\nI took it to help her from the car.\n\n\"Are you in love with me,\" she said low in my ear. \"Or why did I have\nto come alone?\"\n\n\"That's the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far\naway and spend an hour.\"\n\n\"Come back in an hour, Ferdie.\" Then in a grave murmur, \"His name is\nFerdie.\"\n\n\"Does the gasoline affect his nose?\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" she said innocently. \"Why?\"\n\nWe went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living room was deserted.\n\n\"Well, that's funny!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"What's funny?\"\n\nShe turned her head as there was a light, dignified knocking at the front\ndoor. I went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands\nplunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of\nwater glaring tragically into my eyes.\n\nWith his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the\nhall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire and disappeared into the\nliving room. It wasn't a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of my own\nheart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.\n\nFor half a minute there wasn't a sound. Then from the living room I\nheard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh followed by Daisy's\nvoice on a clear artificial note.\n\n\"I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.\"\n\nA pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall so I went\ninto the room.\n\nGatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the\nmantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom.\nHis head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a\ndefunct mantelpiece clock and from this position his distraught eyes\nstared down at Daisy who was sitting frightened but graceful on the\nedge of a stiff chair.\n\n\"We've met before,\" muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily at\nme and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily\nthe clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his\nhead, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers and set\nit back in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the\nsofa and his chin in his hand.\n\n\"I'm sorry about the clock,\" he said.\n\nMy own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldn't muster up\na single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.\n\n\"It's an old clock,\" I told them idiotically.\n\nI think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on\nthe floor.\n\n\"We haven't met for many years,\" said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact\nas it could ever be.\n\n\"Five years next November.\"\n\nThe automatic quality of Gatsby's answer set us all back at least another\nminute. I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that\nthey help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in\non a tray.\n\nAmid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency\nestablished itself. Gatsby got himself into a shadow and while Daisy\nand I talked looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with\ntense unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn't an end in itself I\nmade an excuse at the first possible moment and got to my feet.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.\n\n\"I'll be back.\"\n\n\"I've got to speak to you about something before you go.\"\n\nHe followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door and whispered:\n\"Oh, God!\" in a miserable way.\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"This is a terrible mistake,\" he said, shaking his head from side to\nside, \"a terrible, terrible mistake.\"\n\n\"You're just embarrassed, that's all,\" and luckily I added: \"Daisy's\nembarrassed too.\"\n\n\"She's embarrassed?\" he repeated incredulously.\n\n\"Just as much as you are.\"\n\n\"Don't talk so loud.\"\n\n\"You're acting like a little boy,\" I broke out impatiently. \"Not only\nthat but you're rude. Daisy's sitting in there all alone.\"\n\n\nHe raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable\nreproach and opening the door cautiously went back into the other room.\n\nI walked out the back way--just as Gatsby had when he had made his\nnervous circuit of the house half an hour before--and ran for a huge\nblack knotted tree whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain.\nOnce more it was pouring and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by\nGatsby's gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric\nmarshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree except\nGatsby's enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church\nsteeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the \"period\"\ncraze, a decade before, and there was a story that he'd agreed to pay\nfive years' taxes on all the neighboring cottages if the owners would\nhave their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the\nheart out of his plan to Found a Family--he went into an immediate\ndecline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the\ndoor. Americans, while occasionally willing to be serfs, have always\nbeen obstinate about being peasantry.\n\nAfter half an hour the sun shone again and the grocer's automobile\nrounded Gatsby's drive with the raw material for his servants' dinner--I\nfelt sure he wouldn't eat a spoonful. A maid began opening the upper\nwindows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from a\nlarge central bay, spat meditatively into the garden. It was time I\nwent back. While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of\ntheir voices, rising and swelling a little, now and then, with gusts of\nemotion. But in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen within\nthe house too.\n\nI went in--after making every possible noise in the kitchen short of\npushing over the stove--but I don't believe they heard a sound. They\nwere sitting at either end of the couch looking at each other as if\nsome question had been asked or was in the air, and every vestige of\nembarrassment was gone. Daisy's face was smeared with tears and when I\ncame in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before\na mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding.\nHe literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new\nwell-being radiated from him and filled the little room.\n\n\"Oh, hello, old sport,\" he said, as if he hadn't seen me for years. I\nthought for a moment he was going to shake hands.\n\n\"It's stopped raining.\"\n\n\"Has it?\" When he realized what I was talking about, that there were\ntwinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man,\nlike an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to\nDaisy. \"What do you think of that? It's stopped raining.\"\n\n\"I'm glad, Jay.\" Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only\nof her unexpected joy.\n\n\"I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,\" he said, \"I'd like to\nshow her around.\"\n\n\"You're sure you want me to come?\"\n\n\"Absolutely, old sport.\"\n\nDaisy went upstairs to wash her face--too late I thought with humiliation\nof my towels--while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.\n\n\"My house looks well, doesn't it?\" he demanded. \"See how the whole\nfront of it catches the light.\"\n\nI agreed that it was splendid.\n\n\"Yes.\" His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. \"It took\nme just three years to earn the money that bought it.\"\n\n\"I thought you inherited your money.\"\n\n\"I did, old sport,\" he said automatically, \"but I lost most of it in\nthe big panic--the panic of the war.\"\n\nI think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what\nbusiness he was in he answered \"That's my affair,\" before he realized\nthat it wasn't the appropriate reply.\n\n\"Oh, I've been in several things,\" he corrected himself. \"I was in the\ndrug business and then I was in the oil business. But I'm not in either\none now.\" He looked at me with more attention. \"Do you mean you've been\nthinking over what I proposed the other night?\"\n\nBefore I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass\nbuttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.\n\n\"That huge place THERE?\" she cried pointing.\n\n\"Do you like it?\"\n\n\"I love it, but I don't see how you live there all alone.\"\n\n\"I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People who\ndo interesting things. Celebrated people.\"\n\nInstead of taking the short cut along the Sound we went down the road and\nentered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this\naspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the\ngardens, the sparkling odor of jonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn\nand plum blossoms and the pale gold odor of kiss-me-at-the-gate.\nIt was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright\ndresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the\ntrees.\n\nAnd inside as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music rooms and\nRestoration salons I felt that there were guests concealed behind\nevery couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we\nhad passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of \"the Merton College\nLibrary\" I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into\nghostly laughter.\n\nWe went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender\nsilk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing rooms and poolrooms,\nand bathrooms with sunken baths--intruding into one chamber where a\ndishevelled man in pajamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It\nwas Mr. Klipspringer, the \"boarder.\" I had seen him wandering hungrily\nabout the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby's own apartment,\na bedroom and a bath and an Adam study, where we sat down and drank a\nglass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall.\n\nHe hadn't once ceased looking at Daisy and I think he revalued\neverything in his house according to the measure of response it drew\nfrom her well-loved eyes. Sometimes, too, he stared around at his\npossessions in a dazed way as though in her actual and astounding\npresence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a\nflight of stairs.\n\nHis bedroom was the simplest room of all--except where the dresser was\ngarnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush\nwith delight and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and\nshaded his eyes and began to laugh.\n\n\"It's the funniest thing, old sport,\" he said hilariously. \"I can't--when\nI try to----\"\n\nHe had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third.\nAfter his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with\nwonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed it\nright through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak, at an\ninconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction, he was running\ndown like an overwound clock.\n\nRecovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent\ncabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and\nhis shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.\n\n\"I've got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection\nof things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.\"\n\nHe took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one\nbefore us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel\nwhich lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in\nmany-colored disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft\nrich heap mounted higher--shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in\ncoral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange with monograms of\nIndian blue. Suddenly with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into\nthe shirts and began to cry stormily.\n\n\"They're such beautiful shirts,\" she sobbed, her voice muffled in the\nthick folds. \"It makes me sad because I've never seen such--such beautiful\nshirts before.\"\n\n\nAfter the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and the\nhydroplane and the midsummer flowers--but outside Gatsby's window it\nbegan to rain again so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated\nsurface of the Sound.\n\n\"If it wasn't for the mist we could see your home across the bay,\" said\nGatsby. \"You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of\nyour dock.\"\n\nDaisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed\nin what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the\ncolossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared\nto the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed\nvery near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star\nto the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of\nenchanted objects had diminished by one.\n\nI began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in\nthe half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting\ncostume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.\n\n\"Who's this?\"\n\n\"That? That's Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.\"\n\nThe name sounded faintly familiar.\n\n\"He's dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.\"\n\nThere was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the\nbureau--Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly--taken apparently\nwhen he was about eighteen.\n\n\"I adore it!\" exclaimed Daisy. \"The pompadour! You never told me you had\na pompadour--or a yacht.\"\n\n\"Look at this,\" said Gatsby quickly. \"Here's a lot of clippings--about\nyou.\"\n\nThey stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the rubies\nwhen the phone rang and Gatsby took up the receiver.\n\n\"Yes. . . . Well, I can't talk now. . . . I can't talk now, old\nsport. . . . I said a SMALL town. . . . He must know what a small town\nis. . . . Well, he's no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small\ntown. . . .\"\n\nHe rang off.\n\n\"Come here QUICK!\" cried Daisy at the window.\n\nThe rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west,\nand there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.\n\n\"Look at that,\" she whispered, and then after a moment: \"I'd like to\njust get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you\naround.\"\n\nI tried to go then, but they wouldn't hear of it; perhaps my presence\nmade them feel more satisfactorily alone.\n\n\"I know what we'll do,\" said Gatsby, \"we'll have Klipspringer play the\npiano.\"\n\nHe went out of the room calling \"Ewing!\" and returned in a few\nminutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man with\nshell-rimmed glasses and scanty blonde hair. He was now decently clothed\nin a \"sport shirt\" open at the neck, sneakers and duck trousers of a\nnebulous hue.\n\n\"Did we interrupt your exercises?\" inquired Daisy politely.\n\n\"I was asleep,\" cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment.\n\"That is, I'd BEEN asleep. Then I got up. . . .\"\n\n\"Klipspringer plays the piano,\" said Gatsby, cutting him off. \"Don't you,\nEwing, old sport?\"\n\n\"I don't play well. I don't--I hardly play at all. I'm all out of\nprac----\"\n\n\"We'll go downstairs,\" interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The\ngrey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.\n\nIn the music room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano. He\nlit Daisy's cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on\na couch far across the room where there was no light save what the\ngleaming floor bounced in from the hall.\n\nWhen Klipspringer had played \"The Love Nest\" he turned around on the\nbench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.\n\n\"I'm all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn't play. I'm all\nout of prac----\"\n\n\"Don't talk so much, old sport,\" commanded Gatsby. \"Play!\"\n\n\n    IN THE MORNING,\n    IN THE EVENING,\n       AIN'T WE GOT FUN----\n\nOutside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the\nSound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains,\nmen-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York. It was\nthe hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating on\nthe air.\n\n\n    ONE THING'S SURE AND NOTHING'S SURER\n    THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET--CHILDREN.\n       IN THE MEANTIME,\n       IN BETWEEN TIME----\n\n\nAs I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of bewilderment\nhad come back into Gatsby's face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to\nhim as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost five\nyears! There must have been moments even that afternoon when\nDaisy tumbled short of his dreams--not through her own fault but\nbecause of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond\nher, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative\npassion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright\nfeather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can\nchallenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.\n\nAs I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took\nhold of hers and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward\nher with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most with its\nfluctuating, feverish warmth because it couldn't be over-dreamed--that\nvoice was a deathless song.\n\nThey had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand;\nGatsby didn't know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they\nlooked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I went out\nof the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there\ntogether.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n\n\nAbout this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one\nmorning at Gatsby's door and asked him if he had anything to say.\n\n\"Anything to say about what?\" inquired Gatsby politely.\n\n\"Why,--any statement to give out.\"\n\nIt transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard\nGatsby's name around his office in a connection which he either\nwouldn't reveal or didn't fully understand. This was his day off\nand with laudable initiative he had hurried out \"to see.\"\n\nIt was a random shot, and yet the reporter's instinct was right. Gatsby's\nnotoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his\nhospitality and so become authorities on his past, had increased\nall summer until he fell just short of being news. Contemporary\nlegends such as the \"underground pipe-line to Canada\" attached\nthemselves to him, and there was one persistent story that he\ndidn't live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house\nand was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore. Just why\nthese inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North\nDakota, isn't easy to say.\n\nJames Gatz--that was really, or at least legally, his name. He had\nchanged it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that\nwitnessed the beginning of his career--when he saw Dan Cody's yacht drop\nanchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior. It was James Gatz\nwho had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green\njersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby who\nborrowed a row-boat, pulled out to the TUOLOMEE and informed Cody that\na wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour.\n\nI suppose he'd had the name ready for a long time, even then. His\nparents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people--his imagination had\nnever really accepted them as his parents at all. The truth was that\nJay Gatsby, of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic\nconception of himself. He was a son of God--a phrase which, if it means\nanything, means just that--and he must be about His Father's Business,\nthe service of a vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty. So he invented\njust the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be\nlikely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.\n\nFor over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of\nLake Superior as a clam digger and a salmon fisher or in any other\ncapacity that brought him food and bed. His brown, hardening body lived\nnaturally through the half fierce, half lazy work of the bracing days.\nHe knew women early and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous\nof them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of the others\nbecause they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming\nself-absorption he took for granted.\n\nBut his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque\nand fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe\nof ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the\nclock ticked on the wash-stand and the moon soaked with wet\nlight his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the\npattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid\nscene with an oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an\noutlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the\nunreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded\nsecurely on a fairy's wing.\n\nAn instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to\nthe small Lutheran college of St. Olaf in southern Minnesota. He stayed\nthere two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of\nhis destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor's work with\nwhich he was to pay his way through. Then he drifted back to Lake\nSuperior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day\nthat Dan Cody's yacht dropped anchor in the shallows along shore.\n\nCody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields,\nof the Yukon, of every rush for metal since Seventy-five. The\ntransactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire\nfound him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and,\nsuspecting this an infinite number of women tried to separate him from\nhis money. The none too savory ramifications by which Ella Kaye, the\nnewspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him\nto sea in a yacht, were common knowledge to the turgid journalism\nof 1902. He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five\nyears when he turned up as James Gatz's destiny at Little Girl Bay.\n\nTo the young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed\ndeck, the yacht represented all the beauty and glamor in the world. I\nsuppose he smiled at Cody--he had probably discovered that people liked\nhim when he smiled. At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of\nthem elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick, and\nextravagantly ambitious. A few days later he took him to Duluth and\nbought him a blue coat, six pair of white duck trousers and a yachting\ncap. And when the TUOLOMEE left for the West Indies and the Barbary\nCoast Gatsby left too.\n\nHe was employed in a vague personal capacity--while he remained with\nCody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor,\nfor Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be\nabout and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more\ntrust in Gatsby. The arrangement lasted five years during which the\nboat went three times around the continent. It might have lasted\nindefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night\nin Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died.\n\nI remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby's bedroom, a grey, florid\nman with a hard empty face--the pioneer debauchee who during one phase\nof American life brought back to the eastern seaboard the savage\nviolence of the frontier brothel and saloon. It was indirectly due to\nCody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gay parties\nwomen used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the\nhabit of letting liquor alone.\n\nAnd it was from Cody that he inherited money--a legacy of twenty-five\nthousand dollars. He didn't get it. He never understood the legal\ndevice that was used against him but what remained of the millions\nwent intact to Ella Kaye. He was left with his singularly appropriate\neducation; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the\nsubstantiality of a man.\n\n\nHe told me all this very much later, but I've put it down here with the\nidea of exploding those first wild rumors about his antecedents, which\nweren't even faintly true. Moreover he told it to me at a time of\nconfusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and\nnothing about him. So I take advantage of this short halt, while\nGatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of\nmisconceptions away.\n\nIt was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. For\nseveral weeks I didn't see him or hear his voice on the phone--mostly\nI was in New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to\ningratiate myself with her senile aunt--but finally I went over to\nhis house one Sunday afternoon. I hadn't been there two minutes when\nsomebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink. I was startled,\nnaturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadn't happened\nbefore.\n\nThey were a party of three on horseback--Tom and a man named Sloane and\na pretty woman in a brown riding habit who had been there previously.\n\n\"I'm delighted to see you,\" said Gatsby standing on his porch.\n\"I'm delighted that you dropped in.\"\n\nAs though they cared!\n\n\"Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.\" He walked around the room\nquickly, ringing bells. \"I'll have something to drink for you in just\na minute.\"\n\nHe was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But he would be\nuneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in a vague\nway that that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted nothing. A\nlemonade? No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at all,\nthanks. . . . I'm sorry----\n\n\"Did you have a nice ride?\"\n\n\"Very good roads around here.\"\n\n\"I suppose the automobiles----\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nMoved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom who had accepted\nthe introduction as a stranger.\n\n\"I believe we've met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Tom, gruffly polite but obviously not remembering.\n\"So we did. I remember very well.\"\n\n\"About two weeks ago.\"\n\n\"That's right. You were with Nick here.\"\n\n\"I know your wife,\" continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.\n\n\"That so?\"\n\nTom turned to me.\n\n\"You live near here, Nick?\"\n\n\"Next door.\"\n\n\"That so?\"\n\nMr. Sloane didn't enter into the conversation but lounged back haughtily\nin his chair; the woman said nothing either--until unexpectedly, after\ntwo highballs, she became cordial.\n\n\"We'll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,\" she suggested.\n\"What do you say?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I'd be delighted to have you.\"\n\n\"Be ver' nice,\" said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. \"Well--think ought to\nbe starting home.\"\n\n\"Please don't hurry,\" Gatsby urged them. He had control of himself now\nand he wanted to see more of Tom. \"Why don't you--why don't you stay for\nsupper? I wouldn't be surprised if some other people dropped in from\nNew York.\"\n\n\"You come to supper with ME,\" said the lady enthusiastically.\n\"Both of you.\"\n\nThis included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.\n\n\"Come along,\" he said--but to her only.\n\n\"I mean it,\" she insisted. \"I'd love to have you. Lots of room.\"\n\nGatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn't see\nthat Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn't.\n\n\"I'm afraid I won't be able to,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you come,\" she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.\n\nMr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.\n\n\"We won't be late if we start now,\" she insisted aloud.\n\n\"I haven't got a horse,\" said Gatsby. \"I used to ride in the army but\nI've never bought a horse. I'll have to follow you in my car. Excuse me\nfor just a minute.\"\n\nThe rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began\nan impassioned conversation aside.\n\n\"My God, I believe the man's coming,\" said Tom. \"Doesn't he know she\ndoesn't want him?\"\n\n\"She says she does want him.\"\n\n\"She has a big dinner party and he won't know a soul there.\" He frowned.\n\"I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be\nold-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to\nsuit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.\"\n\nSuddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted\ntheir horses.\n\n\"Come on,\" said Mr. Sloane to Tom, \"we're late. We've got to go.\" And then\nto me: \"Tell him we couldn't wait, will you?\"\n\nTom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod and\nthey trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August\nfoliage just as Gatsby with hat and light overcoat in hand came out\nthe front door.\n\nTom was evidently perturbed at Daisy's running around alone, for on the\nfollowing Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby's party. Perhaps\nhis presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness--it\nstands out in my memory from Gatsby's other parties that summer. There\nwere the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same\nprofusion of champagne, the same many-colored, many-keyed commotion,\nbut I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that\nhadn't been there before. Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it,\ngrown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own\nstandards and its own great figures, second to nothing because it had\nno consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at it again,\nthrough Daisy's eyes. It is invariably saddening to look through new\neyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of\nadjustment.\n\nThey arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among the sparkling\nhundreds Daisy's voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.\n\n\"These things excite me SO,\" she whispered. \"If you want to kiss me\nany time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I'll be glad\nto arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card.\nI'm giving out green----\"\n\n\"Look around,\" suggested Gatsby.\n\n\"I'm looking around. I'm having a marvelous----\"\n\n\"You must see the faces of many people you've heard about.\"\n\nTom's arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.\n\n\"We don't go around very much,\" he said. \"In fact I was just thinking\nI don't know a soul here.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you know that lady.\" Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely human\norchid of a woman who sat in state under a white plum tree. Tom and Daisy\nstared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the\nrecognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.\n\n\"She's lovely,\" said Daisy.\n\n\"The man bending over her is her director.\"\n\nHe took them ceremoniously from group to group:\n\n\"Mrs. Buchanan . . . and Mr. Buchanan----\" After an instant's hesitation\nhe added: \"the polo player.\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" objected Tom quickly, \"Not me.\"\n\nBut evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained \"the polo\nplayer\" for the rest of the evening.\n\n\"I've never met so many celebrities!\" Daisy exclaimed. \"I liked that\nman--what was his name?--with the sort of blue nose.\"\n\nGatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.\n\n\"Well, I liked him anyhow.\"\n\n\"I'd a little rather not be the polo player,\" said Tom pleasantly, \"I'd\nrather look at all these famous people in--in oblivion.\"\n\nDaisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful,\nconservative fox-trot--I had never seen him dance before. Then they\nsauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour while\nat her request I remained watchfully in the garden: \"In case there's a\nfire or a flood,\" she explained, \"or any act of God.\"\n\nTom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together.\n\"Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?\" he said. \"A fellow's\ngetting off some funny stuff.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" answered Daisy genially, \"And if you want to take down any\naddresses here's my little gold pencil. . . .\" She looked around after\na moment and told me the girl was \"common but pretty,\" and I knew that\nexcept for the half hour she'd been alone with Gatsby she wasn't having\na good time.\n\nWe were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault--Gatsby had\nbeen called to the phone and I'd enjoyed these same people only two\nweeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now.\n\n\"How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?\"\n\nThe girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my\nshoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.\n\n\"Wha?\"\n\nA massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf\nwith her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker's defence:\n\n\"Oh, she's all right now. When she's had five or six cocktails she always\nstarts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it alone.\"\n\n\"I do leave it alone,\" affirmed the accused hollowly.\n\n\"We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: 'There's somebody\nthat needs your help, Doc.' \"\n\n\"She's much obliged, I'm sure,\" said another friend, without gratitude.\n\"But you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool.\"\n\n\"Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,\" mumbled Miss\nBaedeker. \"They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.\"\n\n\"Then you ought to leave it alone,\" countered Doctor Civet.\n\n\"Speak for yourself!\" cried Miss Baedeker violently. \"Your hand shakes.\nI wouldn't let you operate on me!\"\n\nIt was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with\nDaisy and watching the moving picture director and his Star. They were\nstill under the white plum tree and their faces were touching except\nfor a pale thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he\nhad been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this\nproximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate degree\nand kiss at her cheek.\n\n\"I like her,\" said Daisy, \"I think she's lovely.\"\n\nBut the rest offended her--and inarguably, because it wasn't a gesture but\nan emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented \"place\"\nthat Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village--appalled\nby its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too\nobtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short cut from nothing\nto nothing. She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed\nto understand.\n\nI sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car. It\nwas dark here in front: only the bright door sent ten square feet of\nlight volleying out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a shadow\nmoved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow,\nan indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an\ninvisible glass.\n\n\"Who is this Gatsby anyhow?\" demanded Tom suddenly. \"Some big bootlegger?\"\n\n\"Where'd you hear that?\" I inquired.\n\n\"I didn't hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are\njust big bootleggers, you know.\"\n\n\"Not Gatsby,\" I said shortly.\n\nHe was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under his\nfeet.\n\n\"Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie\ntogether.\"\n\nA breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy's fur collar.\n\n\"At least they're more interesting than the people we know,\" she said\nwith an effort.\n\n\"You didn't look so interested.\"\n\n\"Well, I was.\"\n\nTom laughed and turned to me.\n\n\"Did you notice Daisy's face when that girl asked her to put her under\na cold shower?\"\n\nDaisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper,\nbringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had\nbefore and would never have again. When the melody rose, her voice\nbroke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and\neach change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.\n\n\"Lots of people come who haven't been invited,\" she said suddenly.\n\"That girl hadn't been invited. They simply force their way in and he's\ntoo polite to object.\"\n\n\"I'd like to know who he is and what he does,\" insisted Tom. \"And I think\nI'll make a point of finding out.\"\n\n\"I can tell you right now,\" she answered. \"He owned some drug stores,\na lot of drug stores. He built them up himself.\"\n\nThe dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.\n\n\"Good night, Nick,\" said Daisy.\n\nHer glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps where\n\"Three o'Clock in the Morning,\" a neat, sad little waltz of that year,\nwas drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of\nGatsby's party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from\nher world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling\nher back inside? What would happen now in the dim incalculable hours?\nPerhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare\nand to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with\none fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would blot\nout those five years of unwavering devotion.\n\n\nI stayed late that night. Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free\nand I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run\nup, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights were\nextinguished in the guest rooms overhead. When he came down the steps at\nlast the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes\nwere bright and tired.\n\n\"She didn't like it,\" he said immediately.\n\n\"Of course she did.\"\n\n\"She didn't like it,\" he insisted. \"She didn't have a good time.\"\n\nHe was silent and I guessed at his unutterable depression.\n\n\"I feel far away from her,\" he said. \"It's hard to make her understand.\"\n\n\"You mean about the dance?\"\n\n\"The dance?\" He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of\nhis fingers. \"Old sport, the dance is unimportant.\"\n\nHe wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say:\n\"I never loved you.\" After she had obliterated three years with that\nsentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken.\nOne of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back to\nLouisville and be married from her house--just as if it were five\nyears ago.\n\n\"And she doesn't understand,\" he said. \"She used to be able to\nunderstand. We'd sit for hours----\"\n\nHe broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds\nand discarded favors and crushed flowers.\n\n\"I wouldn't ask too much of her,\" I ventured. \"You can't repeat the past.\"\n\n\"Can't repeat the past?\" he cried incredulously. \"Why of course you can!\"\n\nHe looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the\nshadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.\n\n\"I'm going to fix everything just the way it was before,\" he said,\nnodding determinedly. \"She'll see.\"\n\nHe talked a lot about the past and I gathered that he wanted to recover\nsomething, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy.\nHis life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could\nonce return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he\ncould find out what that thing was. . . .\n\n. . . One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down\nthe street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where\nthere were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight.\nThey stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night\nwith that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of\nthe year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the\ndarkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the\ncorner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalk really\nformed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees--he could\nclimb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the\npap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.\n\nHis heart beat faster and faster as Daisy's white face came up to his\nown. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his\nunutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp\nagain like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer\nto the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed\nher. At his lips' touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the\nincarnation was complete.\n\nThrough all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was\nreminded of something--an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that\nI had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to\ntake shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man's, as though\nthere was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But\nthey made no sound and what I had almost remembered was\nuncommunicable forever.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\n\n\nIt was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights\nin his house failed to go on one Saturday night--and, as obscurely as it\nhad begun, his career as Trimalchio was over.\n\nOnly gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned\nexpectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove\nsulkily away. Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out--an\nunfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously\nfrom the door.\n\n\"Is Mr. Gatsby sick?\"\n\n\"Nope.\" After a pause he added \"sir\" in a dilatory, grudging way.\n\n\"I hadn't seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr. Carraway\ncame over.\"\n\n\"Who?\" he demanded rudely.\n\n\"Carraway.\"\n\n\"Carraway. All right, I'll tell him.\" Abruptly he slammed the door.\n\nMy Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his\nhouse a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never\nwent into West Egg Village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered\nmoderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that the\nkitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village was\nthat the new people weren't servants at all.\n\nNext day Gatsby called me on the phone.\n\n\"Going away?\" I inquired.\n\n\"No, old sport.\"\n\n\"I hear you fired all your servants.\"\n\n\"I wanted somebody who wouldn't gossip. Daisy comes over quite often--in\nthe afternoons.\"\n\nSo the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the\ndisapproval in her eyes.\n\n\"They're some people Wolfsheim wanted to do something for. They're all\nbrothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nHe was calling up at Daisy's request--would I come to lunch at\nher house tomorrow? Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later\nDaisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was coming.\nSomething was up. And yet I couldn't believe that they would choose\nthis occasion for a scene--especially for the rather harrowing scene\nthat Gatsby had outlined in the garden.\n\nThe next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of\nthe summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the\nhot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush\nat noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion;\nthe woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white\nshirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers,\nlapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry. Her pocket-book\nslapped to the floor.\n\n\"Oh, my!\" she gasped.\n\nI picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it\nat arm's length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that\nI had no designs upon it--but every one near by, including the woman,\nsuspected me just the same.\n\n\"Hot!\" said the conductor to familiar faces. \"Some weather! Hot! Hot! Hot!\nIs it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it . . . ?\"\n\nMy commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand.\nThat any one should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed,\nwhose head made damp the pajama pocket over his heart!\n\n. . . Through the hall of the Buchanans' house blew a faint wind,\ncarrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we\nwaited at the door.\n\n\"The master's body!\" roared the butler into the mouthpiece. \"I'm sorry,\nmadame, but we can't furnish it--it's far too hot to touch this noon!\"\n\nWhat he really said was: \"Yes . . . yes . . . I'll see.\"\n\nHe set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to take\nour stiff straw hats.\n\n\"Madame expects you in the salon!\" he cried, needlessly indicating the\ndirection. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the\ncommon store of life.\n\nThe room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and\nJordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols, weighing down\ntheir own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.\n\n\"We can't move,\" they said together.\n\nJordan's fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in\nmine.\n\n\"And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?\" I inquired.\n\nSimultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall\ntelephone.\n\nGatsby stood in the center of the crimson carpet and gazed around with\nfascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting\nlaugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.\n\n\"The rumor is,\" whispered Jordan, \"that that's Tom's girl on the\ntelephone.\"\n\nWe were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance.\n\"Very well, then, I won't sell you the car at all. . . . I'm\nunder no obligations to you at all. . . . And as for your bothering me\nabout it at lunch time I won't stand that at all!\"\n\n\"Holding down the receiver,\" said Daisy cynically.\n\n\"No, he's not,\" I assured her. \"It's a bona fide deal. I happen to\nknow about it.\"\n\nTom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his\nthick body, and hurried into the room.\n\n\"Mr. Gatsby!\" He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed\ndislike. \"I'm glad to see you, sir. . . . Nick. . . .\"\n\n\"Make us a cold drink,\" cried Daisy.\n\nAs he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled\nhis face down kissing him on the mouth.\n\n\"You know I love you,\" she murmured.\n\n\"You forget there's a lady present,\" said Jordan.\n\nDaisy looked around doubtfully.\n\n\"You kiss Nick too.\"\n\n\"What a low, vulgar girl!\"\n\n\"I don't care!\" cried Daisy and began to clog on the brick fireplace.\nThen she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as\na freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.\n\n\"Bles-sed pre-cious,\" she crooned, holding out her arms. \"Come to your\nown mother that loves you.\"\n\nThe child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and rooted\nshyly into her mother's dress.\n\n\"The Bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy\nhair? Stand up now, and say How-de-do.\"\n\nGatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand.\nAfterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don't think he had\never really believed in its existence before.\n\n\"I got dressed before luncheon,\" said the child, turning eagerly to\nDaisy.\n\n\"That's because your mother wanted to show you off.\" Her face bent into\nthe single wrinkle of the small white neck. \"You dream, you. You absolute\nlittle dream.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" admitted the child calmly. \"Aunt Jordan's got on a white\ndress too.\"\n\n\"How do you like mother's friends?\" Daisy turned her around so that she\nfaced Gatsby. \"Do you think they're pretty?\"\n\n\"Where's Daddy?\"\n\n\"She doesn't look like her father,\" explained Daisy. \"She looks like me.\nShe's got my hair and shape of the face.\"\n\nDaisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held\nout her hand.\n\n\"Come, Pammy.\"\n\n\"Goodbye, sweetheart!\"\n\nWith a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her\nnurse's hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back,\npreceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.\n\nGatsby took up his drink.\n\n\"They certainly look cool,\" he said, with visible tension.\n\nWe drank in long greedy swallows.\n\n\"I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter every year,\" said Tom\ngenially. \"It seems that pretty soon the earth's going to fall into the\nsun--or wait a minute--it's just the opposite--the sun's getting colder\nevery year.\n\n\"Come outside,\" he suggested to Gatsby, \"I'd like you to have a look at\nthe place.\"\n\nI went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in the\nheat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea. Gatsby's eyes\nfollowed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay.\n\n\"I'm right across from you.\"\n\n\"So you are.\"\n\nOur eyes lifted over the rosebeds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse\nof the dog days along shore. Slowly the white wings of the boat moved\nagainst the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and\nthe abounding blessed isles.\n\n\"There's sport for you,\" said Tom, nodding. \"I'd like to be out there\nwith him for about an hour.\"\n\nWe had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened, too, against the heat,\nand drank down nervous gayety with the cold ale.\n\n\"What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon,\" cried Daisy, \"and the\nday after that, and the next thirty years?\"\n\n\"Don't be morbid,\" Jordan said. \"Life starts all over again when it gets\ncrisp in the fall.\"\n\n\"But it's so hot,\" insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, \"And\neverything's so confused. Let's all go to town!\"\n\nHer voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding its\nsenselessness into forms.\n\n\"I've heard of making a garage out of a stable,\" Tom was saying to\nGatsby, \"but I'm the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.\"\n\n\"Who wants to go to town?\" demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby's eyes\nfloated toward her. \"Ah,\" she cried, \"you look so cool.\"\n\nTheir eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space.\nWith an effort she glanced down at the table.\n\n\"You always look so cool,\" she repeated.\n\nShe had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was\nastounded. His mouth opened a little and he looked at Gatsby and then\nback at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as some one he knew a\nlong time ago.\n\n\"You resemble the advertisement of the man,\" she went on innocently.\n\"You know the advertisement of the man----\"\n\n\"All right,\" broke in Tom quickly, \"I'm perfectly willing to go to\ntown. Come on--we're all going to town.\"\n\nHe got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife.\nNo one moved.\n\n\"Come on!\" His temper cracked a little. \"What's the matter, anyhow?\nIf we're going to town let's start.\"\n\nHis hand, trembling with his effort at self control, bore to his lips the\nlast of his glass of ale. Daisy's voice got us to our feet and out on\nto the blazing gravel drive.\n\n\"Are we just going to go?\" she objected. \"Like this? Aren't we going to\nlet any one smoke a cigarette first?\"\n\n\"Everybody smoked all through lunch.\"\n\n\"Oh, let's have fun,\" she begged him. \"It's too hot to fuss.\"\n\nHe didn't answer.\n\n\"Have it your own way,\" she said. \"Come on, Jordan.\"\n\nThey went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling\nthe hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon hovered already\nin the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not\nbefore Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.\n\n\"Have you got your stables here?\" asked Gatsby with an effort.\n\n\"About a quarter of a mile down the road.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"I don't see the idea of going to town,\" broke out Tom savagely.\n\"Women get these notions in their heads----\"\n\n\"Shall we take anything to drink?\" called Daisy from an upper window.\n\n\"I'll get some whiskey,\" answered Tom. He went inside.\n\nGatsby turned to me rigidly:\n\n\"I can't say anything in his house, old sport.\"\n\n\"She's got an indiscreet voice,\" I remarked. \"It's full of----\"\n\nI hesitated.\n\n\"Her voice is full of money,\" he said suddenly.\n\nThat was it. I'd never understood before. It was full of money--that was\nthe inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the\ncymbals' song of it. . . . High in a white palace the king's daughter,\nthe golden girl. . . .\n\nTom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed\nby Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and\ncarrying light capes over their arms.\n\n\"Shall we all go in my car?\" suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green\nleather of the seat. \"I ought to have left it in the shade.\"\n\n\"Is it standard shift?\" demanded Tom.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, you take my coup\u00e9 and let me drive your car to town.\"\n\nThe suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.\n\n\"I don't think there's much gas,\" he objected.\n\n\"Plenty of gas,\" said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge.\n\"And if it runs out I can stop at a drug store. You can buy anything at a\ndrug store nowadays.\"\n\nA pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom\nfrowning and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar\nand vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in words,\npassed over Gatsby's face.\n\n\"Come on, Daisy,\" said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby's\ncar. \"I'll take you in this circus wagon.\"\n\nHe opened the door but she moved out from the circle of his arm.\n\n\"You take Nick and Jordan. We'll follow you in the coup\u00e9.\"\n\nShe walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan and\nTom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby's car, Tom pushed the\nunfamiliar gears tentatively and we shot off into the oppressive heat\nleaving them out of sight behind.\n\n\"Did you see that?\" demanded Tom.\n\n\"See what?\"\n\nHe looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known all\nalong.\n\n\"You think I'm pretty dumb, don't you?\" he suggested. \"Perhaps I am, but\nI have a--almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do.\nMaybe you don't believe that, but science----\"\n\nHe paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back from\nthe edge of the theoretical abyss.\n\n\"I've made a small investigation of this fellow,\" he continued. \"I could\nhave gone deeper if I'd known----\"\n\n\"Do you mean you've been to a medium?\" inquired Jordan humorously.\n\n\"What?\" Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. \"A medium?\"\n\n\"About Gatsby.\"\n\n\"About Gatsby! No, I haven't. I said I'd been making a small\ninvestigation of his past.\"\n\n\"And you found he was an Oxford man,\" said Jordan helpfully.\n\n\"An Oxford man!\" He was incredulous. \"Like hell he is! He wears a\npink suit.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless he's an Oxford man.\"\n\n\"Oxford, New Mexico,\" snorted Tom contemptuously, \"or something like\nthat.\"\n\n\"Listen, Tom. If you're such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?\"\ndemanded Jordan crossly.\n\n\"Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married--God knows\nwhere!\"\n\nWe were all irritable now with the fading ale and, aware of it,\nwe drove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg's faded\neyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby's caution about\ngasoline.\n\n\"We've got enough to get us to town,\" said Tom.\n\n\"But there's a garage right here,\" objected Jordan. \"I don't want to get\nstalled in this baking heat.\"\n\nTom threw on both brakes impatiently and we slid to an abrupt\ndusty stop under Wilson's sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged\nfrom the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.\n\n\"Let's have some gas!\" cried Tom roughly. \"What do you think we stopped\nfor--to admire the view?\"\n\n\"I'm sick,\" said Wilson without moving. \"I been sick all day.\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"I'm all run down.\"\n\n\"Well, shall I help myself?\" Tom demanded. \"You sounded well enough\non the phone.\"\n\nWith an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and,\nbreathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his face\nwas green.\n\n\"I didn't mean to interrupt your lunch,\" he said. \"But I need money\npretty bad and I was wondering what you were going to do with your\nold car.\"\n\n\"How do you like this one?\" inquired Tom. \"I bought it last week.\"\n\n\"It's a nice yellow one,\" said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.\n\n\"Like to buy it?\"\n\n\"Big chance,\" Wilson smiled faintly. \"No, but I could make some money\non the other.\"\n\n\"What do you want money for, all of a sudden?\"\n\n\"I've been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to\ngo west.\"\n\n\"Your wife does!\" exclaimed Tom, startled.\n\n\"She's been talking about it for ten years.\" He rested for a moment\nagainst the pump, shading his eyes. \"And now she's going whether she wants\nto or not. I'm going to get her away.\"\n\nThe coup\u00e9 flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a\nwaving hand.\n\n\"What do I owe you?\" demanded Tom harshly.\n\n\"I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,\" remarked\nWilson. \"That's why I want to get away. That's why I been bothering you\nabout the car.\"\n\n\"What do I owe you?\"\n\n\"Dollar twenty.\"\n\nThe relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had\na bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions\nhadn't alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some\nsort of life apart from him in another world and the shock had\nmade him physically sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made\na parallel discovery less than an hour before--and it occurred to me\nthat there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so\nprofound as the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so\nsick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty--as if he had just got\nsome poor girl with child.\n\n\"I'll let you have that car,\" said Tom. \"I'll send it over tomorrow\nafternoon.\"\n\nThat locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad\nglare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been\nwarned of something behind. Over the ashheaps the giant eyes of\nDoctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil but I perceived, after\na moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity\nfrom less than twenty feet away.\n\nIn one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside\na little and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So engrossed\nwas she that she had no consciousness of being observed and one\nemotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly\ndeveloping picture. Her expression was curiously familiar--it was an\nexpression I had often seen on women's faces but on Myrtle Wilson's\nface it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her\neyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan\nBaker, whom she took to be his wife.\n\n\nThere is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we\ndrove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his\nmistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping\nprecipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the\naccelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving\nWilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour,\nuntil, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of\nthe easygoing blue coup\u00e9.\n\n\"Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,\" suggested Jordan.\n\"I love New York on summer afternoons when every one's away. There's\nsomething very sensuous about it--overripe, as if all sorts of funny\nfruits were going to fall into your hands.\"\n\nThe word \"sensuous\" had the effect of further disquieting Tom but before\nhe could invent a protest the coup\u00e9 came to a stop and Daisy signalled us\nto draw up alongside.\n\n\"Where are we going?\" she cried.\n\n\"How about the movies?\"\n\n\"It's so hot,\" she complained. \"You go. We'll ride around and meet you\nafter.\" With an effort her wit rose faintly, \"We'll meet you on some\ncorner. I'll be the man smoking two cigarettes.\"\n\n\"We can't argue about it here,\" Tom said impatiently as a truck gave\nout a cursing whistle behind us. \"You follow me to the south side of\nCentral Park, in front of the Plaza.\"\n\nSeveral times he turned his head and looked back for their car,\nand if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into\nsight. I think he was afraid they would dart down a side street and out\nof his life forever.\n\nBut they didn't. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging\nthe parlor of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.\n\nThe prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into\nthat room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the\ncourse of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my\nlegs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back. The\nnotion originated with Daisy's suggestion that we hire five bathrooms\nand take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as \"a place to\nhave a mint julep.\" Each of us said over and over that it was a \"crazy\nidea\"--we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or\npretended to think, that we were being very funny. . . .\n\nThe room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four\no'clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from\nthe Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us,\nfixing her hair.\n\n\"It's a swell suite,\" whispered Jordan respectfully and every one\nlaughed.\n\n\"Open another window,\" commanded Daisy, without turning around.\n\n\"There aren't any more.\"\n\n\"Well, we'd better telephone for an axe----\"\n\n\"The thing to do is to forget about the heat,\" said Tom impatiently.\n\"You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.\"\n\nHe unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the towel and put it on the table.\n\n\"Why not let her alone, old sport?\" remarked Gatsby. \"You're the one that\nwanted to come to town.\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its nail\nand splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered \"Excuse me\"--but\nthis time no one laughed.\n\n\"I'll pick it up,\" I offered.\n\n\"I've got it.\" Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered \"Hum!\" in an\ninterested way, and tossed the book on a chair.\n\n\"That's a great expression of yours, isn't it?\" said Tom sharply.\n\n\"What is?\"\n\n\"All this 'old sport' business. Where'd you pick that up?\"\n\n\"Now see here, Tom,\" said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, \"if\nyou're going to make personal remarks I won't stay here a minute. Call\nup and order some ice for the mint julep.\"\n\nAs Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and\nwe were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn's Wedding March\nfrom the ballroom below.\n\n\"Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!\" cried Jordan dismally.\n\n\"Still--I was married in the middle of June,\" Daisy remembered,\n\"Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?\"\n\n\"Biloxi,\" he answered shortly.\n\n\"A man named Biloxi. 'Blocks' Biloxi, and he made boxes--that's a\nfact--and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.\"\n\n\"They carried him into my house,\" appended Jordan, \"because we lived\njust two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy\ntold him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died.\" After a\nmoment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, \"There\nwasn't any connection.\"\n\n\"I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,\" I remarked.\n\n\"That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left.\nHe gave me an aluminum putter that I use today.\"\n\nThe music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated\nin at the window, followed by intermittent cries of \"Yea--ea--ea!\"\nand finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.\n\n\"We're getting old,\" said Daisy. \"If we were young we'd rise and dance.\"\n\n\"Remember Biloxi,\" Jordan warned her. \"Where'd you know him, Tom?\"\n\n\"Biloxi?\" He concentrated with an effort. \"I didn't know him. He was a\nfriend of Daisy's.\"\n\n\"He was not,\" she denied. \"I'd never seen him before. He came down in\nthe private car.\"\n\n\"Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville.\nAsa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room\nfor him.\"\n\nJordan smiled.\n\n\"He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of\nyour class at Yale.\"\n\nTom and I looked at each other blankly.\n\n\"BilOxi?\"\n\n\"First place, we didn't have any president----\"\n\nGatsby's foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.\n\n\"By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you're an Oxford man.\"\n\n\"Not exactly.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.\"\n\n\"Yes--I went there.\"\n\nA pause. Then Tom's voice, incredulous and insulting:\n\n\"You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.\"\n\nAnother pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but\nthe silence was unbroken by his \"Thank you\" and the soft closing of the\ndoor. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.\n\n\"I told you I went there,\" said Gatsby.\n\n\"I heard you, but I'd like to know when.\"\n\n\"It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That's why I\ncan't really call myself an Oxford man.\"\n\nTom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all\nlooking at Gatsby.\n\n\"It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the\nArmistice,\" he continued. \"We could go to any of the universities in\nEngland or France.\"\n\nI wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those renewals\nof complete faith in him that I'd experienced before.\n\nDaisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.\n\n\"Open the whiskey, Tom,\" she ordered. \"And I'll make you a mint julep.\nThen you won't seem so stupid to yourself. . . . Look at the mint!\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" snapped Tom, \"I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more\nquestion.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" Gatsby said politely.\n\n\"What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?\"\n\nThey were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.\n\n\"He isn't causing a row.\" Daisy looked desperately from one to the\nother. \"You're causing a row. Please have a little self control.\"\n\n\"Self control!\" repeated Tom incredulously. \"I suppose the latest thing\nis to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife.\nWell, if that's the idea you can count me out. . . . Nowadays people begin\nby sneering at family life and family institutions and next they'll\nthrow everything overboard and have intermarriage between black\nand white.\"\n\nFlushed with his impassioned gibberish he saw himself standing alone on\nthe last barrier of civilization.\n\n\"We're all white here,\" murmured Jordan.\n\n\"I know I'm not very popular. I don't give big parties. I suppose\nyou've got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any\nfriends--in the modern world.\"\n\nAngry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened\nhis mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so complete.\n\n\"I've got something to tell YOU, old sport,----\" began Gatsby. But Daisy\nguessed at his intention.\n\n\"Please don't!\" she interrupted helplessly. \"Please let's all go home.\nWhy don't we all go home?\"\n\n\"That's a good idea.\" I got up. \"Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.\"\n\n\"I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.\"\n\n\"Your wife doesn't love you,\" said Gatsby. \"She's never loved you.\nShe loves me.\"\n\n\"You must be crazy!\" exclaimed Tom automatically.\n\nGatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.\n\n\"She never loved you, do you hear?\" he cried. \"She only married you\nbecause I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible\nmistake, but in her heart she never loved any one except me!\"\n\nAt this point Jordan and I tried to go but Tom and Gatsby insisted with\ncompetitive firmness that we remain--as though neither of them had\nanything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously\nof their emotions.\n\n\"Sit down Daisy.\" Tom's voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal\nnote. \"What's been going on? I want to hear all about it.\"\n\n\"I told you what's been going on,\" said Gatsby. \"Going on for five\nyears--and you didn't know.\"\n\nTom turned to Daisy sharply.\n\n\"You've been seeing this fellow for five years?\"\n\n\"Not seeing,\" said Gatsby. \"No, we couldn't meet. But both of us loved\neach other all that time, old sport, and you didn't know. I used to laugh\nsometimes--\"but there was no laughter in his eyes, \"to think that you\ndidn't know.\"\n\n\"Oh--that's all.\" Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman\nand leaned back in his chair.\n\n\"You're crazy!\" he exploded. \"I can't speak about what happened five years\nago, because I didn't know Daisy then--and I'll be damned if I see how you\ngot within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back\ndoor. But all the rest of that's a God Damned lie. Daisy loved me when\nshe married me and she loves me now.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Gatsby, shaking his head.\n\n\"She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas\nin her head and doesn't know what she's doing.\" He nodded sagely. \"And\nwhat's more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree\nand make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I\nlove her all the time.\"\n\n\"You're revolting,\" said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice,\ndropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: \"Do you\nknow why we left Chicago? I'm surprised that they didn't treat you to\nthe story of that little spree.\"\n\nGatsby walked over and stood beside her.\n\n\"Daisy, that's all over now,\" he said earnestly. \"It doesn't matter any\nmore. Just tell him the truth--that you never loved him--and it's all\nwiped out forever.\"\n\nShe looked at him blindly. \"Why,--how could I love him--possibly?\"\n\n\"You never loved him.\"\n\nShe hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal,\nas though she realized at last what she was doing--and as though she had\nnever, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done now.\nIt was too late.\n\n\"I never loved him,\" she said, with perceptible reluctance.\n\n\"Not at Kapiolani?\" demanded Tom suddenly.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nFrom the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up\non hot waves of air.\n\n\"Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes\ndry?\" There was a husky tenderness in his tone. \". . . Daisy?\"\n\n\"Please don't.\" Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it.\nShe looked at Gatsby. \"There, Jay,\" she said--but her hand as she tried\nto light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette and\nthe burning match on the carpet.\n\n\"Oh, you want too much!\" she cried to Gatsby. \"I love you now--isn't that\nenough? I can't help what's past.\" She began to sob helplessly.\n\"I did love him once--but I loved you too.\"\n\nGatsby's eyes opened and closed.\n\n\"You loved me TOO?\" he repeated.\n\n\"Even that's a lie,\" said Tom savagely. \"She didn't know you were alive.\nWhy,--there're things between Daisy and me that you'll never know,\nthings that neither of us can ever forget.\"\n\nThe words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.\n\n\"I want to speak to Daisy alone,\" he insisted. \"She's all excited now----\"\n\n\"Even alone I can't say I never loved Tom,\" she admitted in a pitiful\nvoice. \"It wouldn't be true.\"\n\n\"Of course it wouldn't,\" agreed Tom.\n\nShe turned to her husband.\n\n\"As if it mattered to you,\" she said.\n\n\"Of course it matters. I'm going to take better care of you from now on.\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. \"You're not\ngoing to take care of her any more.\"\n\n\"I'm not?\" Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to\ncontrol himself now. \"Why's that?\"\n\n\"Daisy's leaving you.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\n\"I am, though,\" she said with a visible effort.\n\n\"She's not leaving me!\" Tom's words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby.\n\"Certainly not for a common swindler who'd have to steal the ring he\nput on her finger.\"\n\n\"I won't stand this!\" cried Daisy. \"Oh, please let's get out.\"\n\n\"Who are you, anyhow?\" broke out Tom. \"You're one of that bunch that\nhangs around with Meyer Wolfsheim--that much I happen to know. I've made\na little investigation into your affairs--and I'll carry it further\ntomorrow.\"\n\n\"You can suit yourself about that, old sport.\" said Gatsby steadily.\n\n\"I found out what your 'drug stores' were.\" He turned to us and spoke\nrapidly. \"He and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of side-street drug stores\nhere and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. That's one of\nhis little stunts. I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw\nhim and I wasn't far wrong.\"\n\n\"What about it?\" said Gatsby politely. \"I guess your friend Walter Chase\nwasn't too proud to come in on it.\"\n\n\"And you left him in the lurch, didn't you? You let him go to jail for\na month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the subject\nof YOU.\"\n\n\"He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old\nsport.\"\n\n\"Don't you call me 'old sport'!\" cried Tom. Gatsby said nothing.\n\"Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfsheim scared\nhim into shutting his mouth.\"\n\nThat unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby's face.\n\n\"That drug store business was just small change,\" continued Tom slowly,\n\"but you've got something on now that Walter's afraid to tell me\nabout.\"\n\nI glanced at Daisy who was staring terrified between Gatsby\nand her husband and at Jordan who had begun to balance an invisible\nbut absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to\nGatsby--and was startled at his expression. He looked--and this is said\nin all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden--as if he had\n\"killed a man.\" For a moment the set of his face could be described in\njust that fantastic way.\n\nIt passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything,\ndefending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with\nevery word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave\nthat up and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped\naway, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling\nunhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.\n\nThe voice begged again to go.\n\n\"PLEASE, Tom! I can't stand this any more.\"\n\nHer frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage\nshe had had, were definitely gone.\n\n\"You two start on home, Daisy,\" said Tom. \"In Mr. Gatsby's car.\"\n\nShe looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous scorn.\n\n\"Go on. He won't annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous\nlittle flirtation is over.\"\n\nThey were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental, isolated,\nlike ghosts even from our pity.\n\nAfter a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of\nwhiskey in the towel.\n\n\"Want any of this stuff? Jordan? . . . Nick?\"\n\nI didn't answer.\n\n\"Nick?\" He asked again.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Want any?\"\n\n\"No . . . I just remembered that today's my birthday.\"\n\nI was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous menacing road of a\nnew decade.\n\nIt was seven o'clock when we got into the coup\u00e9 with him and started\nfor Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but his\nvoice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamor on the\nsidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead. Human sympathy\nhas its limits and we were content to let all their tragic arguments\nfade with the city lights behind. Thirty--the promise of a decade\nof loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning\nbrief-case of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside\nme who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten\ndreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face\nfell lazily against my coat's shoulder and the formidable stroke of\nthirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.\n\nSo we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.\n\n\nThe young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the\nashheaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had slept through\nthe heat until after five, when he strolled over to the garage and\nfound George Wilson sick in his office--really sick, pale as his own\npale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go to bed but\nWilson refused, saying that he'd miss a lot of business if he did.\nWhile his neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke\nout overhead.\n\n\"I've got my wife locked in up there,\" explained Wilson calmly.\n\"She's going to stay there till the day after tomorrow and then we're\ngoing to move away.\"\n\nMichaelis was astonished; they had been neighbors for four years and\nWilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement. Generally\nhe was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn't working he sat on a\nchair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed\nalong the road. When any one spoke to him he invariably laughed in an\nagreeable, colorless way. He was his wife's man and not his own.\n\nSo naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson\nwouldn't say a word--instead he began to throw curious, suspicious\nglances at his visitor and ask him what he'd been doing at certain\ntimes on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy some\nworkmen came past the door bound for his restaurant and Michaelis took\nthe opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he didn't.\nHe supposed he forgot to, that's all. When he came outside again\na little after seven he was reminded of the conversation because he\nheard Mrs. Wilson's voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in the garage.\n\n\"Beat me!\" he heard her cry. \"Throw me down and beat me, you dirty\nlittle coward!\"\n\nA moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and\nshouting; before he could move from his door the business was over.\n\nThe \"death car\" as the newspapers called it, didn't stop; it came out\nof the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment and then\ndisappeared around the next bend. Michaelis wasn't even sure of its\ncolor--he told the first policeman that it was light green. The other\ncar, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards\nbeyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life\nviolently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick, dark\nblood with the dust.\n\nMichaelis and this man reached her first but when they had torn open\nher shirtwaist still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left\nbreast was swinging loose like a flap and there was no need to listen\nfor the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped at the\ncorners as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous\nvitality she had stored so long.\n\n\nWe saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still\nsome distance away.\n\n\"Wreck!\" said Tom. \"That's good. Wilson'll have a little business\nat last.\"\n\nHe slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping until,\nas we came nearer, the hushed intent faces of the people at the garage\ndoor made him automatically put on the brakes.\n\n\"We'll take a look,\" he said doubtfully, \"just a look.\"\n\nI became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly\nfrom the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coup\u00e9 and walked\ntoward the door resolved itself into the words \"Oh, my God!\" uttered over\nand over in a gasping moan.\n\n\"There's some bad trouble here,\" said Tom excitedly.\n\nHe reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the\ngarage which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging wire basket\noverhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat and with a violent\nthrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through.\n\nThe circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it\nwas a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals\ndisarranged the line and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.\n\nMyrtle Wilson's body wrapped in a blanket and then in another\nblanket as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night lay on a\nwork table by the wall and Tom, with his back to us, was bending over\nit, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down\nnames with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I\ncouldn't find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed\nclamorously through the bare garage--then I saw Wilson standing on the\nraised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to\nthe doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low\nvoice and attempting from time to time to lay a hand on his shoulder,\nbut Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly from the\nswinging light to the laden table by the wall and then jerk back to\nthe light again and he gave out incessantly his high horrible call.\n\n\"O, my Ga-od! O, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!\"\n\nPresently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and after staring around the\ngarage with glazed eyes addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the\npoliceman.\n\n\"M-a-v--\" the policeman was saying, \"--o----\"\n\n\"No,--r--\" corrected the man, \"M-a-v-r-o----\"\n\n\"Listen to me!\" muttered Tom fiercely.\n\n\"r--\" said the policeman, \"o----\"\n\n\"g----\"\n\n\"g--\" He looked up as Tom's broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder.\n\"What you want, fella?\"\n\n\"What happened--that's what I want to know!\"\n\n\"Auto hit her. Ins'antly killed.\"\n\n\"Instantly killed,\" repeated Tom, staring.\n\n\"She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn't even stopus car.\"\n\n\"There was two cars,\" said Michaelis, \"one comin', one goin', see?\"\n\n\"Going where?\" asked the policeman keenly.\n\n\"One goin' each way. Well, she--\" His hand rose toward the blankets but\nstopped half way and fell to his side, \"--she ran out there an' the one\ncomin' from N'York knock right into her goin' thirty or forty miles an\nhour.\"\n\n\"What's the name of this place here?\" demanded the officer.\n\n\"Hasn't got any name.\"\n\nA pale, well-dressed Negro stepped near.\n\n\"It was a yellow car,\" he said, \"big yellow car. New.\"\n\n\"See the accident?\" asked the policeman.\n\n\"No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster'n forty. Going\nfifty, sixty.\"\n\n\"Come here and let's have your name. Look out now. I want to get his\nname.\"\n\nSome words of this conversation must have reached Wilson swaying\nin the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among\nhis gasping cries.\n\n\"You don't have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of\ncar it was!\"\n\nWatching Tom I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten\nunder his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and standing\nin front of him seized him firmly by the upper arms.\n\n\"You've got to pull yourself together,\" he said with soothing\ngruffness.\n\nWilson's eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then\nwould have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.\n\n\"Listen,\" said Tom, shaking him a little. \"I just got here a minute ago,\nfrom New York. I was bringing you that coup\u00e9 we've been talking about.\nThat yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn't mine, do you hear? I\nhaven't seen it all afternoon.\"\n\nOnly the Negro and I were near enough to hear what he said but the\npoliceman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent\neyes.\n\n\"What's all that?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I'm a friend of his.\" Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on\nWilson's body. \"He says he knows the car that did it. . . . It was a yellow\ncar.\"\n\nSome dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.\n\n\"And what color's your car?\"\n\n\"It's a blue car, a coup\u00e9.\"\n\n\"We've come straight from New York,\" I said.\n\nSome one who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this and\nthe policeman turned away.\n\n\"Now, if you'll let me have that name again correct----\"\n\nPicking up Wilson like a doll Tom carried him into the office,\nset him down in a chair and came back.\n\n\"If somebody'll come here and sit with him!\" he snapped\nauthoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced\nat each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the\ndoor on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the\ntable. As he passed close to me he whispered \"Let's get out.\"\n\nSelf consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we\npushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor,\ncase in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.\n\nTom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend--then his foot came down\nhard and the coup\u00e9 raced along through the night. In a little while I\nheard a low husky sob and saw that the tears were overflowing down his\nface.\n\n\"The God Damn coward!\" he whimpered. \"He didn't even stop his car.\"\n\n\nThe Buchanans' house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling\ntrees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor\nwhere two windows bloomed with light among the vines.\n\n\"Daisy's home,\" he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and\nfrowned slightly.\n\n\"I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There's nothing we can\ndo tonight.\"\n\nA change had come over him and he spoke gravely, and with decision.\nAs we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of\nthe situation in a few brisk phrases.\n\n\"I'll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you're waiting\nyou and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some\nsupper--if you want any.\" He opened the door. \"Come in.\"\n\n\"No thanks. But I'd be glad if you'd order me the taxi. I'll wait\noutside.\"\n\nJordan put her hand on my arm.\n\n\"Won't you come in, Nick?\"\n\n\"No thanks.\"\n\nI was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan lingered\nfor a moment more.\n\n\"It's only half past nine,\" she said.\n\nI'd be damned if I'd go in; I'd had enough of all of them for one day\nand suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of\nthis in my expression for she turned abruptly away and ran up the\nporch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head\nin my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler's\nvoice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the\nhouse intending to wait by the gate.\n\nI hadn't gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from\nbetween two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird by that\ntime because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his\npink suit under the moon.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Just standing here, old sport.\"\n\nSomehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was going\nto rob the house in a moment; I wouldn't have been surprised to see\nsinister faces, the faces of \"Wolfsheim's people,\" behind him in the\ndark shrubbery.\n\n\"Did you see any trouble on the road?\" he asked after a minute.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe hesitated.\n\n\"Was she killed?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It's better that the shock\nshould all come at once. She stood it pretty well.\"\n\nHe spoke as if Daisy's reaction was the only thing that mattered.\n\n\"I got to West Egg by a side road,\" he went on, \"and left the car in my\ngarage. I don't think anybody saw us but of course I can't be sure.\"\n\nI disliked him so much by this time that I didn't find it necessary to\ntell him he was wrong.\n\n\"Who was the woman?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it\nhappen?\"\n\n\"Well, I tried to swing the wheel----\" He broke off, and suddenly I\nguessed at the truth.\n\n\"Was Daisy driving?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said after a moment, \"but of course I'll say I was. You see,\nwhen we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would\nsteady her to drive--and this woman rushed out at us just as we were\npassing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute but it\nseemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody\nshe knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other\ncar, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second my hand\nreached the wheel I felt the shock--it must have killed her instantly.\"\n\n\"It ripped her open----\"\n\n\"Don't tell me, old sport.\" He winced. \"Anyhow--Daisy stepped on it.\nI tried to make her stop, but she couldn't so I pulled on the emergency\nbrake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.\n\n\"She'll be all right tomorrow,\" he said presently. \"I'm just going to\nwait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness\nthis afternoon. She's locked herself into her room and if he tries any\nbrutality she's going to turn the light out and on again.\"\n\n\"He won't touch her,\" I said. \"He's not thinking about her.\"\n\n\"I don't trust him, old sport.\"\n\n\"How long are you going to wait?\"\n\n\"All night if necessary. Anyhow till they all go to bed.\"\n\nA new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had\nbeen driving. He might think he saw a connection in it--he might think\nanything. I looked at the house: there were two or three bright windows\ndownstairs and the pink glow from Daisy's room on the second floor.\n\n\"You wait here,\" I said. \"I'll see if there's any sign of a commotion.\"\n\nI walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly\nand tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains were open,\nand I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where we had dined\nthat June night three months before I came to a small rectangle of light\nwhich I guessed was the pantry window. The blind was drawn but I found\na rift at the sill.\n\nDaisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table\nwith a plate of cold fried chicken between them and two bottles of\nale. He was talking intently across the table at her and in his\nearnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a\nwhile she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.\n\nThey weren't happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the\nale--and yet they weren't unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air\nof natural intimacy about the picture and anybody would have said that\nthey were conspiring together.\n\nAs I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the\ndark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in\nthe drive.\n\n\"Is it all quiet up there?\" he asked anxiously.\n\n\"Yes, it's all quiet.\" I hesitated. \"You'd better come home and get\nsome sleep.\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.\"\n\nHe put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his\nscrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of\nthe vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the\nmoonlight--watching over nothing.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\n\n\nI couldn't sleep all night; a fog-horn was groaning incessantly on the\nSound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage\nfrightening dreams. Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby's drive\nand immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress--I felt that I\nhad something to tell him, something to warn him about and morning\nwould be too late.\n\nCrossing his lawn I saw that his front door was still open and he was\nleaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.\n\n\"Nothing happened,\" he said wanly. \"I waited, and about four o'clock she\ncame to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out\nthe light.\"\n\nHis house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we\nhunted through the great rooms for cigarettes. We pushed aside curtains\nthat were like pavilions and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for\nelectric light switches--once I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the\nkeys of a ghostly piano. There was an inexplicable amount of dust\neverywhere and the rooms were musty as though they hadn't been aired for\nmany days. I found the humidor on an unfamiliar table with two stale dry\ncigarettes inside. Throwing open the French windows of the\ndrawing-room we sat smoking out into the darkness.\n\n\"You ought to go away,\" I said. \"It's pretty certain they'll trace\nyour car.\"\n\n\"Go away NOW, old sport?\"\n\n\"Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal.\"\n\nHe wouldn't consider it. He couldn't possibly leave Daisy until he knew\nwhat she was going to do. He was clutching at some last hope and I\ncouldn't bear to shake him free.\n\nIt was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with\nDan Cody--told it to me because \"Jay Gatsby\" had broken up like glass\nagainst Tom's hard malice and the long secret extravaganza was played\nout. I think that he would have acknowledged anything, now, without\nreserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.\n\nShe was the first \"nice\" girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed\ncapacities he had come in contact with such people but always\nwith indiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly\ndesirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers\nfrom Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him--he had never been\nin such a beautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless\nintensity was that Daisy lived there--it was as casual a thing to her\nas his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it,\na hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other\nbedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its\ncorridors and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in\nlavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year's shining\nmotor cars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered. It\nexcited him too that many men had already loved Daisy--it increased\nher value in his eyes. He felt their presence all about the house,\npervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.\n\nBut he knew that he was in Daisy's house by a colossal accident.\nHowever glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a\npenniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible\ncloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he made\nthe most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and\nunscrupulously--eventually he took Daisy one still October night,\ntook her because he had no real right to touch her hand.\n\nHe might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under\nfalse pretenses. I don't mean that he had traded on his phantom\nmillions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he\nlet her believe that he was a person from much the same stratum as\nherself--that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of\nfact he had no such facilities--he had no comfortable family standing\nbehind him and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government\nto be blown anywhere about the world.\n\nBut he didn't despise himself and it didn't turn out as he had\nimagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go--but\nnow he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail.\nHe knew that Daisy was extraordinary but he didn't realize just how\nextraordinary a \"nice\" girl could be. She vanished into her rich\nhouse, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby--nothing. He felt\nmarried to her, that was all.\n\nWhen they met again two days later it was Gatsby who was breathless,\nwho was somehow betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought\nluxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably\nas she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth.\nShe had caught a cold and it made her voice huskier and more charming\nthan ever and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery\nthat wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes\nand of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot\nstruggles of the poor.\n\n\n\"I can't describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her,\nold sport. I even hoped for a while that she'd throw me over, but she\ndidn't, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot\nbecause I knew different things from her. . . . Well, there I was,\nway off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and\nall of a sudden I didn't care. What was the use of doing great\nthings if I could have a better time telling her what I was going\nto do?\"\n\nOn the last afternoon before he went abroad he sat with Daisy in\nhis arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day with fire\nin the room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he\nchanged his arm a little and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The\nafternoon had made them tranquil for a while as if to give them a deep\nmemory for the long parting the next day promised. They had never been\ncloser in their month of love nor communicated more profoundly one\nwith another than when she brushed silent lips against his coat's\nshoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though\nshe were asleep.\n\n\nHe did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before he went\nto the front and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and\nthe command of the divisional machine guns. After the Armistice\nhe tried frantically to get home but some complication or\nmisunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now--there\nwas a quality of nervous despair in Daisy's letters. She didn't see why\nhe couldn't come. She was feeling the pressure of the world outside\nand she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be\nreassured that she was doing the right thing after all.\n\nFor Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids\nand pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of\nthe year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new\ntunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the\n\"Beale Street Blues\" while a hundred pairs of golden and silver\nslippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were\nalways rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low sweet fever,\nwhile fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the\nsad horns around the floor.\n\nThrough this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the\nseason; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with\nhalf a dozen men and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and\nchiffon of an evening dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor\nbeside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a\ndecision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately--and the decision\nmust be made by some force--of love, of money, of unquestionable\npracticality--that was close at hand.\n\nThat force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom\nBuchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his\nposition and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certain\nstruggle and a certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby while he was\nstill at Oxford.\n\n\nIt was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of\nthe windows downstairs, filling the house with grey turning,\ngold turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew\nand ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a\nslow pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool\nlovely day.\n\n\"I don't think she ever loved him.\" Gatsby turned around from a window\nand looked at me challengingly. \"You must remember, old sport, she was\nvery excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that\nfrightened her--that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper.\nAnd the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.\"\n\nHe sat down gloomily.\n\n\"Of course she might have loved him, just for a minute, when they were\nfirst married--and loved me more even then, do you see?\"\n\nSuddenly he came out with a curious remark:\n\n\"In any case,\" he said, \"it was just personal.\"\n\nWhat could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in\nhis conception of the affair that couldn't be measured?\n\nHe came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding\ntrip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville\non the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week, walking the\nstreets where their footsteps had clicked together through the\nNovember night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which\nthey had driven in her white car. Just as Daisy's house had always\nseemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses so his\nidea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded\nwith a melancholy beauty.\n\nHe left feeling that if he had searched harder he might have found\nher--that he was leaving her behind. The day-coach--he was penniless\nnow--was hot. He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a\nfolding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar\nbuildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow\ntrolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have\nseen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.\n\nThe track curved and now it was going away from the sun which, as it\nsank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing\ncity where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand\ndesperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of\nthe spot that she had made lovely for him. But it was all going by too\nfast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of\nit, the freshest and the best, forever.\n\n\nIt was nine o'clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the\nporch. The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there\nwas an autumn flavor in the air. The gardener, the last one of Gatsby's\nformer servants, came to the foot of the steps.\n\n\"I'm going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. Leaves'll start falling\npretty soon and then there's always trouble with the pipes.\"\n\n\"Don't do it today,\" Gatsby answered. He turned to me apologetically.\n\"You know, old sport, I've never used that pool all summer?\"\n\nI looked at my watch and stood up.\n\n\"Twelve minutes to my train.\"\n\nI didn't want to go to the city. I wasn't worth a decent stroke of work\nbut it was more than that--I didn't want to leave Gatsby. I missed that\ntrain, and then another, before I could get myself away.\n\n\"I'll call you up,\" I said finally.\n\n\"Do, old sport.\"\n\n\"I'll call you about noon.\"\n\nWe walked slowly down the steps.\n\n\"I suppose Daisy'll call too.\" He looked at me anxiously as if he\nhoped I'd corroborate this.\n\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\n\"Well--goodbye.\"\n\nWe shook hands and I started away. Just before I reached the hedge I\nremembered something and turned around.\n\n\"They're a rotten crowd,\" I shouted across the lawn. \"You're worth the\nwhole damn bunch put together.\"\n\nI've always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever gave\nhim, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end. First he nodded\npolitely, and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding\nsmile, as if we'd been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time.\nHis gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of color against the\nwhite steps and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral\nhome three months before. The lawn and drive had been crowded with the\nfaces of those who guessed at his corruption--and he had stood on those\nsteps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye.\n\nI thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thanking him for\nthat--I and the others.\n\n\"Goodbye,\" I called. \"I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.\"\n\n\nUp in the city I tried for a while to list the quotations on an\ninterminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair.\nJust before noon the phone woke me and I started up with sweat\nbreaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker; she often called\nme up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements\nbetween hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find\nin any other way. Usually her voice came over the wire as something\nfresh and cool as if a divot from a green golf links had come\nsailing in at the office window but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.\n\n\"I've left Daisy's house,\" she said. \"I'm at Hempstead and I'm going down\nto Southampton this afternoon.\"\n\nProbably it had been tactful to leave Daisy's house, but the act\nannoyed me and her next remark made me rigid.\n\n\"You weren't so nice to me last night.\"\n\n\"How could it have mattered then?\"\n\nSilence for a moment. Then--\n\n\"However--I want to see you.\"\n\n\"I want to see you too.\"\n\n\"Suppose I don't go to Southampton, and come into town this afternoon?\"\n\n\"No--I don't think this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\"It's impossible this afternoon. Various----\"\n\nWe talked like that for a while and then abruptly we weren't talking any\nlonger. I don't know which of us hung up with a sharp click but I know I\ndidn't care. I couldn't have talked to her across a tea-table that day if\nI never talked to her again in this world.\n\nI called Gatsby's house a few minutes later, but the line was busy. I\ntried four times; finally an exasperated central told me the wire was\nbeing kept open for long distance from Detroit. Taking out my\ntime-table I drew a small circle around the three-fifty train. Then I\nleaned back in my chair and tried to think. It was just noon.\n\n\nWhen I passed the ashheaps on the train that morning I had crossed\ndeliberately to the other side of the car. I suppose there'd be a\ncurious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark\nspots in the dust and some garrulous man telling over and over what\nhad happened until it became less and less real even to him and he\ncould tell it no longer and Myrtle Wilson's tragic achievement was\nforgotten. Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at the\ngarage after we left there the night before.\n\nThey had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine. She must\nhave broken her rule against drinking that night for when she\narrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the\nambulance had already gone to Flushing. When they convinced her of\nthis she immediately fainted as if that was the intolerable part of\nthe affair. Someone kind or curious took her in his car and drove\nher in the wake of her sister's body.\n\nUntil long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front\nof the garage while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the\ncouch inside. For a while the door of the office was open and\neveryone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it.\nFinally someone said it was a shame and closed the door. Michaelis and\nseveral other men were with him--first four or five men, later two or\nthree men. Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger to wait\nthere fifteen minutes longer while he went back to his own place and made\na pot of coffee. After that he stayed there alone with Wilson until dawn.\n\nAbout three o'clock the quality of Wilson's incoherent muttering\nchanged--he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car. He\nannounced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged\nto, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had\ncome from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen.\n\nBut when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry \"Oh,\nmy God!\" again in his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt\nto distract him.\n\n\"How long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sit\nstill a minute and answer my question. How long have you been married?\"\n\n\"Twelve years.\"\n\n\"Ever had any children? Come on, George, sit still--I asked you a\nquestion. Did you ever have any children?\"\n\nThe hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light and whenever\nMichaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him\nlike the car that hadn't stopped a few hours before. He didn't like to go\ninto the garage because the work bench was stained where the body had\nbeen lying so he moved uncomfortably around the office--he knew every\nobject in it before morning--and from time to time sat down beside Wilson\ntrying to keep him more quiet.\n\n\"Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if you\nhaven't been there for a long time? Maybe I could call up the church\nand get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?\"\n\n\"Don't belong to any.\"\n\n\"You ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must have\ngone to church once. Didn't you get married in a church? Listen, George,\nlisten to me. Didn't you get married in a church?\"\n\n\"That was a long time ago.\"\n\nThe effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking--for a moment he\nwas silent. Then the same half knowing, half bewildered look came back\ninto his faded eyes.\n\n\"Look in the drawer there,\" he said, pointing at the desk.\n\n\"Which drawer?\"\n\n\"That drawer--that one.\"\n\nMichaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it but\na small expensive dog leash made of leather and braided silver. It was\napparently new.\n\n\"This?\" he inquired, holding it up.\n\nWilson stared and nodded.\n\n\"I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it but I\nknew it was something funny.\"\n\n\"You mean your wife bought it?\"\n\n\"She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.\"\n\nMichaelis didn't see anything odd in that and he gave Wilson a dozen\nreasons why his wife might have bought the dog leash. But conceivably\nWilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle,\nbecause he began saying \"Oh, my God!\" again in a whisper--his comforter\nleft several explanations in the air.\n\n\"Then he killed her,\" said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly.\n\n\"Who did?\"\n\n\"I have a way of finding out.\"\n\n\"You're morbid, George,\" said his friend. \"This has been a strain to you\nand you don't know what you're saying. You'd better try and sit quiet\ntill morning.\"\n\n\"He murdered her.\"\n\n\"It was an accident, George.\"\n\nWilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly\nwith the ghost of a superior \"Hm!\"\n\n\"I know,\" he said definitely, \"I'm one of these trusting fellas and I\ndon't think any harm to NObody, but when I get to know a thing I know\nit. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he\nwouldn't stop.\"\n\nMichaelis had seen this too but it hadn't occurred to him that there was\nany special significance in it. He believed that Mrs. Wilson had been\nrunning away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any\nparticular car.\n\n\"How could she of been like that?\"\n\n\"She's a deep one,\" said Wilson, as if that answered the question.\n\"Ah-h-h----\"\n\nHe began to rock again and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in\nhis hand.\n\n\"Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?\"\n\nThis was a forlorn hope--he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend:\nthere was not enough of him for his wife. He was glad a little later when\nhe noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and\nrealized that dawn wasn't far off. About five o'clock it was blue enough\noutside to snap off the light.\n\nWilson's glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps, where small grey\nclouds took on fantastic shape and scurried here and there in the faint\ndawn wind.\n\n\"I spoke to her,\" he muttered, after a long silence. \"I told her she might\nfool me but she couldn't fool God. I took her to the window--\" With an\neffort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face\npressed against it, \"--and I said 'God knows what you've been doing,\neverything you've been doing. You may fool me but you can't fool God!' \"\n\nStanding behind him Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the\neyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg which had just emerged pale and enormous\nfrom the dissolving night.\n\n\"God sees everything,\" repeated Wilson.\n\n\"That's an advertisement,\" Michaelis assured him. Something made him turn\naway from the window and look back into the room. But Wilson stood there a\nlong time, his face close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight.\n\n\nBy six o'clock Michaelis was worn out and grateful for the sound of a\ncar stopping outside. It was one of the watchers of the night before\nwho had promised to come back so he cooked breakfast for three which\nhe and the other man ate together. Wilson was quieter now and Michaelis\nwent home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the\ngarage Wilson was gone.\n\nHis movements--he was on foot all the time--were afterward traced to Port\nRoosevelt and then to Gad's Hill where he bought a sandwich that he\ndidn't eat and a cup of coffee. He must have been tired and walking\nslowly for he didn't reach Gad's Hill until noon. Thus far there was\nno difficulty in accounting for his time--there were boys who had seen a\nman \"acting sort of crazy\" and motorists at whom he stared oddly from\nthe side of the road. Then for three hours he disappeared from view.\nThe police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he \"had\na way of finding out,\" supposed that he spent that time going from\ngarage to garage thereabouts inquiring for a yellow car. On the other\nhand no garage man who had seen him ever came forward--and perhaps he\nhad an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to know. By\nhalf past two he was in West Egg where he asked someone the way to\nGatsby's house. So by that time he knew Gatsby's name.\n\n\nAt two o'clock Gatsby put on his bathing suit and left word with the\nbutler that if any one phoned word was to be brought to him at the\npool. He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused\nhis guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him pump it up.\nThen he gave instructions that the open car wasn't to be taken out\nunder any circumstances--and this was strange because the front right\nfender needed repair.\n\nGatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once he\nstopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he\nneeded help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among\nthe yellowing trees.\n\nNo telephone message arrived but the butler went without his sleep and\nwaited for it until four o'clock--until long after there was any one to\ngive it to if it came. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn't\nbelieve it would come and perhaps he no longer cared. If that was true\nhe must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high\nprice for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up\nat an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he\nfound what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was\nupon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being\nreal, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted\nfortuitously about . . . like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward\nhim through the amorphous trees.\n\nThe chauffeur--he was one of Wolfsheim's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s--heard the\nshots--afterward he could only say that he hadn't thought anything much\nabout them. I drove from the station directly to Gatsby's house and my\nrushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed any\none. But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a word said, four\nof us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener and I, hurried down to the pool.\n\nThere was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the\nfresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other.\nWith little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden\nmattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that\nscarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental\ncourse with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves\nrevolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of compass, a thin red circle\nin the water.\n\nIt was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener\nsaw Wilson's body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was\ncomplete.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\n\n\nAfter two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the\nnext day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and\nnewspaper men in and out of Gatsby's front door. A rope stretched\nacross the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but\nlittle boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard and\nthere were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the pool.\nSomeone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the\nexpression \"mad man\" as he bent over Wilson's body that afternoon, and\nthe adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper\nreports next morning.\n\nMost of those reports were a nightmare--grotesque, circumstantial,\neager and untrue. When Michaelis's testimony at the inquest brought to\nlight Wilson's suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would\nshortly be served up in racy pasquinade--but Catherine, who might have\nsaid anything, didn't say a word. She showed a surprising amount of\ncharacter about it too--looked at the coroner with determined eyes under\nthat corrected brow of hers and swore that her sister had never seen\nGatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her\nsister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced herself of it\nand cried into her handkerchief as if the very suggestion was more\nthan she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a man \"deranged by\ngrief\" in order that the case might remain in its simplest form. And\nit rested there.\n\nBut all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself on\nGatsby's side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of\nthe catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and\nevery practical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and\nconfused; then, as he lay in his house and didn't move or breathe or\nspeak hour upon hour it grew upon me that I was responsible, because no\none else was interested--interested, I mean, with that intense personal\ninterest to which every one has some vague right at the end.\n\nI called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her\ninstinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away\nearly that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.\n\n\"Left no address?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Say when they'd be back?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Any idea where they are? How I could reach them?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Can't say.\"\n\nI wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where he\nlay and reassure him: \"I'll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don't worry.\nJust trust me and I'll get somebody for you----\"\n\nMeyer Wolfsheim's name wasn't in the phone book. The butler gave me his\noffice address on Broadway and I called Information, but by the time I\nhad the number it was long after five and no one answered the phone.\n\n\"Will you ring again?\"\n\n\"I've rung them three times.\"\n\n\"It's very important.\"\n\n\"Sorry. I'm afraid no one's there.\"\n\nI went back to the drawing room and thought for an instant that they were\nchance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it. But\nas they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with unmoved eyes,\nhis protest continued in my brain.\n\n\"Look here, old sport, you've got to get somebody for me. You've got\nto try hard. I can't go through this alone.\"\n\nSome one started to ask me questions but I broke away and going upstairs\nlooked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk--he'd never told me\ndefinitely that his parents were dead. But there was nothing--only the\npicture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence staring down from\nthe wall.\n\nNext morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfsheim\nwhich asked for information and urged him to come out on the next\ntrain. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure he'd\nstart when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there'd be a wire\nfrom Daisy before noon--but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfsheim arrived, no\none arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men.\nWhen the butler brought back Wolfsheim's answer I began to have a\nfeeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me\nagainst them all.\n\n\n_Dear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my\nlife to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a mad\nact as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down now as\nI am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in\nthis thing now. If there is anything I can do a little later let me\nknow in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when I hear about a\nthing like this and am completely knocked down and out.\n\n                                        Yours truly\n                                                      MEYER Wolfsheim_\n\nand then hasty addenda beneath:\n\n_Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all._\n\n\nWhen the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was\ncalling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came\nthrough as a man's voice, very thin and far away.\n\n\"This is Slagle speaking. . . .\"\n\n\"Yes?\" The name was unfamiliar.\n\n\"Hell of a note, isn't it? Get my wire?\"\n\n\"There haven't been any wires.\"\n\n\"Young Parke's in trouble,\" he said rapidly. \"They picked him up when he\nhanded the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New York\ngiving 'em the numbers just five minutes before. What d'you know about\nthat, hey? You never can tell in these hick towns----\"\n\n\"Hello!\" I interrupted breathlessly. \"Look here--this isn't Mr. Gatsby.\nMr. Gatsby's dead.\"\n\nThere was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an\nexclamation . . . then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.\n\n\nI think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz\narrived from a town in Minnesota. It said only that the sender was\nleaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.\n\nIt was Gatsby's father, a solemn old man very helpless and dismayed,\nbundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day. His\neyes leaked continuously with excitement and when I took the bag and\numbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse\ngrey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was on the\npoint of collapse so I took him into the music room and made him sit\ndown while I sent for something to eat. But he wouldn't eat and the\nglass of milk spilled from his trembling hand.\n\n\"I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,\" he said. \"It was all in the Chicago\nnewspaper. I started right away.\"\n\n\"I didn't know how to reach you.\"\n\nHis eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room.\n\n\"It was a mad man,\" he said. \"He must have been mad.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you like some coffee?\" I urged him.\n\n\"I don't want anything. I'm all right now, Mr.----\"\n\n\"Carraway.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?\"\n\nI took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him there.\nSome little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall;\nwhen I told them who had arrived they went reluctantly away.\n\nAfter a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth\najar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and\nunpunctual tears. He had reached an age where death no longer has the\nquality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the\nfirst time and saw the height and splendor of the hall and the great\nrooms opening out from it into other rooms his grief began to be mixed\nwith an awed pride. I helped him to a bedroom upstairs; while he took\noff his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been\ndeferred until he came.\n\n\"I didn't know what you'd want, Mr. Gatsby----\"\n\n\"Gatz is my name.\"\n\n\"--Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body west.\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position in\nthe East. Were you a friend of my boy's, Mr.--?\"\n\n\"We were close friends.\"\n\n\"He had a big future before him, you know. He was only a young man but\nhe had a lot of brain power here.\"\n\nHe touched his head impressively and I nodded.\n\n\"If he'd of lived he'd of been a great man. A man like James J. Hill.\nHe'd of helped build up the country.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" I said, uncomfortably.\n\nHe fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the bed,\nand lay down stiffly--was instantly asleep.\n\nThat night an obviously frightened person called up and demanded to know\nwho I was before he would give his name.\n\n\"This is Mr. Carraway,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh--\" He sounded relieved. \"This is Klipspringer.\"\n\nI was relieved too for that seemed to promise another friend\nat Gatsby's grave. I didn't want it to be in the papers and draw\na sightseeing crowd so I'd been calling up a few people myself.\nThey were hard to find.\n\n\"The funeral's tomorrow,\" I said. \"Three o'clock, here at the house.\nI wish you'd tell anybody who'd be interested.\"\n\n\"Oh, I will,\" he broke out hastily. \"Of course I'm not likely to see\nanybody, but if I do.\"\n\nHis tone made me suspicious.\n\n\"Of course you'll be there yourself.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll certainly try. What I called up about is----\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" I interrupted. \"How about saying you'll come?\"\n\n\"Well, the fact is--the truth of the matter is that I'm staying with\nsome people up here in Greenwich and they rather expect me to be with\nthem tomorrow. In fact there's a sort of picnic or something.\nOf course I'll do my very best to get away.\"\n\nI ejaculated an unrestrained \"Huh!\" and he must have heard me for he went\non nervously:\n\n\"What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. I wonder if\nit'd be too much trouble to have the butler send them on. You\nsee they're tennis shoes and I'm sort of helpless without them. My\naddress is care of B. F.----\"\n\nI didn't hear the rest of the name because I hung up the receiver.\n\nAfter that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby--one gentleman to whom I\ntelephoned implied that he had got what he deserved. However, that was\nmy fault, for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at\nGatsby on the courage of Gatsby's liquor and I should have known\nbetter than to call him.\n\nThe morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer\nWolfsheim; I couldn't seem to reach him any other way. The door that I\npushed open on the advice of an elevator boy was marked \"The Swastika\nHolding Company\" and at first there didn't seem to be any one inside.\nBut when I'd shouted \"Hello\" several times in vain an argument broke\nout behind a partition and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an\ninterior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes.\n\n\"Nobody's in,\" she said. \"Mr. Wolfsheim's gone to Chicago.\"\n\nThe first part of this was obviously untrue for someone had begun to\nwhistle \"The Rosary,\" tunelessly, inside.\n\n\"Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.\"\n\n\"I can't get him back from Chicago, can I?\"\n\nAt this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfsheim's called \"Stella!\"\nfrom the other side of the door.\n\n\"Leave your name on the desk,\" she said quickly. \"I'll give it to him\nwhen he gets back.\"\n\n\"But I know he's there.\"\n\nShe took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up\nand down her hips.\n\n\"You young men think you can force your way in here any time,\" she\nscolded. \"We're getting sickantired of it. When I say he's in Chicago,\nhe's in ChiCAgo.\"\n\nI mentioned Gatsby.\n\n\"Oh--h!\" She looked at me over again. \"Will you just--what was your name?\"\n\nShe vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfsheim stood solemnly in the doorway,\nholding out both hands. He drew me into his office, remarking in a\nreverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered me\na cigar.\n\n\"My memory goes back to when I first met him,\" he said. \"A young\nmajor just out of the army and covered over with medals he got\nin the war. He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform\nbecause he couldn't buy some regular clothes. First time I saw him was\nwhen he come into Winebrenner's poolroom at Forty-third Street and\nasked for a job. He hadn't eat anything for a couple of days. 'Come on\nhave some lunch with me,' I sid. He ate more than four dollars' worth of\nfood in half an hour.\"\n\n\"Did you start him in business?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Start him! I made him.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right\naway he was a fine appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told\nme he was an Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join up\nin the American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he\ndid some work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like\nthat in everything--\" He held up two bulbous fingers \"--always\ntogether.\"\n\nI wondered if this partnership had included the World's Series transaction\nin 1919.\n\n\"Now he's dead,\" I said after a moment. \"You were his closest friend,\nso I know you'll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.\"\n\n\"I'd like to come.\"\n\n\"Well, come then.\"\n\nThe hair in his nostrils quivered slightly and as he shook his head his\neyes filled with tears.\n\n\"I can't do it--I can't get mixed up in it,\" he said.\n\n\"There's nothing to get mixed up in. It's all over now.\"\n\n\"When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way.\nI keep out. When I was a young man it was different--if a friend of mine\ndied, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You may think that's\nsentimental but I mean it--to the bitter end.\"\n\nI saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come,\nso I stood up.\n\n\"Are you a college man?\" he inquired suddenly.\n\nFor a moment I thought he was going to suggest a \"gonnegtion\" but he\nonly nodded and shook my hand.\n\n\"Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not\nafter he is dead,\" he suggested. \"After that my own rule is to let\neverything alone.\"\n\nWhen I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West Egg\nin a drizzle. After changing my clothes I went next door and found\nMr. Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall. His pride in his\nson and in his son's possessions was continually increasing and now he\nhad something to show me.\n\n\"Jimmy sent me this picture.\" He took out his wallet with trembling\nfingers. \"Look there.\"\n\nIt was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirty with\nmany hands. He pointed out every detail to me eagerly. \"Look there!\" and\nthen sought admiration from my eyes. He had shown it so often that I think\nit was more real to him now than the house itself.\n\n\"Jimmy sent it to me. I think it's a very pretty picture. It shows up\nwell.\"\n\n\"Very well. Had you seen him lately?\"\n\n\"He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in\nnow. Of course we was broke up when he run off from home but I see now\nthere was a reason for it. He knew he had a big future in front of him.\nAnd ever since he made a success he was very generous with me.\"\n\nHe seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another minute,\nlingeringly, before my eyes. Then he returned the wallet and pulled from\nhis pocket a ragged old copy of a book called \"Hopalong Cassidy.\"\n\n\"Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows\nyou.\"\n\nHe opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see.\nOn the last fly-leaf was printed the word SCHEDULE, and the date\nSeptember 12th, 1906. And underneath:\n\n\nRise from bed . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  6.00       A.M.\nDumbbell exercise and wall-scaling . . . . . . 6.15-6.30   \"\nStudy electricity, etc . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.15-8.15   \"\nWork . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8.30-4.30  P.M.\nBaseball and sports . . . . . . . . . . . . .  4.30-5.00   \"\nPractice elocution, poise and how to attain it 5.00-6.00   \"\nStudy needed inventions . . . . . . . . . . .  7.00-9.00   \"\n\n                GENERAL RESOLVES\n\nNo wasting time at Shafters or [a name, indecipherable]\nNo more smokeing or chewing\nBath every other day\nRead one improving book or magazine per week\nSave $5.00 [crossed out] $3.00 per week\nBe better to parents\n\n\n\"I come across this book by accident,\" said the old man. \"It just shows\nyou, don't it?\"\n\n\"It just shows you.\"\n\n\"Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this or\nsomething. Do you notice what he's got about improving his mind? He was\nalways great for that. He told me I et like a hog once and I beat him\nfor it.\"\n\nHe was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then\nlooking eagerly at me. I think he rather expected me to copy down the\nlist for my own use.\n\nA little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing and\nI began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars. So did\nGatsby's father. And as the time passed and the servants came in and\nstood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously and he\nspoke of the rain in a worried uncertain way. The minister glanced\nseveral times at his watch so I took him aside and asked him to wait\nfor half an hour. But it wasn't any use. Nobody came.\n\n\nAbout five o'clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery\nand stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate--first a motor hearse,\nhorribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and I in the\nlimousine, and, a little later, four or five servants and the postman\nfrom West Egg in Gatsby's station wagon, all wet to the skin. As we\nstarted through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then\nthe sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. I looked\naround. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found\nmarvelling over Gatsby's books in the library one night three months\nbefore.\n\nI'd never seen him since then. I don't know how he knew about the\nfuneral or even his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses and\nhe took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled\nfrom Gatsby's grave.\n\nI tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment but he was already too\nfar away and I could only remember, without resentment, that Daisy\nhadn't sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur\n\"Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,\" and then the owl-eyed\nman said \"Amen to that,\" in a brave voice.\n\nWe straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-Eyes spoke\nto me by the gate.\n\n\"I couldn't get to the house,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Neither could anybody else.\"\n\n\"Go on!\" He started. \"Why, my God! they used to go there by the\nhundreds.\"\n\nHe took off his glasses and wiped them again outside and in.\n\n\"The poor son-of-a-bitch,\" he said.\n\n\nOne of my most vivid memories is of coming back west from prep school\nand later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than\nChicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o'clock of a\nDecember evening with a few Chicago friends already caught up into\ntheir own holiday gayeties to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember\nthe fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This or That's and\nthe chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as\nwe caught sight of old acquaintances and the matchings of invitations:\n\"Are you going to the Ordways'? the Herseys'? the Schultzes'?\"\nand the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands.\nAnd last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul\nRailroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside\nthe gate.\n\nWhen we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow,\nbegan to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the\ndim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace\ncame suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked\nback from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our\nidentity with this country for one strange hour before we melted\nindistinguishably into it again.\n\nThat's my middle west--not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede\ntowns but the thrilling, returning trains of my youth and the street\nlamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly\nwreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a\nlittle solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent\nfrom growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are\nstill called through decades by a family's name. I see now that this\nhas been a story of the West, after all--Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and\nJordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some\ndeficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.\n\nEven when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware\nof its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the\nOhio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the\nchildren and the very old--even then it had always for me a quality of\ndistortion. West Egg especially still figures in my more fantastic\ndreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at\nonce conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging\nsky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress\nsuits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a\ndrunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over\nthe side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a\nhouse--the wrong house. But no one knows the woman's name, and no one\ncares.\n\nAfter Gatsby's death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted\nbeyond my eyes' power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle\nleaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the\nline I decided to come back home.\n\nThere was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant\nthing that perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted to\nleave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent\nsea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and\naround what had happened to us together and what had happened\nafterward to me, and she lay perfectly still listening in a big\nchair.\n\nShe was dressed to play golf and I remember thinking she looked like a\ngood illustration, her chin raised a little, jauntily, her hair the\ncolor of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless\nglove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without comment that\nshe was engaged to another man. I doubted that though there were\nseveral she could have married at a nod of her head but I pretended to\nbe surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn't making a\nmistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say\ngoodbye.\n\n\"Nevertheless you did throw me over,\" said Jordan suddenly. \"You threw me\nover on the telephone. I don't give a damn about you now but it was a\nnew experience for me and I felt a little dizzy for a while.\"\n\nWe shook hands.\n\n\"Oh, and do you remember--\" she added, \"----a conversation we had once\nabout driving a car?\"\n\n\"Why--not exactly.\"\n\n\"You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver?\nWell, I met another bad driver, didn't I? I mean it was careless of me\nto make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest,\nstraightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.\"\n\n\"I'm thirty,\" I said. \"I'm five years too old to lie to myself and call\nit honor.\"\n\nShe didn't answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously\nsorry, I turned away.\n\n\nOne afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead\nof me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a\nlittle from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving\nsharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as I\nslowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into\nthe windows of a jewelry store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back\nholding out his hand.\n\n\"What's the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?\"\n\n\"Yes. You know what I think of you.\"\n\n\"You're crazy, Nick,\" he said quickly. \"Crazy as hell. I don't know\nwhat's the matter with you.\"\n\n\"Tom,\" I inquired, \"what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?\"\n\nHe stared at me without a word and I knew I had guessed right about\nthose missing hours. I started to turn away but he took a step after me\nand grabbed my arm.\n\n\"I told him the truth,\" he said. \"He came to the door while we were\ngetting ready to leave and when I sent down word that we weren't in he\ntried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if I\nhadn't told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his\npocket every minute he was in the house----\" He broke off defiantly.\n\"What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw\ndust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy's but he was a tough\none. He ran over Myrtle like you'd run over a dog and never even stopped\nhis car.\"\n\nThere was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact\nthat it wasn't true.\n\n\"And if you think I didn't have my share of suffering--look here, when I\nwent to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting\nthere on the sideboard I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it\nwas awful----\"\n\nI couldn't forgive him or like him but I saw that what he had done was,\nto him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused.\nThey were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and\ncreatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast\ncarelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other\npeople clean up the mess they had made. . . .\n\nI shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as\nthough I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewelry store to\nbuy a pearl necklace--or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons--rid of my\nprovincial squeamishness forever.\n\n\nGatsby's house was still empty when I left--the grass on his lawn had\ngrown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village never\ntook a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and\npointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to\nEast Egg the night of the accident and perhaps he had made a story\nabout it all his own. I didn't want to hear it and I avoided him when I\ngot off the train.\n\nI spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling\nparties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the\nmusic and the laughter faint and incessant from his garden and the\ncars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a material car\nthere and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I didn't\ninvestigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the\nends of the earth and didn't know that the party was over.\n\nOn the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer,\nI went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once\nmore. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a\npiece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight and I erased it,\ndrawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the\nbeach and sprawled out on the sand.\n\nMost of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any\nlights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound.\nAnd as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away\nuntil gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered\nonce for Dutch sailors' eyes--a fresh, green breast of the new world.\nIts vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby's house, had\nonce pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams;\nfor a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the\npresence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation\nhe neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in\nhistory with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.\n\nAnd as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of\nGatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of\nDaisy's dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must\nhave seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not\nknow that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity\nbeyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under\nthe night.\n\nGatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by\nyear recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow\nwe will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine\nmorning----\n\nSo we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into\nthe past.\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nProject Gutenberg Australia",
        "summary": "**Summary of \"The Great Gatsby\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald**\n\n\"The Great Gatsby\" revolves around the mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his obsession with the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. The story is narrated by Nick Carraway, who moves to West Egg, Long Island, where he becomes Gatsby's neighbor.\n\nGatsby throws extravagant parties in hopes of attracting Daisy, his former lover. As their relationship rekindles, tensions arise due to Tom Buchanan, Daisy's wealthy husband, and his suspicions of Gatsby\u2019s past and wealth. Tom represents old money, while Gatsby symbolizes new money and the American Dream gone awry.\n\nAmidst the novel, themes of love, wealth, class, and the pursuit of the American Dream are explored. Gatsby's lavish lifestyle is contrasted with the grim realities in the valley of ashes, portrayed by the character George Wilson, who suffers from the consequences of aspirations that lead to tragedy.\n\nThe story culminates in a series of tragic events following a hit-and-run accident involving Gatsby's car, which leads to the death of Myrtle Wilson, George Wilson's wife. Tom manipulates George into believing Gatsby was responsible, leading to Gatsby\u2019s demise as George seeks revenge.\n\nIn the end, Gatsby's dream collapses as he is left alone, abandoned by Daisy and ultimately killed by George. The novel concludes with Nick reflecting on Gatsby\u2019s idealism and the elusive nature of the American Dream, indicating that no matter how hard one strives, the past is inescapable and can never be reclaimed.\n\nThe themes of aspiration, love, and the moral decay of society resonate throughout the story, showcasing Fitzgerald's critique of the American Dream and its unattainable nature.",

The room is\nluxuriously and artistically furnished. The sound of a piano is heard\nin the adjoining room.\n\n[Lane is arranging afternoon tea on the table, and after the music has\nceased, Algernon enters.]\n\nALGERNON.\nDid you hear what I was playing, Lane?\n\nLANE.\nI didn\u2019t think it polite to listen, sir.\n\nALGERNON.\nI\u2019m sorry for that, for your sake. I don\u2019t play accurately\u2014any one can\nplay accurately\u2014but I play with wonderful expression. As far as the\npiano is concerned, sentiment is my forte. I keep science for Life.\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir.\n\nALGERNON.\nAnd, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the cucumber\nsandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir. [Hands them on a salver.]\n\nALGERNON.\n[Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the sofa.] Oh! . . . by the\nway, Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night, when Lord\nShoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of\nchampagne are entered as having been consumed.\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.\n\nALGERNON.\nWhy is it that at a bachelor\u2019s establishment the servants invariably\ndrink the champagne? I ask merely for information.\n\nLANE.\nI attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir. I have often\nobserved that in married households the champagne is rarely of a\nfirst-rate brand.\n\nALGERNON.\nGood heavens! Is marriage so demoralising as that?\n\nLANE.\nI believe it _is_ a very pleasant state, sir. I have had very little\nexperience of it myself up to the present. I have only been married\nonce. That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and\na young person.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Languidly_._] I don\u2019t know that I am much interested in your family\nlife, Lane.\n\nLANE.\nNo, sir; it is not a very interesting subject. I never think of it\nmyself.\n\nALGERNON.\nVery natural, I am sure. That will do, Lane, thank you.\n\nLANE.\nThank you, sir. [Lane goes out.]\n\nALGERNON.\nLane\u2019s views on marriage seem somewhat lax. Really, if the lower orders\ndon\u2019t set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them? They\nseem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility.\n\n[Enter Lane.]\n\nLANE.\nMr. Ernest Worthing.\n\n[Enter Jack.]\n\n[Lane goes out_._]\n\nALGERNON.\nHow are you, my dear Ernest? What brings you up to town?\n\nJACK.\nOh, pleasure, pleasure! What else should bring one anywhere? Eating as\nusual, I see, Algy!\n\nALGERNON.\n[Stiffly_._] I believe it is customary in good society to take some\nslight refreshment at five o\u2019clock. Where have you been since last\nThursday?\n\nJACK.\n[Sitting down on the sofa.] In the country.\n\nALGERNON.\nWhat on earth do you do there?\n\nJACK.\n[Pulling off his gloves_._] When one is in town one amuses oneself.\nWhen one is in the country one amuses other people. It is excessively\nboring.\n\nALGERNON.\nAnd who are the people you amuse?\n\nJACK.\n[Airily_._] Oh, neighbours, neighbours.\n\nALGERNON.\nGot nice neighbours in your part of Shropshire?\n\nJACK.\nPerfectly horrid! Never speak to one of them.\n\nALGERNON.\nHow immensely you must amuse them! [Goes over and takes sandwich.] By\nthe way, Shropshire is your county, is it not?\n\nJACK.\nEh? Shropshire? Yes, of course. Hallo! Why all these cups? Why cucumber\nsandwiches? Why such reckless extravagance in one so young? Who is\ncoming to tea?\n\nALGERNON.\nOh! merely Aunt Augusta and Gwendolen.\n\nJACK.\nHow perfectly delightful!\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, that is all very well; but I am afraid Aunt Augusta won\u2019t quite\napprove of your being here.\n\nJACK.\nMay I ask why?\n\nALGERNON.\nMy dear fellow, the way you flirt with Gwendolen is perfectly\ndisgraceful. It is almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with you.\n\nJACK.\nI am in love with Gwendolen. I have come up to town expressly to\npropose to her.\n\nALGERNON.\nI thought you had come up for pleasure? . . . I call that business.\n\nJACK.\nHow utterly unromantic you are!\n\nALGERNON.\nI really don\u2019t see anything romantic in proposing. It is very romantic\nto be in love. But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal.\nWhy, one may be accepted. One usually is, I believe. Then the\nexcitement is all over. The very essence of romance is uncertainty. If\never I get married, I\u2019ll certainly try to forget the fact.\n\nJACK.\nI have no doubt about that, dear Algy. The Divorce Court was specially\ninvented for people whose memories are so curiously constituted.\n\nALGERNON.\nOh! there is no use speculating on that subject. Divorces are made in\nHeaven\u2014[Jack puts out his hand to take a sandwich. Algernon at once\ninterferes.] Please don\u2019t touch the cucumber sandwiches. They are\nordered specially for Aunt Augusta. [Takes one and eats it.]\n\nJACK.\nWell, you have been eating them all the time.\n\nALGERNON.\nThat is quite a different matter. She is my aunt. [Takes plate from\nbelow.] Have some bread and butter. The bread and butter is for\nGwendolen. Gwendolen is devoted to bread and butter.\n\nJACK.\n[Advancing to table and helping himself.] And very good bread and\nbutter it is too.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you were going to eat it\nall. You behave as if you were married to her already. You are not\nmarried to her already, and I don\u2019t think you ever will be.\n\nJACK.\nWhy on earth do you say that?\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt with.\nGirls don\u2019t think it right.\n\nJACK.\nOh, that is nonsense!\n\nALGERNON.\nIt isn\u2019t. It is a great truth. It accounts for the extraordinary number\nof bachelors that one sees all over the place. In the second place, I\ndon\u2019t give my consent.\n\nJACK.\nYour consent!\n\nALGERNON.\nMy dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin. And before I allow you to\nmarry her, you will have to clear up the whole question of Cecily.\n[Rings bell.]\n\nJACK.\nCecily! What on earth do you mean? What do you mean, Algy, by Cecily! I\ndon\u2019t know any one of the name of Cecily.\n\n[Enter Lane.]\n\nALGERNON.\nBring me that cigarette case Mr. Worthing left in the smoking-room the\nlast time he dined here.\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir. [Lane goes out.]\n\nJACK.\nDo you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time? I wish\nto goodness you had let me know. I have been writing frantic letters to\nScotland Yard about it. I was very nearly offering a large reward.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, I wish you would offer one. I happen to be more than usually hard\nup.\n\nJACK.\nThere is no good offering a large reward now that the thing is found.\n\n[Enter Lane with the cigarette case on a salver. Algernon takes it at\nonce. Lane goes out.]\n\nALGERNON.\nI think that is rather mean of you, Ernest, I must say. [Opens case and\nexamines it.] However, it makes no matter, for, now that I look at the\ninscription inside, I find that the thing isn\u2019t yours after all.\n\nJACK.\nOf course it\u2019s mine. [Moving to him.] You have seen me with it a\nhundred times, and you have no right whatsoever to read what is written\ninside. It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette\ncase.\n\nALGERNON.\nOh! it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what one should\nread and what one shouldn\u2019t. More than half of modern culture depends\non what one shouldn\u2019t read.\n\nJACK.\nI am quite aware of the fact, and I don\u2019t propose to discuss modern\nculture. It isn\u2019t the sort of thing one should talk of in private. I\nsimply want my cigarette case back.\n\nALGERNON.\nYes; but this isn\u2019t your cigarette case. This cigarette case is a\npresent from some one of the name of Cecily, and you said you didn\u2019t\nknow any one of that name.\n\nJACK.\nWell, if you want to know, Cecily happens to be my aunt.\n\nALGERNON.\nYour aunt!\n\nJACK.\nYes. Charming old lady she is, too. Lives at Tunbridge Wells. Just give\nit back to me, Algy.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Retreating to back of sofa.] But why does she call herself little\nCecily if she is your aunt and lives at Tunbridge Wells? [Reading.]\n\u2018From little Cecily with her fondest love.\u2019\n\nJACK.\n[Moving to sofa and kneeling upon it.] My dear fellow, what on earth is\nthere in that? Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall. That is a\nmatter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for herself. You\nseem to think that every aunt should be exactly like your aunt! That is\nabsurd! For Heaven\u2019s sake give me back my cigarette case. [Follows\nAlgernon round the room.]\n\nALGERNON.\nYes. But why does your aunt call you her uncle? \u2018From little Cecily,\nwith her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.\u2019 There is no objection, I\nadmit, to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an aunt, no matter what\nher size may be, should call her own nephew her uncle, I can\u2019t quite\nmake out. Besides, your name isn\u2019t Jack at all; it is Ernest.\n\nJACK.\nIt isn\u2019t Ernest; it\u2019s Jack.\n\nALGERNON.\nYou have always told me it was Ernest. I have introduced you to every\none as Ernest. You answer to the name of Ernest. You look as if your\nname was Ernest. You are the most earnest-looking person I ever saw in\nmy life. It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn\u2019t\nErnest. It\u2019s on your cards. Here is one of them. [Taking it from case.]\n\u2018Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany.\u2019 I\u2019ll keep this as a proof that\nyour name is Ernest if ever you attempt to deny it to me, or to\nGwendolen, or to any one else. [Puts the card in his pocket.]\n\nJACK.\nWell, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and the\ncigarette case was given to me in the country.\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, but that does not account for the fact that your small Aunt\nCecily, who lives at Tunbridge Wells, calls you her dear uncle. Come,\nold boy, you had much better have the thing out at once.\n\nJACK.\nMy dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were a dentist. It is very\nvulgar to talk like a dentist when one isn\u2019t a dentist. It produces a\nfalse impression.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, that is exactly what dentists always do. Now, go on! Tell me the\nwhole thing. I may mention that I have always suspected you of being a\nconfirmed and secret Bunburyist; and I am quite sure of it now.\n\nJACK.\nBunburyist? What on earth do you mean by a Bunburyist?\n\nALGERNON.\nI\u2019ll reveal to you the meaning of that incomparable expression as soon\nas you are kind enough to inform me why you are Ernest in town and Jack\nin the country.\n\nJACK.\nWell, produce my cigarette case first.\n\nALGERNON.\nHere it is. [Hands cigarette case.] Now produce your explanation, and\npray make it improbable. [Sits on sofa.]\n\nJACK.\nMy dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about my explanation at\nall. In fact it\u2019s perfectly ordinary. Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who\nadopted me when I was a little boy, made me in his will guardian to his\ngrand-daughter, Miss Cecily Cardew. Cecily, who addresses me as her\nuncle from motives of respect that you could not possibly appreciate,\nlives at my place in the country under the charge of her admirable\ngoverness, Miss Prism.\n\nALGERNON.\nWhere is that place in the country, by the way?\n\nJACK.\nThat is nothing to you, dear boy. You are not going to be invited . . .\nI may tell you candidly that the place is not in Shropshire.\n\nALGERNON.\nI suspected that, my dear fellow! I have Bunburyed all over Shropshire\non two separate occasions. Now, go on. Why are you Ernest in town and\nJack in the country?\n\nJACK.\nMy dear Algy, I don\u2019t know whether you will be able to understand my\nreal motives. You are hardly serious enough. When one is placed in the\nposition of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all\nsubjects. It\u2019s one\u2019s duty to do so. And as a high moral tone can hardly\nbe said to conduce very much to either one\u2019s health or one\u2019s happiness,\nin order to get up to town I have always pretended to have a younger\nbrother of the name of Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets into\nthe most dreadful scrapes. That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure\nand simple.\n\nALGERNON.\nThe truth is rarely pure and never simple. Modern life would be very\ntedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete\nimpossibility!\n\nJACK.\nThat wouldn\u2019t be at all a bad thing.\n\nALGERNON.\nLiterary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow. Don\u2019t try it. You\nshould leave that to people who haven\u2019t been at a University. They do\nit so well in the daily papers. What you really are is a Bunburyist. I\nwas quite right in saying you were a Bunburyist. You are one of the\nmost advanced Bunburyists I know.\n\nJACK.\nWhat on earth do you mean?\n\nALGERNON.\nYou have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest, in order\nthat you may be able to come up to town as often as you like. I have\ninvented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury, in order that\nI may be able to go down into the country whenever I choose. Bunbury is\nperfectly invaluable. If it wasn\u2019t for Bunbury\u2019s extraordinary bad\nhealth, for instance, I wouldn\u2019t be able to dine with you at Willis\u2019s\nto-night, for I have been really engaged to Aunt Augusta for more than\na week.\n\nJACK.\nI haven\u2019t asked you to dine with me anywhere to-night.\n\nALGERNON.\nI know. You are absurdly careless about sending out invitations. It is\nvery foolish of you. Nothing annoys people so much as not receiving\ninvitations.\n\nJACK.\nYou had much better dine with your Aunt Augusta.\n\nALGERNON.\nI haven\u2019t the smallest intention of doing anything of the kind. To\nbegin with, I dined there on Monday, and once a week is quite enough to\ndine with one\u2019s own relations. In the second place, whenever I do dine\nthere I am always treated as a member of the family, and sent down with\neither no woman at all, or two. In the third place, I know perfectly\nwell whom she will place me next to, to-night. She will place me next\nMary Farquhar, who always flirts with her own husband across the\ndinner-table. That is not very pleasant. Indeed, it is not even decent\n. . . and that sort of thing is enormously on the increase. The amount\nof women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly\nscandalous. It looks so bad. It is simply washing one\u2019s clean linen in\npublic. Besides, now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist I\nnaturally want to talk to you about Bunburying. I want to tell you the\nrules.\n\nJACK.\nI\u2019m not a Bunburyist at all. If Gwendolen accepts me, I am going to\nkill my brother, indeed I think I\u2019ll kill him in any case. Cecily is a\nlittle too much interested in him. It is rather a bore. So I am going\nto get rid of Ernest. And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr.\n. . . with your invalid friend who has the absurd name.\n\nALGERNON.\nNothing will induce me to part with Bunbury, and if you ever get\nmarried, which seems to me extremely problematic, you will be very glad\nto know Bunbury. A man who marries without knowing Bunbury has a very\ntedious time of it.\n\nJACK.\nThat is nonsense. If I marry a charming girl like Gwendolen, and she is\nthe only girl I ever saw in my life that I would marry, I certainly\nwon\u2019t want to know Bunbury.\n\nALGERNON.\nThen your wife will. You don\u2019t seem to realise, that in married life\nthree is company and two is none.\n\nJACK.\n[Sententiously.] That, my dear young friend, is the theory that the\ncorrupt French Drama has been propounding for the last fifty years.\n\nALGERNON.\nYes; and that the happy English home has proved in half the time.\n\nJACK.\nFor heaven\u2019s sake, don\u2019t try to be cynical. It\u2019s perfectly easy to be\ncynical.\n\nALGERNON.\nMy dear fellow, it isn\u2019t easy to be anything nowadays. There\u2019s such a\nlot of beastly competition about. [The sound of an electric bell is\nheard.] Ah! that must be Aunt Augusta. Only relatives, or creditors,\never ring in that Wagnerian manner. Now, if I get her out of the way\nfor ten minutes, so that you can have an opportunity for proposing to\nGwendolen, may I dine with you to-night at Willis\u2019s?\n\nJACK.\nI suppose so, if you want to.\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, but you must be serious about it. I hate people who are not\nserious about meals. It is so shallow of them.\n\n[Enter Lane.]\n\nLANE.\nLady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax.\n\n[Algernon goes forward to meet them. Enter Lady Bracknell and\nGwendolen.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nGood afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are behaving very well.\n\nALGERNON.\nI\u2019m feeling very well, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThat\u2019s not quite the same thing. In fact the two things rarely go\ntogether. [Sees Jack and bows to him with icy coldness.]\n\nALGERNON.\n[To Gwendolen.] Dear me, you are smart!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI am always smart! Am I not, Mr. Worthing?\n\nJACK.\nYou\u2019re quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nOh! I hope I am not that. It would leave no room for developments, and\nI intend to develop in many directions. [Gwendolen and Jack sit down\ntogether in the corner.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nI\u2019m sorry if we are a little late, Algernon, but I was obliged to call\non dear Lady Harbury. I hadn\u2019t been there since her poor husband\u2019s\ndeath. I never saw a woman so altered; she looks quite twenty years\nyounger. And now I\u2019ll have a cup of tea, and one of those nice cucumber\nsandwiches you promised me.\n\nALGERNON.\nCertainly, Aunt Augusta. [Goes over to tea-table.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nWon\u2019t you come and sit here, Gwendolen?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThanks, mamma, I\u2019m quite comfortable where I am.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Picking up empty plate in horror.] Good heavens! Lane! Why are there\nno cucumber sandwiches? I ordered them specially.\n\nLANE.\n[Gravely.] There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir. I\nwent down twice.\n\nALGERNON.\nNo cucumbers!\n\nLANE.\nNo, sir. Not even for ready money.\n\nALGERNON.\nThat will do, Lane, thank you.\n\nLANE.\nThank you, sir. [Goes out.]\n\nALGERNON.\nI am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta, about there being no cucumbers,\nnot even for ready money.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nIt really makes no matter, Algernon. I had some crumpets with Lady\nHarbury, who seems to me to be living entirely for pleasure now.\n\nALGERNON.\nI hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nIt certainly has changed its colour. From what cause I, of course,\ncannot say. [Algernon crosses and hands tea.] Thank you. I\u2019ve quite a\ntreat for you to-night, Algernon. I am going to send you down with Mary\nFarquhar. She is such a nice woman, and so attentive to her husband.\nIt\u2019s delightful to watch them.\n\nALGERNON.\nI am afraid, Aunt Augusta, I shall have to give up the pleasure of\ndining with you to-night after all.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Frowning.] I hope not, Algernon. It would put my table completely out.\nYour uncle would have to dine upstairs. Fortunately he is accustomed to\nthat.\n\nALGERNON.\nIt is a great bore, and, I need hardly say, a terrible disappointment\nto me, but the fact is I have just had a telegram to say that my poor\nfriend Bunbury is very ill again. [Exchanges glances with Jack.] They\nseem to think I should be with him.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nIt is very strange. This Mr. Bunbury seems to suffer from curiously bad\nhealth.\n\nALGERNON.\nYes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nWell, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time that Mr.\nBunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die. This\nshilly-shallying with the question is absurd. Nor do I in any way\napprove of the modern sympathy with invalids. I consider it morbid.\nIllness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others.\nHealth is the primary duty of life. I am always telling that to your\npoor uncle, but he never seems to take much notice . . . as far as any\nimprovement in his ailment goes. I should be much obliged if you would\nask Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough not to have a relapse on\nSaturday, for I rely on you to arrange my music for me. It is my last\nreception, and one wants something that will encourage conversation,\nparticularly at the end of the season when every one has practically\nsaid whatever they had to say, which, in most cases, was probably not\nmuch.\n\nALGERNON.\nI\u2019ll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta, if he is still conscious, and I\nthink I can promise you he\u2019ll be all right by Saturday. Of course the\nmusic is a great difficulty. You see, if one plays good music, people\ndon\u2019t listen, and if one plays bad music people don\u2019t talk. But I\u2019ll\nrun over the programme I\u2019ve drawn out, if you will kindly come into the\nnext room for a moment.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThank you, Algernon. It is very thoughtful of you. [Rising, and\nfollowing Algernon.] I\u2019m sure the programme will be delightful, after a\nfew expurgations. French songs I cannot possibly allow. People always\nseem to think that they are improper, and either look shocked, which is\nvulgar, or laugh, which is worse. But German sounds a thoroughly\nrespectable language, and indeed, I believe is so. Gwendolen, you will\naccompany me.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nCertainly, mamma.\n\n[Lady Bracknell and Algernon go into the music-room, Gwendolen remains\nbehind.]\n\nJACK.\nCharming day it has been, Miss Fairfax.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nPray don\u2019t talk to me about the weather, Mr. Worthing. Whenever people\ntalk to me about the weather, I always feel quite certain that they\nmean something else. And that makes me so nervous.\n\nJACK.\nI _do_ mean something else.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI thought so. In fact, I am never wrong.\n\nJACK.\nAnd I would like to be allowed to take advantage of Lady Bracknell\u2019s\ntemporary absence . . .\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI would certainly advise you to do so. Mamma has a way of coming back\nsuddenly into a room that I have often had to speak to her about.\n\nJACK.\n[Nervously.] Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admired you more\nthan any girl . . . I have ever met since . . . I met you.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYes, I am quite well aware of the fact. And I often wish that in\npublic, at any rate, you had been more demonstrative. For me you have\nalways had an irresistible fascination. Even before I met you I was far\nfrom indifferent to you. [Jack looks at her in amazement.] We live, as\nI hope you know, Mr. Worthing, in an age of ideals. The fact is\nconstantly mentioned in the more expensive monthly magazines, and has\nreached the provincial pulpits, I am told; and my ideal has always been\nto love some one of the name of Ernest. There is something in that name\nthat inspires absolute confidence. The moment Algernon first mentioned\nto me that he had a friend called Ernest, I knew I was destined to love\nyou.\n\nJACK.\nYou really love me, Gwendolen?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nPassionately!\n\nJACK.\nDarling! You don\u2019t know how happy you\u2019ve made me.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nMy own Ernest!\n\nJACK.\nBut you don\u2019t really mean to say that you couldn\u2019t love me if my name\nwasn\u2019t Ernest?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nBut your name is Ernest.\n\nJACK.\nYes, I know it is. But supposing it was something else? Do you mean to\nsay you couldn\u2019t love me then?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Glibly.] Ah! that is clearly a metaphysical speculation, and like most\nmetaphysical speculations has very little reference at all to the\nactual facts of real life, as we know them.\n\nJACK.\nPersonally, darling, to speak quite candidly, I don\u2019t much care about\nthe name of Ernest . . . I don\u2019t think the name suits me at all.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nIt suits you perfectly. It is a divine name. It has a music of its own.\nIt produces vibrations.\n\nJACK.\nWell, really, Gwendolen, I must say that I think there are lots of\nother much nicer names. I think Jack, for instance, a charming name.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nJack? . . . No, there is very little music in the name Jack, if any at\nall, indeed. It does not thrill. It produces absolutely no vibrations .\n. . I have known several Jacks, and they all, without exception, were\nmore than usually plain. Besides, Jack is a notorious domesticity for\nJohn! And I pity any woman who is married to a man called John. She\nwould probably never be allowed to know the entrancing pleasure of a\nsingle moment\u2019s solitude. The only really safe name is Ernest.\n\nJACK.\nGwendolen, I must get christened at once\u2014I mean we must get married at\nonce. There is no time to be lost.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nMarried, Mr. Worthing?\n\nJACK.\n[Astounded.] Well . . . surely. You know that I love you, and you led\nme to believe, Miss Fairfax, that you were not absolutely indifferent\nto me.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI adore you. But you haven\u2019t proposed to me yet. Nothing has been said\nat all about marriage. The subject has not even been touched on.\n\nJACK.\nWell . . . may I propose to you now?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI think it would be an admirable opportunity. And to spare you any\npossible disappointment, Mr. Worthing, I think it only fair to tell you\nquite frankly before-hand that I am fully determined to accept you.\n\nJACK.\nGwendolen!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYes, Mr. Worthing, what have you got to say to me?\n\nJACK.\nYou know what I have got to say to you.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYes, but you don\u2019t say it.\n\nJACK.\nGwendolen, will you marry me? [Goes on his knees.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nOf course I will, darling. How long you have been about it! I am afraid\nyou have had very little experience in how to propose.\n\nJACK.\nMy own one, I have never loved any one in the world but you.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYes, but men often propose for practice. I know my brother Gerald does.\nAll my girl-friends tell me so. What wonderfully blue eyes you have,\nErnest! They are quite, quite, blue. I hope you will always look at me\njust like that, especially when there are other people present. [Enter\nLady Bracknell.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nMr. Worthing! Rise, sir, from this semi-recumbent posture. It is most\nindecorous.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nMamma! [He tries to rise; she restrains him.] I must beg you to retire.\nThis is no place for you. Besides, Mr. Worthing has not quite finished\nyet.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nFinished what, may I ask?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI am engaged to Mr. Worthing, mamma. [They rise together.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nPardon me, you are not engaged to any one. When you do become engaged\nto some one, I, or your father, should his health permit him, will\ninform you of the fact. An engagement should come on a young girl as a\nsurprise, pleasant or unpleasant, as the case may be. It is hardly a\nmatter that she could be allowed to arrange for herself . . . And now I\nhave a few questions to put to you, Mr. Worthing. While I am making\nthese inquiries, you, Gwendolen, will wait for me below in the\ncarriage.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Reproachfully.] Mamma!\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nIn the carriage, Gwendolen! [Gwendolen goes to the door. She and Jack\nblow kisses to each other behind Lady Bracknell\u2019s back. Lady Bracknell\nlooks vaguely about as if she could not understand what the noise was.\nFinally turns round.] Gwendolen, the carriage!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYes, mamma. [Goes out, looking back at Jack.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Sitting down.] You can take a seat, Mr. Worthing.\n\n[Looks in her pocket for note-book and pencil.]\n\nJACK.\nThank you, Lady Bracknell, I prefer standing.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Pencil and note-book in hand.] I feel bound to tell you that you are\nnot down on my list of eligible young men, although I have the same\nlist as the dear Duchess of Bolton has. We work together, in fact.\nHowever, I am quite ready to enter your name, should your answers be\nwhat a really affectionate mother requires. Do you smoke?\n\nJACK.\nWell, yes, I must admit I smoke.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nI am glad to hear it. A man should always have an occupation of some\nkind. There are far too many idle men in London as it is. How old are\nyou?\n\nJACK.\nTwenty-nine.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nA very good age to be married at. I have always been of opinion that a\nman who desires to get married should know either everything or\nnothing. Which do you know?\n\nJACK.\n[After some hesitation.] I know nothing, Lady Bracknell.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nI am pleased to hear it. I do not approve of anything that tampers with\nnatural ignorance. Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it\nand the bloom is gone. The whole theory of modern education is\nradically unsound. Fortunately in England, at any rate, education\nproduces no effect whatsoever. If it did, it would prove a serious\ndanger to the upper classes, and probably lead to acts of violence in\nGrosvenor Square. What is your income?\n\nJACK.\nBetween seven and eight thousand a year.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Makes a note in her book.] In land, or in investments?\n\nJACK.\nIn investments, chiefly.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThat is satisfactory. What between the duties expected of one during\none\u2019s lifetime, and the duties exacted from one after one\u2019s death, land\nhas ceased to be either a profit or a pleasure. It gives one position,\nand prevents one from keeping it up. That\u2019s all that can be said about\nland.\n\nJACK.\nI have a country house with some land, of course, attached to it, about\nfifteen hundred acres, I believe; but I don\u2019t depend on that for my\nreal income. In fact, as far as I can make out, the poachers are the\nonly people who make anything out of it.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nA country house! How many bedrooms? Well, that point can be cleared up\nafterwards. You have a town house, I hope? A girl with a simple,\nunspoiled nature, like Gwendolen, could hardly be expected to reside in\nthe country.\n\nJACK.\nWell, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but it is let by the year to\nLady Bloxham. Of course, I can get it back whenever I like, at six\nmonths\u2019 notice.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nLady Bloxham? I don\u2019t know her.\n\nJACK.\nOh, she goes about very little. She is a lady considerably advanced in\nyears.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nAh, nowadays that is no guarantee of respectability of character. What\nnumber in Belgrave Square?\n\nJACK.\n149.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Shaking her head.] The unfashionable side. I thought there was\nsomething. However, that could easily be altered.\n\nJACK.\nDo you mean the fashion, or the side?\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Sternly.] Both, if necessary, I presume. What are your politics?\n\nJACK.\nWell, I am afraid I really have none. I am a Liberal Unionist.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nOh, they count as Tories. They dine with us. Or come in the evening, at\nany rate. Now to minor matters. Are your parents living?\n\nJACK.\nI have lost both my parents.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nTo lose one parent, Mr. Worthing, may be regarded as a misfortune; to\nlose both looks like carelessness. Who was your father? He was\nevidently a man of some wealth. Was he born in what the Radical papers\ncall the purple of commerce, or did he rise from the ranks of the\naristocracy?\n\nJACK.\nI am afraid I really don\u2019t know. The fact is, Lady Bracknell, I said I\nhad lost my parents. It would be nearer the truth to say that my\nparents seem to have lost me . . . I don\u2019t actually know who I am by\nbirth. I was . . . well, I was found.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nFound!\n\nJACK.\nThe late Mr. Thomas Cardew, an old gentleman of a very charitable and\nkindly disposition, found me, and gave me the name of Worthing, because\nhe happened to have a first-class ticket for Worthing in his pocket at\nthe time. Worthing is a place in Sussex. It is a seaside resort.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nWhere did the charitable gentleman who had a first-class ticket for\nthis seaside resort find you?\n\nJACK.\n[Gravely.] In a hand-bag.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nA hand-bag?\n\nJACK.\n[Very seriously.] Yes, Lady Bracknell. I was in a hand-bag\u2014a somewhat\nlarge, black leather hand-bag, with handles to it\u2014an ordinary hand-bag\nin fact.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nIn what locality did this Mr. James, or Thomas, Cardew come across this\nordinary hand-bag?\n\nJACK.\nIn the cloak-room at Victoria Station. It was given to him in mistake\nfor his own.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThe cloak-room at Victoria Station?\n\nJACK.\nYes. The Brighton line.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThe line is immaterial. Mr. Worthing, I confess I feel somewhat\nbewildered by what you have just told me. To be born, or at any rate\nbred, in a hand-bag, whether it had handles or not, seems to me to\ndisplay a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that\nreminds one of the worst excesses of the French Revolution. And I\npresume you know what that unfortunate movement led to? As for the\nparticular locality in which the hand-bag was found, a cloak-room at a\nrailway station might serve to conceal a social indiscretion\u2014has\nprobably, indeed, been used for that purpose before now\u2014but it could\nhardly be regarded as an assured basis for a recognised position in\ngood society.\n\nJACK.\nMay I ask you then what you would advise me to do? I need hardly say I\nwould do anything in the world to ensure Gwendolen\u2019s happiness.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nI would strongly advise you, Mr. Worthing, to try and acquire some\nrelations as soon as possible, and to make a definite effort to produce\nat any rate one parent, of either sex, before the season is quite over.\n\nJACK.\nWell, I don\u2019t see how I could possibly manage to do that. I can produce\nthe hand-bag at any moment. It is in my dressing-room at home. I really\nthink that should satisfy you, Lady Bracknell.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nMe, sir! What has it to do with me? You can hardly imagine that I and\nLord Bracknell would dream of allowing our only daughter\u2014a girl brought\nup with the utmost care\u2014to marry into a cloak-room, and form an\nalliance with a parcel? Good morning, Mr. Worthing!\n\n[Lady Bracknell sweeps out in majestic indignation.]\n\nJACK.\nGood morning! [Algernon, from the other room, strikes up the Wedding\nMarch. Jack looks perfectly furious, and goes to the door.] For\ngoodness\u2019 sake don\u2019t play that ghastly tune, Algy. How idiotic you are!\n\n[The music stops and Algernon enters cheerily.]\n\nALGERNON.\nDidn\u2019t it go off all right, old boy? You don\u2019t mean to say Gwendolen\nrefused you? I know it is a way she has. She is always refusing people.\nI think it is most ill-natured of her.\n\nJACK.\nOh, Gwendolen is as right as a trivet. As far as she is concerned, we\nare engaged. Her mother is perfectly unbearable. Never met such a\nGorgon . . . I don\u2019t really know what a Gorgon is like, but I am quite\nsure that Lady Bracknell is one. In any case, she is a monster, without\nbeing a myth, which is rather unfair . . . I beg your pardon, Algy, I\nsuppose I shouldn\u2019t talk about your own aunt in that way before you.\n\nALGERNON.\nMy dear boy, I love hearing my relations abused. It is the only thing\nthat makes me put up with them at all. Relations are simply a tedious\npack of people, who haven\u2019t got the remotest knowledge of how to live,\nnor the smallest instinct about when to die.\n\nJACK.\nOh, that is nonsense!\n\nALGERNON.\nIt isn\u2019t!\n\nJACK.\nWell, I won\u2019t argue about the matter. You always want to argue about\nthings.\n\nALGERNON.\nThat is exactly what things were originally made for.\n\nJACK.\nUpon my word, if I thought that, I\u2019d shoot myself . . . [A pause.] You\ndon\u2019t think there is any chance of Gwendolen becoming like her mother\nin about a hundred and fifty years, do you, Algy?\n\nALGERNON.\nAll women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man\ndoes. That\u2019s his.\n\nJACK.\nIs that clever?\n\nALGERNON.\nIt is perfectly phrased! and quite as true as any observation in\ncivilised life should be.\n\nJACK.\nI am sick to death of cleverness. Everybody is clever nowadays. You\ncan\u2019t go anywhere without meeting clever people. The thing has become\nan absolute public nuisance. I wish to goodness we had a few fools\nleft.\n\nALGERNON.\nWe have.\n\nJACK.\nI should extremely like to meet them. What do they talk about?\n\nALGERNON.\nThe fools? Oh! about the clever people, of course.\n\nJACK.\nWhat fools!\n\nALGERNON.\nBy the way, did you tell Gwendolen the truth about your being Ernest in\ntown, and Jack in the country?\n\nJACK.\n[In a very patronising manner.] My dear fellow, the truth isn\u2019t quite\nthe sort of thing one tells to a nice, sweet, refined girl. What\nextraordinary ideas you have about the way to behave to a woman!\n\nALGERNON.\nThe only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her, if she is\npretty, and to some one else, if she is plain.\n\nJACK.\nOh, that is nonsense.\n\nALGERNON.\nWhat about your brother? What about the profligate Ernest?\n\nJACK.\nOh, before the end of the week I shall have got rid of him. I\u2019ll say he\ndied in Paris of apoplexy. Lots of people die of apoplexy, quite\nsuddenly, don\u2019t they?\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, but it\u2019s hereditary, my dear fellow. It\u2019s a sort of thing that\nruns in families. You had much better say a severe chill.\n\nJACK.\nYou are sure a severe chill isn\u2019t hereditary, or anything of that kind?\n\nALGERNON.\nOf course it isn\u2019t!\n\nJACK.\nVery well, then. My poor brother Ernest is carried off suddenly, in\nParis, by a severe chill. That gets rid of him.\n\nALGERNON.\nBut I thought you said that . . . Miss Cardew was a little too much\ninterested in your poor brother Ernest? Won\u2019t she feel his loss a good\ndeal?\n\nJACK.\nOh, that is all right. Cecily is not a silly romantic girl, I am glad\nto say. She has got a capital appetite, goes long walks, and pays no\nattention at all to her lessons.\n\nALGERNON.\nI would rather like to see Cecily.\n\nJACK.\nI will take very good care you never do. She is excessively pretty, and\nshe is only just eighteen.\n\nALGERNON.\nHave you told Gwendolen yet that you have an excessively pretty ward\nwho is only just eighteen?\n\nJACK.\nOh! one doesn\u2019t blurt these things out to people. Cecily and Gwendolen\nare perfectly certain to be extremely great friends. I\u2019ll bet you\nanything you like that half an hour after they have met, they will be\ncalling each other sister.\n\nALGERNON.\nWomen only do that when they have called each other a lot of other\nthings first. Now, my dear boy, if we want to get a good table at\nWillis\u2019s, we really must go and dress. Do you know it is nearly seven?\n\nJACK.\n[Irritably.] Oh! It always is nearly seven.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, I\u2019m hungry.\n\nJACK.\nI never knew you when you weren\u2019t . . .\n\nALGERNON.\nWhat shall we do after dinner? Go to a theatre?\n\nJACK.\nOh no! I loathe listening.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, let us go to the Club?\n\nJACK.\nOh, no! I hate talking.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, we might trot round to the Empire at ten?\n\nJACK.\nOh, no! I can\u2019t bear looking at things. It is so silly.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, what shall we do?\n\nJACK.\nNothing!\n\nALGERNON.\nIt is awfully hard work doing nothing. However, I don\u2019t mind hard work\nwhere there is no definite object of any kind.\n\n[Enter Lane.]\n\nLANE.\nMiss Fairfax.\n\n[Enter Gwendolen. Lane goes out.]\n\nALGERNON.\nGwendolen, upon my word!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nAlgy, kindly turn your back. I have something very particular to say to\nMr. Worthing.\n\nALGERNON.\nReally, Gwendolen, I don\u2019t think I can allow this at all.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nAlgy, you always adopt a strictly immoral attitude towards life. You\nare not quite old enough to do that. [Algernon retires to the\nfireplace.]\n\nJACK.\nMy own darling!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nErnest, we may never be married. From the expression on mamma\u2019s face I\nfear we never shall. Few parents nowadays pay any regard to what their\nchildren say to them. The old-fashioned respect for the young is fast\ndying out. Whatever influence I ever had over mamma, I lost at the age\nof three. But although she may prevent us from becoming man and wife,\nand I may marry some one else, and marry often, nothing that she can\npossibly do can alter my eternal devotion to you.\n\nJACK.\nDear Gwendolen!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThe story of your romantic origin, as related to me by mamma, with\nunpleasing comments, has naturally stirred the deeper fibres of my\nnature. Your Christian name has an irresistible fascination. The\nsimplicity of your character makes you exquisitely incomprehensible to\nme. Your town address at the Albany I have. What is your address in the\ncountry?\n\nJACK.\nThe Manor House, Woolton, Hertfordshire.\n\n[Algernon, who has been carefully listening, smiles to himself, and\nwrites the address on his shirt-cuff. Then picks up the Railway Guide.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThere is a good postal service, I suppose? It may be necessary to do\nsomething desperate. That of course will require serious consideration.\nI will communicate with you daily.\n\nJACK.\nMy own one!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nHow long do you remain in town?\n\nJACK.\nTill Monday.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nGood! Algy, you may turn round now.\n\nALGERNON.\nThanks, I\u2019ve turned round already.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYou may also ring the bell.\n\nJACK.\nYou will let me see you to your carriage, my own darling?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nCertainly.\n\nJACK.\n[To Lane, who now enters.] I will see Miss Fairfax out.\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir. [Jack and Gwendolen go off.]\n\n[Lane presents several letters on a salver to Algernon. It is to be\nsurmised that they are bills, as Algernon, after looking at the\nenvelopes, tears them up.]\n\nALGERNON.\nA glass of sherry, Lane.\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir.\n\nALGERNON.\nTo-morrow, Lane, I\u2019m going Bunburying.\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir.\n\nALGERNON.\nI shall probably not be back till Monday. You can put up my dress\nclothes, my smoking jacket, and all the Bunbury suits . . .\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir. [Handing sherry.]\n\nALGERNON.\nI hope to-morrow will be a fine day, Lane.\n\nLANE.\nIt never is, sir.\n\nALGERNON.\nLane, you\u2019re a perfect pessimist.\n\nLANE.\nI do my best to give satisfaction, sir.\n\n[Enter Jack. Lane goes off.]\n\nJACK.\nThere\u2019s a sensible, intellectual girl! the only girl I ever cared for\nin my life. [Algernon is laughing immoderately.] What on earth are you\nso amused at?\n\nALGERNON.\nOh, I\u2019m a little anxious about poor Bunbury, that is all.\n\nJACK.\nIf you don\u2019t take care, your friend Bunbury will get you into a serious\nscrape some day.\n\nALGERNON.\nI love scrapes. They are the only things that are never serious.\n\nJACK.\nOh, that\u2019s nonsense, Algy. You never talk anything but nonsense.\n\nALGERNON.\nNobody ever does.\n\n[Jack looks indignantly at him, and leaves the room. Algernon lights a\ncigarette, reads his shirt-cuff, and smiles.]\n\nACT DROP\n\n\n\n\nSECOND ACT\n\n\nSCENE\n\nGarden at the Manor House. A flight of grey stone steps leads up to the\nhouse. The garden, an old-fashioned one, full of roses. Time of year,\nJuly. Basket chairs, and a table covered with books, are set under a\nlarge yew-tree.\n\n[Miss Prism discovered seated at the table. Cecily is at the back\nwatering flowers.]\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Calling.] Cecily, Cecily! Surely such a utilitarian occupation as the\nwatering of flowers is rather Moulton\u2019s duty than yours? Especially at\na moment when intellectual pleasures await you. Your German grammar is\non the table. Pray open it at page fifteen. We will repeat yesterday\u2019s\nlesson.\n\nCECILY.\n[Coming over very slowly.] But I don\u2019t like German. It isn\u2019t at all a\nbecoming language. I know perfectly well that I look quite plain after\nmy German lesson.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nChild, you know how anxious your guardian is that you should improve\nyourself in every way. He laid particular stress on your German, as he\nwas leaving for town yesterday. Indeed, he always lays stress on your\nGerman when he is leaving for town.\n\nCECILY.\nDear Uncle Jack is so very serious! Sometimes he is so serious that I\nthink he cannot be quite well.\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Drawing herself up.] Your guardian enjoys the best of health, and his\ngravity of demeanour is especially to be commended in one so\ncomparatively young as he is. I know no one who has a higher sense of\nduty and responsibility.\n\nCECILY.\nI suppose that is why he often looks a little bored when we three are\ntogether.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nCecily! I am surprised at you. Mr. Worthing has many troubles in his\nlife. Idle merriment and triviality would be out of place in his\nconversation. You must remember his constant anxiety about that\nunfortunate young man his brother.\n\nCECILY.\nI wish Uncle Jack would allow that unfortunate young man, his brother,\nto come down here sometimes. We might have a good influence over him,\nMiss Prism. I am sure you certainly would. You know German, and\ngeology, and things of that kind influence a man very much. [Cecily\nbegins to write in her diary.]\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Shaking her head.] I do not think that even I could produce any effect\non a character that according to his own brother\u2019s admission is\nirretrievably weak and vacillating. Indeed I am not sure that I would\ndesire to reclaim him. I am not in favour of this modern mania for\nturning bad people into good people at a moment\u2019s notice. As a man sows\nso let him reap. You must put away your diary, Cecily. I really don\u2019t\nsee why you should keep a diary at all.\n\nCECILY.\nI keep a diary in order to enter the wonderful secrets of my life. If I\ndidn\u2019t write them down, I should probably forget all about them.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nMemory, my dear Cecily, is the diary that we all carry about with us.\n\nCECILY.\nYes, but it usually chronicles the things that have never happened, and\ncouldn\u2019t possibly have happened. I believe that Memory is responsible\nfor nearly all the three-volume novels that Mudie sends us.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nDo not speak slightingly of the three-volume novel, Cecily. I wrote one\nmyself in earlier days.\n\nCECILY.\nDid you really, Miss Prism? How wonderfully clever you are! I hope it\ndid not end happily? I don\u2019t like novels that end happily. They depress\nme so much.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nThe good ended happily, and the bad unhappily. That is what Fiction\nmeans.\n\nCECILY.\nI suppose so. But it seems very unfair. And was your novel ever\npublished?\n\nMISS PRISM.\nAlas! no. The manuscript unfortunately was abandoned. [Cecily starts.]\nI use the word in the sense of lost or mislaid. To your work, child,\nthese speculations are profitless.\n\nCECILY.\n[Smiling.] But I see dear Dr. Chasuble coming up through the garden.\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Rising and advancing.] Dr. Chasuble! This is indeed a pleasure.\n\n[Enter Canon Chasuble.]\n\nCHASUBLE.\nAnd how are we this morning? Miss Prism, you are, I trust, well?\n\nCECILY.\nMiss Prism has just been complaining of a slight headache. I think it\nwould do her so much good to have a short stroll with you in the Park,\nDr. Chasuble.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nCecily, I have not mentioned anything about a headache.\n\nCECILY.\nNo, dear Miss Prism, I know that, but I felt instinctively that you had\na headache. Indeed I was thinking about that, and not about my German\nlesson, when the Rector came in.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nI hope, Cecily, you are not inattentive.\n\nCECILY.\nOh, I am afraid I am.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nThat is strange. Were I fortunate enough to be Miss Prism\u2019s pupil, I\nwould hang upon her lips. [Miss Prism glares.] I spoke\nmetaphorically.\u2014My metaphor was drawn from bees. Ahem! Mr. Worthing, I\nsuppose, has not returned from town yet?\n\nMISS PRISM.\nWe do not expect him till Monday afternoon.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nAh yes, he usually likes to spend his Sunday in London. He is not one\nof those whose sole aim is enjoyment, as, by all accounts, that\nunfortunate young man his brother seems to be. But I must not disturb\nEgeria and her pupil any longer.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nEgeria? My name is L\u00e6titia, Doctor.\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[Bowing.] A classical allusion merely, drawn from the Pagan authors. I\nshall see you both no doubt at Evensong?\n\nMISS PRISM.\nI think, dear Doctor, I will have a stroll with you. I find I have a\nheadache after all, and a walk might do it good.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nWith pleasure, Miss Prism, with pleasure. We might go as far as the\nschools and back.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nThat would be delightful. Cecily, you will read your Political Economy\nin my absence. The chapter on the Fall of the Rupee you may omit. It is\nsomewhat too sensational. Even these metallic problems have their\nmelodramatic side.\n\n[Goes down the garden with Dr. Chasuble.]\n\nCECILY.\n[Picks up books and throws them back on table.] Horrid Political\nEconomy! Horrid Geography! Horrid, horrid German!\n\n[Enter Merriman with a card on a salver.]\n\nMERRIMAN.\nMr. Ernest Worthing has just driven over from the station. He has\nbrought his luggage with him.\n\nCECILY.\n[Takes the card and reads it.] \u2018Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany,\nW.\u2019 Uncle Jack\u2019s brother! Did you tell him Mr. Worthing was in town?\n\nMERRIMAN.\nYes, Miss. He seemed very much disappointed. I mentioned that you and\nMiss Prism were in the garden. He said he was anxious to speak to you\nprivately for a moment.\n\nCECILY.\nAsk Mr. Ernest Worthing to come here. I suppose you had better talk to\nthe housekeeper about a room for him.\n\nMERRIMAN.\nYes, Miss.\n\n[Merriman goes off.]\n\nCECILY.\nI have never met any really wicked person before. I feel rather\nfrightened. I am so afraid he will look just like every one else.\n\n[Enter Algernon, very gay and debonnair.] He does!\n\nALGERNON.\n[Raising his hat.] You are my little cousin Cecily, I\u2019m sure.\n\nCECILY.\nYou are under some strange mistake. I am not little. In fact, I believe\nI am more than usually tall for my age. [Algernon is rather taken\naback.] But I am your cousin Cecily. You, I see from your card, are\nUncle Jack\u2019s brother, my cousin Ernest, my wicked cousin Ernest.\n\nALGERNON.\nOh! I am not really wicked at all, cousin Cecily. You mustn\u2019t think\nthat I am wicked.\n\nCECILY.\nIf you are not, then you have certainly been deceiving us all in a very\ninexcusable manner. I hope you have not been leading a double life,\npretending to be wicked and being really good all the time. That would\nbe hypocrisy.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Looks at her in amazement.] Oh! Of course I have been rather reckless.\n\nCECILY.\nI am glad to hear it.\n\nALGERNON.\nIn fact, now you mention the subject, I have been very bad in my own\nsmall way.\n\nCECILY.\nI don\u2019t think you should be so proud of that, though I am sure it must\nhave been very pleasant.\n\nALGERNON.\nIt is much pleasanter being here with you.\n\nCECILY.\nI can\u2019t understand how you are here at all. Uncle Jack won\u2019t be back\ntill Monday afternoon.\n\nALGERNON.\nThat is a great disappointment. I am obliged to go up by the first\ntrain on Monday morning. I have a business appointment that I am\nanxious . . . to miss?\n\nCECILY.\nCouldn\u2019t you miss it anywhere but in London?\n\nALGERNON.\nNo: the appointment is in London.\n\nCECILY.\nWell, I know, of course, how important it is not to keep a business\nengagement, if one wants to retain any sense of the beauty of life, but\nstill I think you had better wait till Uncle Jack arrives. I know he\nwants to speak to you about your emigrating.\n\nALGERNON.\nAbout my what?\n\nCECILY.\nYour emigrating. He has gone up to buy your outfit.\n\nALGERNON.\nI certainly wouldn\u2019t let Jack buy my outfit. He has no taste in\nneckties at all.\n\nCECILY.\nI don\u2019t think you will require neckties. Uncle Jack is sending you to\nAustralia.\n\nALGERNON.\nAustralia! I\u2019d sooner die.\n\nCECILY.\nWell, he said at dinner on Wednesday night, that you would have to\nchoose between this world, the next world, and Australia.\n\nALGERNON.\nOh, well! The accounts I have received of Australia and the next world,\nare not particularly encouraging. This world is good enough for me,\ncousin Cecily.\n\nCECILY.\nYes, but are you good enough for it?\n\nALGERNON.\nI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not that. That is why I want you to reform me. You might\nmake that your mission, if you don\u2019t mind, cousin Cecily.\n\nCECILY.\nI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve no time, this afternoon.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, would you mind my reforming myself this afternoon?\n\nCECILY.\nIt is rather Quixotic of you. But I think you should try.\n\nALGERNON.\nI will. I feel better already.\n\nCECILY.\nYou are looking a little worse.\n\nALGERNON.\nThat is because I am hungry.\n\nCECILY.\nHow thoughtless of me. I should have remembered that when one is going\nto lead an entirely new life, one requires regular and wholesome meals.\nWon\u2019t you come in?\n\nALGERNON.\nThank you. Might I have a buttonhole first? I never have any appetite\nunless I have a buttonhole first.\n\nCECILY.\nA Marechal Niel? [Picks up scissors.]\n\nALGERNON.\nNo, I\u2019d sooner have a pink rose.\n\nCECILY.\nWhy? [Cuts a flower.]\n\nALGERNON.\nBecause you are like a pink rose, Cousin Cecily.\n\nCECILY.\nI don\u2019t think it can be right for you to talk to me like that. Miss\nPrism never says such things to me.\n\nALGERNON.\nThen Miss Prism is a short-sighted old lady. [Cecily puts the rose in\nhis buttonhole.] You are the prettiest girl I ever saw.\n\nCECILY.\nMiss Prism says that all good looks are a snare.\n\nALGERNON.\nThey are a snare that every sensible man would like to be caught in.\n\nCECILY.\nOh, I don\u2019t think I would care to catch a sensible man. I shouldn\u2019t\nknow what to talk to him about.\n\n[They pass into the house. Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble return.]\n\nMISS PRISM.\nYou are too much alone, dear Dr. Chasuble. You should get married. A\nmisanthrope I can understand\u2014a womanthrope, never!\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[With a scholar\u2019s shudder.] Believe me, I do not deserve so neologistic\na phrase. The precept as well as the practice of the Primitive Church\nwas distinctly against matrimony.\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Sententiously.] That is obviously the reason why the Primitive Church\nhas not lasted up to the present day. And you do not seem to realise,\ndear Doctor, that by persistently remaining single, a man converts\nhimself into a permanent public temptation. Men should be more careful;\nthis very celibacy leads weaker vessels astray.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nBut is a man not equally attractive when married?\n\nMISS PRISM.\nNo married man is ever attractive except to his wife.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nAnd often, I\u2019ve been told, not even to her.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nThat depends on the intellectual sympathies of the woman. Maturity can\nalways be depended on. Ripeness can be trusted. Young women are green.\n[Dr. Chasuble starts.] I spoke horticulturally. My metaphor was drawn\nfrom fruits. But where is Cecily?\n\nCHASUBLE.\nPerhaps she followed us to the schools.\n\n[Enter Jack slowly from the back of the garden. He is dressed in the\ndeepest mourning, with crape hatband and black gloves.]\n\nMISS PRISM.\nMr. Worthing!\n\nCHASUBLE.\nMr. Worthing?\n\nMISS PRISM.\nThis is indeed a surprise. We did not look for you till Monday\nafternoon.\n\nJACK.\n[Shakes Miss Prism\u2019s hand in a tragic manner.] I have returned sooner\nthan I expected. Dr. Chasuble, I hope you are well?\n\nCHASUBLE.\nDear Mr. Worthing, I trust this garb of woe does not betoken some\nterrible calamity?\n\nJACK.\nMy brother.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nMore shameful debts and extravagance?\n\nCHASUBLE.\nStill leading his life of pleasure?\n\nJACK.\n[Shaking his head.] Dead!\n\nCHASUBLE.\nYour brother Ernest dead?\n\nJACK.\nQuite dead.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nWhat a lesson for him! I trust he will profit by it.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nMr. Worthing, I offer you my sincere condolence. You have at least the\nconsolation of knowing that you were always the most generous and\nforgiving of brothers.\n\nJACK.\nPoor Ernest! He had many faults, but it is a sad, sad blow.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nVery sad indeed. Were you with him at the end?\n\nJACK.\nNo. He died abroad; in Paris, in fact. I had a telegram last night from\nthe manager of the Grand Hotel.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nWas the cause of death mentioned?\n\nJACK.\nA severe chill, it seems.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nAs a man sows, so shall he reap.\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[Raising his hand.] Charity, dear Miss Prism, charity! None of us are\nperfect. I myself am peculiarly susceptible to draughts. Will the\ninterment take place here?\n\nJACK.\nNo. He seems to have expressed a desire to be buried in Paris.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nIn Paris! [Shakes his head.] I fear that hardly points to any very\nserious state of mind at the last. You would no doubt wish me to make\nsome slight allusion to this tragic domestic affliction next Sunday.\n[Jack presses his hand convulsively.] My sermon on the meaning of the\nmanna in the wilderness can be adapted to almost any occasion, joyful,\nor, as in the present case, distressing. [All sigh.] I have preached it\nat harvest celebrations, christenings, confirmations, on days of\nhumiliation and festal days. The last time I delivered it was in the\nCathedral, as a charity sermon on behalf of the Society for the\nPrevention of Discontent among the Upper Orders. The Bishop, who was\npresent, was much struck by some of the analogies I drew.\n\nJACK.\nAh! that reminds me, you mentioned christenings I think, Dr. Chasuble?\nI suppose you know how to christen all right? [Dr. Chasuble looks\nastounded.] I mean, of course, you are continually christening, aren\u2019t\nyou?\n\nMISS PRISM.\nIt is, I regret to say, one of the Rector\u2019s most constant duties in\nthis parish. I have often spoken to the poorer classes on the subject.\nBut they don\u2019t seem to know what thrift is.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nBut is there any particular infant in whom you are interested, Mr.\nWorthing? Your brother was, I believe, unmarried, was he not?\n\nJACK.\nOh yes.\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Bitterly.] People who live entirely for pleasure usually are.\n\nJACK.\nBut it is not for any child, dear Doctor. I am very fond of children.\nNo! the fact is, I would like to be christened myself, this afternoon,\nif you have nothing better to do.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nBut surely, Mr. Worthing, you have been christened already?\n\nJACK.\nI don\u2019t remember anything about it.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nBut have you any grave doubts on the subject?\n\nJACK.\nI certainly intend to have. Of course I don\u2019t know if the thing would\nbother you in any way, or if you think I am a little too old now.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nNot at all. The sprinkling, and, indeed, the immersion of adults is a\nperfectly canonical practice.\n\nJACK.\nImmersion!\n\nCHASUBLE.\nYou need have no apprehensions. Sprinkling is all that is necessary, or\nindeed I think advisable. Our weather is so changeable. At what hour\nwould you wish the ceremony performed?\n\nJACK.\nOh, I might trot round about five if that would suit you.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nPerfectly, perfectly! In fact I have two similar ceremonies to perform\nat that time. A case of twins that occurred recently in one of the\noutlying cottages on your own estate. Poor Jenkins the carter, a most\nhard-working man.\n\nJACK.\nOh! I don\u2019t see much fun in being christened along with other babies.\nIt would be childish. Would half-past five do?\n\nCHASUBLE.\nAdmirably! Admirably! [Takes out watch.] And now, dear Mr. Worthing, I\nwill not intrude any longer into a house of sorrow. I would merely beg\nyou not to be too much bowed down by grief. What seem to us bitter\ntrials are often blessings in disguise.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nThis seems to me a blessing of an extremely obvious kind.\n\n[Enter Cecily from the house.]\n\nCECILY.\nUncle Jack! Oh, I am pleased to see you back. But what horrid clothes\nyou have got on! Do go and change them.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nCecily!\n\nCHASUBLE.\nMy child! my child! [Cecily goes towards Jack; he kisses her brow in a\nmelancholy manner.]\n\nCECILY.\nWhat is the matter, Uncle Jack? Do look happy! You look as if you had\ntoothache, and I have got such a surprise for you. Who do you think is\nin the dining-room? Your brother!\n\nJACK.\nWho?\n\nCECILY.\nYour brother Ernest. He arrived about half an hour ago.\n\nJACK.\nWhat nonsense! I haven\u2019t got a brother.\n\nCECILY.\nOh, don\u2019t say that. However badly he may have behaved to you in the\npast he is still your brother. You couldn\u2019t be so heartless as to\ndisown him. I\u2019ll tell him to come out. And you will shake hands with\nhim, won\u2019t you, Uncle Jack? [Runs back into the house.]\n\nCHASUBLE.\nThese are very joyful tidings.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nAfter we had all been resigned to his loss, his sudden return seems to\nme peculiarly distressing.\n\nJACK.\nMy brother is in the dining-room? I don\u2019t know what it all means. I\nthink it is perfectly absurd.\n\n[Enter Algernon and Cecily hand in hand. They come slowly up to Jack.]\n\nJACK.\nGood heavens! [Motions Algernon away.]\n\nALGERNON.\nBrother John, I have come down from town to tell you that I am very\nsorry for all the trouble I have given you, and that I intend to lead a\nbetter life in the future. [Jack glares at him and does not take his\nhand.]\n\nCECILY.\nUncle Jack, you are not going to refuse your own brother\u2019s hand?\n\nJACK.\nNothing will induce me to take his hand. I think his coming down here\ndisgraceful. He knows perfectly well why.\n\nCECILY.\nUncle Jack, do be nice. There is some good in every one. Ernest has\njust been telling me about his poor invalid friend Mr. Bunbury whom he\ngoes to visit so often. And surely there must be much good in one who\nis kind to an invalid, and leaves the pleasures of London to sit by a\nbed of pain.\n\nJACK.\nOh! he has been talking about Bunbury, has he?\n\nCECILY.\nYes, he has told me all about poor Mr. Bunbury, and his terrible state\nof health.\n\nJACK.\nBunbury! Well, I won\u2019t have him talk to you about Bunbury or about\nanything else. It is enough to drive one perfectly frantic.\n\nALGERNON.\nOf course I admit that the faults were all on my side. But I must say\nthat I think that Brother John\u2019s coldness to me is peculiarly painful.\nI expected a more enthusiastic welcome, especially considering it is\nthe first time I have come here.\n\nCECILY.\nUncle Jack, if you don\u2019t shake hands with Ernest I will never forgive\nyou.\n\nJACK.\nNever forgive me?\n\nCECILY.\nNever, never, never!\n\nJACK.\nWell, this is the last time I shall ever do it. [Shakes with Algernon\nand glares.]\n\nCHASUBLE.\nIt\u2019s pleasant, is it not, to see so perfect a reconciliation? I think\nwe might leave the two brothers together.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nCecily, you will come with us.\n\nCECILY.\nCertainly, Miss Prism. My little task of reconciliation is over.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nYou have done a beautiful action to-day, dear child.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nWe must not be premature in our judgments.\n\nCECILY.\nI feel very happy. [They all go off except Jack and Algernon.]\n\nJACK.\nYou young scoundrel, Algy, you must get out of this place as soon as\npossible. I don\u2019t allow any Bunburying here.\n\n[Enter Merriman.]\n\nMERRIMAN.\nI have put Mr. Ernest\u2019s things in the room next to yours, sir. I\nsuppose that is all right?\n\nJACK.\nWhat?\n\nMERRIMAN.\nMr. Ernest\u2019s luggage, sir. I have unpacked it and put it in the room\nnext to your own.\n\nJACK.\nHis luggage?\n\nMERRIMAN.\nYes, sir. Three portmanteaus, a dressing-case, two hat-boxes, and a\nlarge luncheon-basket.\n\nALGERNON.\nI am afraid I can\u2019t stay more than a week this time.\n\nJACK.\nMerriman, order the dog-cart at once. Mr. Ernest has been suddenly\ncalled back to town.\n\nMERRIMAN.\nYes, sir. [Goes back into the house.]\n\nALGERNON.\nWhat a fearful liar you are, Jack. I have not been called back to town\nat all.\n\nJACK.\nYes, you have.\n\nALGERNON.\nI haven\u2019t heard any one call me.\n\nJACK.\nYour duty as a gentleman calls you back.\n\nALGERNON.\nMy duty as a gentleman has never interfered with my pleasures in the\nsmallest degree.\n\nJACK.\nI can quite understand that.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, Cecily is a darling.\n\nJACK.\nYou are not to talk of Miss Cardew like that. I don\u2019t like it.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, I don\u2019t like your clothes. You look perfectly ridiculous in them.\nWhy on earth don\u2019t you go up and change? It is perfectly childish to be\nin deep mourning for a man who is actually staying for a whole week\nwith you in your house as a guest. I call it grotesque.\n\nJACK.\nYou are certainly not staying with me for a whole week as a guest or\nanything else. You have got to leave . . . by the four-five train.\n\nALGERNON.\nI certainly won\u2019t leave you so long as you are in mourning. It would be\nmost unfriendly. If I were in mourning you would stay with me, I\nsuppose. I should think it very unkind if you didn\u2019t.\n\nJACK.\nWell, will you go if I change my clothes?\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, if you are not too long. I never saw anybody take so long to\ndress, and with such little result.\n\nJACK.\nWell, at any rate, that is better than being always over-dressed as you\nare.\n\nALGERNON.\nIf I am occasionally a little over-dressed, I make up for it by being\nalways immensely over-educated.\n\nJACK.\nYour vanity is ridiculous, your conduct an outrage, and your presence\nin my garden utterly absurd. However, you have got to catch the\nfour-five, and I hope you will have a pleasant journey back to town.\nThis Bunburying, as you call it, has not been a great success for you.\n\n[Goes into the house.]\n\nALGERNON.\nI think it has been a great success. I\u2019m in love with Cecily, and that\nis everything.\n\n[Enter Cecily at the back of the garden. She picks up the can and\nbegins to water the flowers.] But I must see her before I go, and make\narrangements for another Bunbury. Ah, there she is.\n\nCECILY.\nOh, I merely came back to water the roses. I thought you were with\nUncle Jack.\n\nALGERNON.\nHe\u2019s gone to order the dog-cart for me.\n\nCECILY.\nOh, is he going to take you for a nice drive?\n\nALGERNON.\nHe\u2019s going to send me away.\n\nCECILY.\nThen have we got to part?\n\nALGERNON.\nI am afraid so. It\u2019s a very painful parting.\n\nCECILY.\nIt is always painful to part from people whom one has known for a very\nbrief space of time. The absence of old friends one can endure with\nequanimity. But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has\njust been introduced is almost unbearable.\n\nALGERNON.\nThank you.\n\n[Enter Merriman.]\n\nMERRIMAN.\nThe dog-cart is at the door, sir. [Algernon looks appealingly at\nCecily.]\n\nCECILY.\nIt can wait, Merriman for . . . five minutes.\n\nMERRIMAN.\nYes, Miss. [Exit Merriman.]\n\nALGERNON.\nI hope, Cecily, I shall not offend you if I state quite frankly and\nopenly that you seem to me to be in every way the visible\npersonification of absolute perfection.\n\nCECILY.\nI think your frankness does you great credit, Ernest. If you will allow\nme, I will copy your remarks into my diary. [Goes over to table and\nbegins writing in diary.]\n\nALGERNON.\nDo you really keep a diary? I\u2019d give anything to look at it. May I?\n\nCECILY.\nOh no. [Puts her hand over it.] You see, it is simply a very young\ngirl\u2019s record of her own thoughts and impressions, and consequently\nmeant for publication. When it appears in volume form I hope you will\norder a copy. But pray, Ernest, don\u2019t stop. I delight in taking down\nfrom dictation. I have reached \u2018absolute perfection\u2019. You can go on. I\nam quite ready for more.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Somewhat taken aback.] Ahem! Ahem!\n\nCECILY.\nOh, don\u2019t cough, Ernest. When one is dictating one should speak\nfluently and not cough. Besides, I don\u2019t know how to spell a cough.\n[Writes as Algernon speaks.]\n\nALGERNON.\n[Speaking very rapidly.] Cecily, ever since I first looked upon your\nwonderful and incomparable beauty, I have dared to love you wildly,\npassionately, devotedly, hopelessly.\n\nCECILY.\nI don\u2019t think that you should tell me that you love me wildly,\npassionately, devotedly, hopelessly. Hopelessly doesn\u2019t seem to make\nmuch sense, does it?\n\nALGERNON.\nCecily!\n\n[Enter Merriman.]\n\nMERRIMAN.\nThe dog-cart is waiting, sir.\n\nALGERNON.\nTell it to come round next week, at the same hour.\n\nMERRIMAN.\n[Looks at Cecily, who makes no sign.] Yes, sir.\n\n[Merriman retires.]\n\nCECILY.\nUncle Jack would be very much annoyed if he knew you were staying on\ntill next week, at the same hour.\n\nALGERNON.\nOh, I don\u2019t care about Jack. I don\u2019t care for anybody in the whole\nworld but you. I love you, Cecily. You will marry me, won\u2019t you?\n\nCECILY.\nYou silly boy! Of course. Why, we have been engaged for the last three\nmonths.\n\nALGERNON.\nFor the last three months?\n\nCECILY.\nYes, it will be exactly three months on Thursday.\n\nALGERNON.\nBut how did we become engaged?\n\nCECILY.\nWell, ever since dear Uncle Jack first confessed to us that he had a\nyounger brother who was very wicked and bad, you of course have formed\nthe chief topic of conversation between myself and Miss Prism. And of\ncourse a man who is much talked about is always very attractive. One\nfeels there must be something in him, after all. I daresay it was\nfoolish of me, but I fell in love with you, Ernest.\n\nALGERNON.\nDarling! And when was the engagement actually settled?\n\nCECILY.\nOn the 14th of February last. Worn out by your entire ignorance of my\nexistence, I determined to end the matter one way or the other, and\nafter a long struggle with myself I accepted you under this dear old\ntree here. The next day I bought this little ring in your name, and\nthis is the little bangle with the true lover\u2019s knot I promised you\nalways to wear.\n\nALGERNON.\nDid I give you this? It\u2019s very pretty, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCECILY.\nYes, you\u2019ve wonderfully good taste, Ernest. It\u2019s the excuse I\u2019ve always\ngiven for your leading such a bad life. And this is the box in which I\nkeep all your dear letters. [Kneels at table, opens box, and produces\nletters tied up with blue ribbon.]\n\nALGERNON.\nMy letters! But, my own sweet Cecily, I have never written you any\nletters.\n\nCECILY.\nYou need hardly remind me of that, Ernest. I remember only too well\nthat I was forced to write your letters for you. I wrote always three\ntimes a week, and sometimes oftener.\n\nALGERNON.\nOh, do let me read them, Cecily?\n\nCECILY.\nOh, I couldn\u2019t possibly. They would make you far too conceited.\n[Replaces box.] The three you wrote me after I had broken off the\nengagement are so beautiful, and so badly spelled, that even now I can\nhardly read them without crying a little.\n\nALGERNON.\nBut was our engagement ever broken off?\n\nCECILY.\nOf course it was. On the 22nd of last March. You can see the entry if\nyou like. [Shows diary.] \u2018To-day I broke off my engagement with Ernest.\nI feel it is better to do so. The weather still continues charming.\u2019\n\nALGERNON.\nBut why on earth did you break it off? What had I done? I had done\nnothing at all. Cecily, I am very much hurt indeed to hear you broke it\noff. Particularly when the weather was so charming.\n\nCECILY.\nIt would hardly have been a really serious engagement if it hadn\u2019t been\nbroken off at least once. But I forgave you before the week was out.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Crossing to her, and kneeling.] What a perfect angel you are, Cecily.\n\nCECILY.\nYou dear romantic boy. [He kisses her, she puts her fingers through his\nhair.] I hope your hair curls naturally, does it?\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, darling, with a little help from others.\n\nCECILY.\nI am so glad.\n\nALGERNON.\nYou\u2019ll never break off our engagement again, Cecily?\n\nCECILY.\nI don\u2019t think I could break it off now that I have actually met you.\nBesides, of course, there is the question of your name.\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, of course. [Nervously.]\n\nCECILY.\nYou must not laugh at me, darling, but it had always been a girlish\ndream of mine to love some one whose name was Ernest. [Algernon rises,\nCecily also.] There is something in that name that seems to inspire\nabsolute confidence. I pity any poor married woman whose husband is not\ncalled Ernest.\n\nALGERNON.\nBut, my dear child, do you mean to say you could not love me if I had\nsome other name?\n\nCECILY.\nBut what name?\n\nALGERNON.\nOh, any name you like\u2014Algernon\u2014for instance . . .\n\nCECILY.\nBut I don\u2019t like the name of Algernon.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, my own dear, sweet, loving little darling, I really can\u2019t see why\nyou should object to the name of Algernon. It is not at all a bad name.\nIn fact, it is rather an aristocratic name. Half of the chaps who get\ninto the Bankruptcy Court are called Algernon. But seriously, Cecily .\n. . [Moving to her] . . . if my name was Algy, couldn\u2019t you love me?\n\nCECILY.\n[Rising.] I might respect you, Ernest, I might admire your character,\nbut I fear that I should not be able to give you my undivided\nattention.\n\nALGERNON.\nAhem! Cecily! [Picking up hat.] Your Rector here is, I suppose,\nthoroughly experienced in the practice of all the rites and ceremonials\nof the Church?\n\nCECILY.\nOh, yes. Dr. Chasuble is a most learned man. He has never written a\nsingle book, so you can imagine how much he knows.\n\nALGERNON.\nI must see him at once on a most important christening\u2014I mean on most\nimportant business.\n\nCECILY.\nOh!\n\nALGERNON.\nI shan\u2019t be away more than half an hour.\n\nCECILY.\nConsidering that we have been engaged since February the 14th, and that\nI only met you to-day for the first time, I think it is rather hard\nthat you should leave me for so long a period as half an hour. Couldn\u2019t\nyou make it twenty minutes?\n\nALGERNON.\nI\u2019ll be back in no time.\n\n[Kisses her and rushes down the garden.]\n\nCECILY.\nWhat an impetuous boy he is! I like his hair so much. I must enter his\nproposal in my diary.\n\n[Enter Merriman.]\n\nMERRIMAN.\nA Miss Fairfax has just called to see Mr. Worthing. On very important\nbusiness, Miss Fairfax states.\n\nCECILY.\nIsn\u2019t Mr. Worthing in his library?\n\nMERRIMAN.\nMr. Worthing went over in the direction of the Rectory some time ago.\n\nCECILY.\nPray ask the lady to come out here; Mr. Worthing is sure to be back\nsoon. And you can bring tea.\n\nMERRIMAN.\nYes, Miss. [Goes out.]\n\nCECILY.\nMiss Fairfax! I suppose one of the many good elderly women who are\nassociated with Uncle Jack in some of his philanthropic work in London.\nI don\u2019t quite like women who are interested in philanthropic work. I\nthink it is so forward of them.\n\n[Enter Merriman.]\n\nMERRIMAN.\nMiss Fairfax.\n\n[Enter Gwendolen.]\n\n[Exit Merriman.]\n\nCECILY.\n[Advancing to meet her.] Pray let me introduce myself to you. My name\nis Cecily Cardew.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nCecily Cardew? [Moving to her and shaking hands.] What a very sweet\nname! Something tells me that we are going to be great friends. I like\nyou already more than I can say. My first impressions of people are\nnever wrong.\n\nCECILY.\nHow nice of you to like me so much after we have known each other such\na comparatively short time. Pray sit down.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Still standing up.] I may call you Cecily, may I not?\n\nCECILY.\nWith pleasure!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nAnd you will always call me Gwendolen, won\u2019t you?\n\nCECILY.\nIf you wish.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThen that is all quite settled, is it not?\n\nCECILY.\nI hope so. [A pause. They both sit down together.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nPerhaps this might be a favourable opportunity for my mentioning who I\nam. My father is Lord Bracknell. You have never heard of papa, I\nsuppose?\n\nCECILY.\nI don\u2019t think so.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nOutside the family circle, papa, I am glad to say, is entirely unknown.\nI think that is quite as it should be. The home seems to me to be the\nproper sphere for the man. And certainly once a man begins to neglect\nhis domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate, does he not? And I\ndon\u2019t like that. It makes men so very attractive. Cecily, mamma, whose\nviews on education are remarkably strict, has brought me up to be\nextremely short-sighted; it is part of her system; so do you mind my\nlooking at you through my glasses?\n\nCECILY.\nOh! not at all, Gwendolen. I am very fond of being looked at.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[After examining Cecily carefully through a lorgnette.] You are here on\na short visit, I suppose.\n\nCECILY.\nOh no! I live here.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Severely.] Really? Your mother, no doubt, or some female relative of\nadvanced years, resides here also?\n\nCECILY.\nOh no! I have no mother, nor, in fact, any relations.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nIndeed?\n\nCECILY.\nMy dear guardian, with the assistance of Miss Prism, has the arduous\ntask of looking after me.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYour guardian?\n\nCECILY.\nYes, I am Mr. Worthing\u2019s ward.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nOh! It is strange he never mentioned to me that he had a ward. How\nsecretive of him! He grows more interesting hourly. I am not sure,\nhowever, that the news inspires me with feelings of unmixed delight.\n[Rising and going to her.] I am very fond of you, Cecily; I have liked\nyou ever since I met you! But I am bound to state that now that I know\nthat you are Mr. Worthing\u2019s ward, I cannot help expressing a wish you\nwere\u2014well, just a little older than you seem to be\u2014and not quite so\nvery alluring in appearance. In fact, if I may speak candidly\u2014\n\nCECILY.\nPray do! I think that whenever one has anything unpleasant to say, one\nshould always be quite candid.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nWell, to speak with perfect candour, Cecily, I wish that you were fully\nforty-two, and more than usually plain for your age. Ernest has a\nstrong upright nature. He is the very soul of truth and honour.\nDisloyalty would be as impossible to him as deception. But even men of\nthe noblest possible moral character are extremely susceptible to the\ninfluence of the physical charms of others. Modern, no less than\nAncient History, supplies us with many most painful examples of what I\nrefer to. If it were not so, indeed, History would be quite unreadable.\n\nCECILY.\nI beg your pardon, Gwendolen, did you say Ernest?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYes.\n\nCECILY.\nOh, but it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is my guardian. It is his\nbrother\u2014his elder brother.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Sitting down again.] Ernest never mentioned to me that he had a\nbrother.\n\nCECILY.\nI am sorry to say they have not been on good terms for a long time.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nAh! that accounts for it. And now that I think of it I have never heard\nany man mention his brother. The subject seems distasteful to most men.\nCecily, you have lifted a load from my mind. I was growing almost\nanxious. It would have been terrible if any cloud had come across a\nfriendship like ours, would it not? Of course you are quite, quite sure\nthat it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is your guardian?\n\nCECILY.\nQuite sure. [A pause.] In fact, I am going to be his.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Inquiringly.] I beg your pardon?\n\nCECILY.\n[Rather shy and confidingly.] Dearest Gwendolen, there is no reason why\nI should make a secret of it to you. Our little county newspaper is\nsure to chronicle the fact next week. Mr. Ernest Worthing and I are\nengaged to be married.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Quite politely, rising.] My darling Cecily, I think there must be some\nslight error. Mr. Ernest Worthing is engaged to me. The announcement\nwill appear in the _Morning Post_ on Saturday at the latest.\n\nCECILY.\n[Very politely, rising.] I am afraid you must be under some\nmisconception. Ernest proposed to me exactly ten minutes ago. [Shows\ndiary.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Examines diary through her lorgnettte carefully.] It is certainly very\ncurious, for he asked me to be his wife yesterday afternoon at 5.30. If\nyou would care to verify the incident, pray do so. [Produces diary of\nher own.] I never travel without my diary. One should always have\nsomething sensational to read in the train. I am so sorry, dear Cecily,\nif it is any disappointment to you, but I am afraid I have the prior\nclaim.\n\nCECILY.\nIt would distress me more than I can tell you, dear Gwendolen, if it\ncaused you any mental or physical anguish, but I feel bound to point\nout that since Ernest proposed to you he clearly has changed his mind.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Meditatively.] If the poor fellow has been entrapped into any foolish\npromise I shall consider it my duty to rescue him at once, and with a\nfirm hand.\n\nCECILY.\n[Thoughtfully and sadly.] Whatever unfortunate entanglement my dear boy\nmay have got into, I will never reproach him with it after we are\nmarried.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nDo you allude to me, Miss Cardew, as an entanglement? You are\npresumptuous. On an occasion of this kind it becomes more than a moral\nduty to speak one\u2019s mind. It becomes a pleasure.\n\nCECILY.\nDo you suggest, Miss Fairfax, that I entrapped Ernest into an\nengagement? How dare you? This is no time for wearing the shallow mask\nof manners. When I see a spade I call it a spade.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Satirically.] I am glad to say that I have never seen a spade. It is\nobvious that our social spheres have been widely different.\n\n[Enter Merriman, followed by the footman. He carries a salver, table\ncloth, and plate stand. Cecily is about to retort. The presence of the\nservants exercises a restraining influence, under which both girls\nchafe.]\n\nMERRIMAN.\nShall I lay tea here as usual, Miss?\n\nCECILY.\n[Sternly, in a calm voice.] Yes, as usual. [Merriman begins to clear\ntable and lay cloth. A long pause. Cecily and Gwendolen glare at each\nother.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nAre there many interesting walks in the vicinity, Miss Cardew?\n\nCECILY.\nOh! yes! a great many. From the top of one of the hills quite close one\ncan see five counties.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nFive counties! I don\u2019t think I should like that; I hate crowds.\n\nCECILY.\n[Sweetly.] I suppose that is why you live in town? [Gwendolen bites her\nlip, and beats her foot nervously with her parasol.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Looking round.] Quite a well-kept garden this is, Miss Cardew.\n\nCECILY.\nSo glad you like it, Miss Fairfax.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI had no idea there were any flowers in the country.\n\nCECILY.\nOh, flowers are as common here, Miss Fairfax, as people are in London.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nPersonally I cannot understand how anybody manages to exist in the\ncountry, if anybody who is anybody does. The country always bores me to\ndeath.\n\nCECILY.\nAh! This is what the newspapers call agricultural depression, is it\nnot? I believe the aristocracy are suffering very much from it just at\npresent. It is almost an epidemic amongst them, I have been told. May I\noffer you some tea, Miss Fairfax?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[With elaborate politeness.] Thank you. [Aside.] Detestable girl! But I\nrequire tea!\n\nCECILY.\n[Sweetly.] Sugar?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Superciliously.] No, thank you. Sugar is not fashionable any more.\n[Cecily looks angrily at her, takes up the tongs and puts four lumps of\nsugar into the cup.]\n\nCECILY.\n[Severely.] Cake or bread and butter?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[In a bored manner.] Bread and butter, please. Cake is rarely seen at\nthe best houses nowadays.\n\nCECILY.\n[Cuts a very large slice of cake, and puts it on the tray.] Hand that\nto Miss Fairfax.\n\n[Merriman does so, and goes out with footman. Gwendolen drinks the tea\nand makes a grimace. Puts down cup at once, reaches out her hand to the\nbread and butter, looks at it, and finds it is cake. Rises in\nindignation.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYou have filled my tea with lumps of sugar, and though I asked most\ndistinctly for bread and butter, you have given me cake. I am known for\nthe gentleness of my disposition, and the extraordinary sweetness of my\nnature, but I warn you, Miss Cardew, you may go too far.\n\nCECILY.\n[Rising.] To save my poor, innocent, trusting boy from the machinations\nof any other girl there are no lengths to which I would not go.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nFrom the moment I saw you I distrusted you. I felt that you were false\nand deceitful. I am never deceived in such matters. My first\nimpressions of people are invariably right.\n\nCECILY.\nIt seems to me, Miss Fairfax, that I am trespassing on your valuable\ntime. No doubt you have many other calls of a similar character to make\nin the neighbourhood.\n\n[Enter Jack.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Catching sight of him.] Ernest! My own Ernest!\n\nJACK.\nGwendolen! Darling! [Offers to kiss her.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Draws back.] A moment! May I ask if you are engaged to be married to\nthis young lady? [Points to Cecily.]\n\nJACK.\n[Laughing.] To dear little Cecily! Of course not! What could have put\nsuch an idea into your pretty little head?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThank you. You may! [Offers her cheek.]\n\nCECILY.\n[Very sweetly.] I knew there must be some misunderstanding, Miss\nFairfax. The gentleman whose arm is at present round your waist is my\nguardian, Mr. John Worthing.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI beg your pardon?\n\nCECILY.\nThis is Uncle Jack.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Receding.] Jack! Oh!\n\n[Enter Algernon.]\n\nCECILY.\nHere is Ernest.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Goes straight over to Cecily without noticing any one else.] My own\nlove! [Offers to kiss her.]\n\nCECILY.\n[Drawing back.] A moment, Ernest! May I ask you\u2014are you engaged to be\nmarried to this young lady?\n\nALGERNON.\n[Looking round.] To what young lady? Good heavens! Gwendolen!\n\nCECILY.\nYes! to good heavens, Gwendolen, I mean to Gwendolen.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Laughing.] Of course not! What could have put such an idea into your\npretty little head?\n\nCECILY.\nThank you. [Presenting her cheek to be kissed.] You may. [Algernon\nkisses her.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI felt there was some slight error, Miss Cardew. The gentleman who is\nnow embracing you is my cousin, Mr. Algernon Moncrieff.\n\nCECILY.\n[Breaking away from Algernon.] Algernon Moncrieff! Oh! [The two girls\nmove towards each other and put their arms round each other\u2019s waists as\nif for protection.]\n\nCECILY.\nAre you called Algernon?\n\nALGERNON.\nI cannot deny it.\n\nCECILY.\nOh!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nIs your name really John?\n\nJACK.\n[Standing rather proudly.] I could deny it if I liked. I could deny\nanything if I liked. But my name certainly is John. It has been John\nfor years.\n\nCECILY.\n[To Gwendolen.] A gross deception has been practised on both of us.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nMy poor wounded Cecily!\n\nCECILY.\nMy sweet wronged Gwendolen!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Slowly and seriously.] You will call me sister, will you not? [They\nembrace. Jack and Algernon groan and walk up and down.]\n\nCECILY.\n[Rather brightly.] There is just one question I would like to be\nallowed to ask my guardian.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nAn admirable idea! Mr. Worthing, there is just one question I would\nlike to be permitted to put to you. Where is your brother Ernest? We\nare both engaged to be married to your brother Ernest, so it is a\nmatter of some importance to us to know where your brother Ernest is at\npresent.\n\nJACK.\n[Slowly and hesitatingly.] Gwendolen\u2014Cecily\u2014it is very painful for me\nto be forced to speak the truth. It is the first time in my life that I\nhave ever been reduced to such a painful position, and I am really\nquite inexperienced in doing anything of the kind. However, I will tell\nyou quite frankly that I have no brother Ernest. I have no brother at\nall. I never had a brother in my life, and I certainly have not the\nsmallest intention of ever having one in the future.\n\nCECILY.\n[Surprised.] No brother at all?\n\nJACK.\n[Cheerily.] None!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[Severely.] Had you never a brother of any kind?\n\nJACK.\n[Pleasantly.] Never. Not even of any kind.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI am afraid it is quite clear, Cecily, that neither of us is engaged to\nbe married to any one.\n\nCECILY.\nIt is not a very pleasant position for a young girl suddenly to find\nherself in. Is it?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nLet us go into the house. They will hardly venture to come after us\nthere.\n\nCECILY.\nNo, men are so cowardly, aren\u2019t they?\n\n[They retire into the house with scornful looks.]\n\nJACK.\nThis ghastly state of things is what you call Bunburying, I suppose?\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, and a perfectly wonderful Bunbury it is. The most wonderful\nBunbury I have ever had in my life.\n\nJACK.\nWell, you\u2019ve no right whatsoever to Bunbury here.\n\nALGERNON.\nThat is absurd. One has a right to Bunbury anywhere one chooses. Every\nserious Bunburyist knows that.\n\nJACK.\nSerious Bunburyist! Good heavens!\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, one must be serious about something, if one wants to have any\namusement in life. I happen to be serious about Bunburying. What on\nearth you are serious about I haven\u2019t got the remotest idea. About\neverything, I should fancy. You have such an absolutely trivial nature.\n\nJACK.\nWell, the only small satisfaction I have in the whole of this wretched\nbusiness is that your friend Bunbury is quite exploded. You won\u2019t be\nable to run down to the country quite so often as you used to do, dear\nAlgy. And a very good thing too.\n\nALGERNON.\nYour brother is a little off colour, isn\u2019t he, dear Jack? You won\u2019t be\nable to disappear to London quite so frequently as your wicked custom\nwas. And not a bad thing either.\n\nJACK.\nAs for your conduct towards Miss Cardew, I must say that your taking in\na sweet, simple, innocent girl like that is quite inexcusable. To say\nnothing of the fact that she is my ward.\n\nALGERNON.\nI can see no possible defence at all for your deceiving a brilliant,\nclever, thoroughly experienced young lady like Miss Fairfax. To say\nnothing of the fact that she is my cousin.\n\nJACK.\nI wanted to be engaged to Gwendolen, that is all. I love her.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, I simply wanted to be engaged to Cecily. I adore her.\n\nJACK.\nThere is certainly no chance of your marrying Miss Cardew.\n\nALGERNON.\nI don\u2019t think there is much likelihood, Jack, of you and Miss Fairfax\nbeing united.\n\nJACK.\nWell, that is no business of yours.\n\nALGERNON.\nIf it was my business, I wouldn\u2019t talk about it. [Begins to eat\nmuffins.] It is very vulgar to talk about one\u2019s business. Only people\nlike stock-brokers do that, and then merely at dinner parties.\n\nJACK.\nHow can you sit there, calmly eating muffins when we are in this\nhorrible trouble, I can\u2019t make out. You seem to me to be perfectly\nheartless.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, I can\u2019t eat muffins in an agitated manner. The butter would\nprobably get on my cuffs. One should always eat muffins quite calmly.\nIt is the only way to eat them.\n\nJACK.\nI say it\u2019s perfectly heartless your eating muffins at all, under the\ncircumstances.\n\nALGERNON.\nWhen I am in trouble, eating is the only thing that consoles me.\nIndeed, when I am in really great trouble, as any one who knows me\nintimately will tell you, I refuse everything except food and drink. At\nthe present moment I am eating muffins because I am unhappy. Besides, I\nam particularly fond of muffins. [Rising.]\n\nJACK.\n[Rising.] Well, that is no reason why you should eat them all in that\ngreedy way. [Takes muffins from Algernon.]\n\nALGERNON.\n[Offering tea-cake.] I wish you would have tea-cake instead. I don\u2019t\nlike tea-cake.\n\nJACK.\nGood heavens! I suppose a man may eat his own muffins in his own\ngarden.\n\nALGERNON.\nBut you have just said it was perfectly heartless to eat muffins.\n\nJACK.\nI said it was perfectly heartless of you, under the circumstances. That\nis a very different thing.\n\nALGERNON.\nThat may be. But the muffins are the same. [He seizes the muffin-dish\nfrom Jack.]\n\nJACK.\nAlgy, I wish to goodness you would go.\n\nALGERNON.\nYou can\u2019t possibly ask me to go without having some dinner. It\u2019s\nabsurd. I never go without my dinner. No one ever does, except\nvegetarians and people like that. Besides I have just made arrangements\nwith Dr. Chasuble to be christened at a quarter to six under the name\nof Ernest.\n\nJACK.\nMy dear fellow, the sooner you give up that nonsense the better. I made\narrangements this morning with Dr. Chasuble to be christened myself at\n5.30, and I naturally will take the name of Ernest. Gwendolen would\nwish it. We can\u2019t both be christened Ernest. It\u2019s absurd. Besides, I\nhave a perfect right to be christened if I like. There is no evidence\nat all that I have ever been christened by anybody. I should think it\nextremely probable I never was, and so does Dr. Chasuble. It is\nentirely different in your case. You have been christened already.\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, but I have not been christened for years.\n\nJACK.\nYes, but you have been christened. That is the important thing.\n\nALGERNON.\nQuite so. So I know my constitution can stand it. If you are not quite\nsure about your ever having been christened, I must say I think it\nrather dangerous your venturing on it now. It might make you very\nunwell. You can hardly have forgotten that some one very closely\nconnected with you was very nearly carried off this week in Paris by a\nsevere chill.\n\nJACK.\nYes, but you said yourself that a severe chill was not hereditary.\n\nALGERNON.\nIt usen\u2019t to be, I know\u2014but I daresay it is now. Science is always\nmaking wonderful improvements in things.\n\nJACK.\n[Picking up the muffin-dish.] Oh, that is nonsense; you are always\ntalking nonsense.\n\nALGERNON.\nJack, you are at the muffins again! I wish you wouldn\u2019t. There are only\ntwo left. [Takes them.] I told you I was particularly fond of muffins.\n\nJACK.\nBut I hate tea-cake.\n\nALGERNON.\nWhy on earth then do you allow tea-cake to be served up for your\nguests? What ideas you have of hospitality!\n\nJACK.\nAlgernon! I have already told you to go. I don\u2019t want you here. Why\ndon\u2019t you go!\n\nALGERNON.\nI haven\u2019t quite finished my tea yet! and there is still one muffin\nleft. [Jack groans, and sinks into a chair. Algernon still continues\neating.]\n\nACT DROP\n\n\n\n\nTHIRD ACT\n\nSCENE\n\nMorning-room at the Manor House.\n\n[Gwendolen and Cecily are at the window, looking out into the garden.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThe fact that they did not follow us at once into the house, as any one\nelse would have done, seems to me to show that they have some sense of\nshame left.\n\nCECILY.\nThey have been eating muffins. That looks like repentance.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[After a pause.] They don\u2019t seem to notice us at all. Couldn\u2019t you\ncough?\n\nCECILY.\nBut I haven\u2019t got a cough.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThey\u2019re looking at us. What effrontery!\n\nCECILY.\nThey\u2019re approaching. That\u2019s very forward of them.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nLet us preserve a dignified silence.\n\nCECILY.\nCertainly. It\u2019s the only thing to do now. [Enter Jack followed by\nAlgernon. They whistle some dreadful popular air from a British Opera.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThis dignified silence seems to produce an unpleasant effect.\n\nCECILY.\nA most distasteful one.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nBut we will not be the first to speak.\n\nCECILY.\nCertainly not.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nMr. Worthing, I have something very particular to ask you. Much depends\non your reply.\n\nCECILY.\nGwendolen, your common sense is invaluable. Mr. Moncrieff, kindly\nanswer me the following question. Why did you pretend to be my\nguardian\u2019s brother?\n\nALGERNON.\nIn order that I might have an opportunity of meeting you.\n\nCECILY.\n[To Gwendolen.] That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does\nit not?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nYes, dear, if you can believe him.\n\nCECILY.\nI don\u2019t. But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of his answer.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nTrue. In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity is the vital\nthing. Mr. Worthing, what explanation can you offer to me for\npretending to have a brother? Was it in order that you might have an\nopportunity of coming up to town to see me as often as possible?\n\nJACK.\nCan you doubt it, Miss Fairfax?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI have the gravest doubts upon the subject. But I intend to crush them.\nThis is not the moment for German scepticism. [Moving to Cecily.] Their\nexplanations appear to be quite satisfactory, especially Mr.\nWorthing\u2019s. That seems to me to have the stamp of truth upon it.\n\nCECILY.\nI am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said. His voice alone\ninspires one with absolute credulity.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThen you think we should forgive them?\n\nCECILY.\nYes. I mean no.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nTrue! I had forgotten. There are principles at stake that one cannot\nsurrender. Which of us should tell them? The task is not a pleasant\none.\n\nCECILY.\nCould we not both speak at the same time?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nAn excellent idea! I nearly always speak at the same time as other\npeople. Will you take the time from me?\n\nCECILY.\nCertainly. [Gwendolen beats time with uplifted finger.]\n\nGWENDOLEN and CECILY [Speaking together.] Your Christian names are\nstill an insuperable barrier. That is all!\n\nJACK and ALGERNON [Speaking together.] Our Christian names! Is that\nall? But we are going to be christened this afternoon.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[To Jack.] For my sake you are prepared to do this terrible thing?\n\nJACK.\nI am.\n\nCECILY.\n[To Algernon.] To please me you are ready to face this fearful ordeal?\n\nALGERNON.\nI am!\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nHow absurd to talk of the equality of the sexes! Where questions of\nself-sacrifice are concerned, men are infinitely beyond us.\n\nJACK.\nWe are. [Clasps hands with Algernon.]\n\nCECILY.\nThey have moments of physical courage of which we women know absolutely\nnothing.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[To Jack.] Darling!\n\nALGERNON.\n[To Cecily.] Darling! [They fall into each other\u2019s arms.]\n\n[Enter Merriman. When he enters he coughs loudly, seeing the\nsituation.]\n\nMERRIMAN.\nAhem! Ahem! Lady Bracknell!\n\nJACK.\nGood heavens!\n\n[Enter Lady Bracknell. The couples separate in alarm. Exit Merriman.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nGwendolen! What does this mean?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nMerely that I am engaged to be married to Mr. Worthing, mamma.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nCome here. Sit down. Sit down immediately. Hesitation of any kind is a\nsign of mental decay in the young, of physical weakness in the old.\n[Turns to Jack.] Apprised, sir, of my daughter\u2019s sudden flight by her\ntrusty maid, whose confidence I purchased by means of a small coin, I\nfollowed her at once by a luggage train. Her unhappy father is, I am\nglad to say, under the impression that she is attending a more than\nusually lengthy lecture by the University Extension Scheme on the\nInfluence of a permanent income on Thought. I do not propose to\nundeceive him. Indeed I have never undeceived him on any question. I\nwould consider it wrong. But of course, you will clearly understand\nthat all communication between yourself and my daughter must cease\nimmediately from this moment. On this point, as indeed on all points, I\nam firm.\n\nJACK.\nI am engaged to be married to Gwendolen, Lady Bracknell!\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nYou are nothing of the kind, sir. And now, as regards Algernon! . . .\nAlgernon!\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nMay I ask if it is in this house that your invalid friend Mr. Bunbury\nresides?\n\nALGERNON.\n[Stammering.] Oh! No! Bunbury doesn\u2019t live here. Bunbury is somewhere\nelse at present. In fact, Bunbury is dead.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nDead! When did Mr. Bunbury die? His death must have been extremely\nsudden.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Airily.] Oh! I killed Bunbury this afternoon. I mean poor Bunbury died\nthis afternoon.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nWhat did he die of?\n\nALGERNON.\nBunbury? Oh, he was quite exploded.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nExploded! Was he the victim of a revolutionary outrage? I was not aware\nthat Mr. Bunbury was interested in social legislation. If so, he is\nwell punished for his morbidity.\n\nALGERNON.\nMy dear Aunt Augusta, I mean he was found out! The doctors found out\nthat Bunbury could not live, that is what I mean\u2014so Bunbury died.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nHe seems to have had great confidence in the opinion of his physicians.\nI am glad, however, that he made up his mind at the last to some\ndefinite course of action, and acted under proper medical advice. And\nnow that we have finally got rid of this Mr. Bunbury, may I ask, Mr.\nWorthing, who is that young person whose hand my nephew Algernon is now\nholding in what seems to me a peculiarly unnecessary manner?\n\nJACK.\nThat lady is Miss Cecily Cardew, my ward. [Lady Bracknell bows coldly\nto Cecily.]\n\nALGERNON.\nI am engaged to be married to Cecily, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nI beg your pardon?\n\nCECILY.\nMr. Moncrieff and I are engaged to be married, Lady Bracknell.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[With a shiver, crossing to the sofa and sitting down.] I do not know\nwhether there is anything peculiarly exciting in the air of this\nparticular part of Hertfordshire, but the number of engagements that go\non seems to me considerably above the proper average that statistics\nhave laid down for our guidance. I think some preliminary inquiry on my\npart would not be out of place. Mr. Worthing, is Miss Cardew at all\nconnected with any of the larger railway stations in London? I merely\ndesire information. Until yesterday I had no idea that there were any\nfamilies or persons whose origin was a Terminus. [Jack looks perfectly\nfurious, but restrains himself.]\n\nJACK.\n[In a clear, cold voice.] Miss Cardew is the grand-daughter of the late\nMr. Thomas Cardew of 149 Belgrave Square, S.W.; Gervase Park, Dorking,\nSurrey; and the Sporran, Fifeshire, N.B.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThat sounds not unsatisfactory. Three addresses always inspire\nconfidence, even in tradesmen. But what proof have I of their\nauthenticity?\n\nJACK.\nI have carefully preserved the Court Guides of the period. They are\nopen to your inspection, Lady Bracknell.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Grimly.] I have known strange errors in that publication.\n\nJACK.\nMiss Cardew\u2019s family solicitors are Messrs. Markby, Markby, and Markby.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nMarkby, Markby, and Markby? A firm of the very highest position in\ntheir profession. Indeed I am told that one of the Mr. Markby\u2019s is\noccasionally to be seen at dinner parties. So far I am satisfied.\n\nJACK.\n[Very irritably.] How extremely kind of you, Lady Bracknell! I have\nalso in my possession, you will be pleased to hear, certificates of\nMiss Cardew\u2019s birth, baptism, whooping cough, registration,\nvaccination, confirmation, and the measles; both the German and the\nEnglish variety.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nAh! A life crowded with incident, I see; though perhaps somewhat too\nexciting for a young girl. I am not myself in favour of premature\nexperiences. [Rises, looks at her watch.] Gwendolen! the time\napproaches for our departure. We have not a moment to lose. As a matter\nof form, Mr. Worthing, I had better ask you if Miss Cardew has any\nlittle fortune?\n\nJACK.\nOh! about a hundred and thirty thousand pounds in the Funds. That is\nall. Goodbye, Lady Bracknell. So pleased to have seen you.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Sitting down again.] A moment, Mr. Worthing. A hundred and thirty\nthousand pounds! And in the Funds! Miss Cardew seems to me a most\nattractive young lady, now that I look at her. Few girls of the present\nday have any really solid qualities, any of the qualities that last,\nand improve with time. We live, I regret to say, in an age of surfaces.\n[To Cecily.] Come over here, dear. [Cecily goes across.] Pretty child!\nyour dress is sadly simple, and your hair seems almost as Nature might\nhave left it. But we can soon alter all that. A thoroughly experienced\nFrench maid produces a really marvellous result in a very brief space\nof time. I remember recommending one to young Lady Lancing, and after\nthree months her own husband did not know her.\n\nJACK.\nAnd after six months nobody knew her.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Glares at Jack for a few moments. Then bends, with a practised smile,\nto Cecily.] Kindly turn round, sweet child. [Cecily turns completely\nround.] No, the side view is what I want. [Cecily presents her\nprofile.] Yes, quite as I expected. There are distinct social\npossibilities in your profile. The two weak points in our age are its\nwant of principle and its want of profile. The chin a little higher,\ndear. Style largely depends on the way the chin is worn. They are worn\nvery high, just at present. Algernon!\n\nALGERNON.\nYes, Aunt Augusta!\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThere are distinct social possibilities in Miss Cardew\u2019s profile.\n\nALGERNON.\nCecily is the sweetest, dearest, prettiest girl in the whole world. And\nI don\u2019t care twopence about social possibilities.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nNever speak disrespectfully of Society, Algernon. Only people who can\u2019t\nget into it do that. [To Cecily.] Dear child, of course you know that\nAlgernon has nothing but his debts to depend upon. But I do not approve\nof mercenary marriages. When I married Lord Bracknell I had no fortune\nof any kind. But I never dreamed for a moment of allowing that to stand\nin my way. Well, I suppose I must give my consent.\n\nALGERNON.\nThank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nCecily, you may kiss me!\n\nCECILY.\n[Kisses her.] Thank you, Lady Bracknell.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nYou may also address me as Aunt Augusta for the future.\n\nCECILY.\nThank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThe marriage, I think, had better take place quite soon.\n\nALGERNON.\nThank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\nCECILY.\nThank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nTo speak frankly, I am not in favour of long engagements. They give\npeople the opportunity of finding out each other\u2019s character before\nmarriage, which I think is never advisable.\n\nJACK.\nI beg your pardon for interrupting you, Lady Bracknell, but this\nengagement is quite out of the question. I am Miss Cardew\u2019s guardian,\nand she cannot marry without my consent until she comes of age. That\nconsent I absolutely decline to give.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nUpon what grounds may I ask? Algernon is an extremely, I may almost say\nan ostentatiously, eligible young man. He has nothing, but he looks\neverything. What more can one desire?\n\nJACK.\nIt pains me very much to have to speak frankly to you, Lady Bracknell,\nabout your nephew, but the fact is that I do not approve at all of his\nmoral character. I suspect him of being untruthful. [Algernon and\nCecily look at him in indignant amazement.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nUntruthful! My nephew Algernon? Impossible! He is an Oxonian.\n\nJACK.\nI fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter. This afternoon\nduring my temporary absence in London on an important question of\nromance, he obtained admission to my house by means of the false\npretence of being my brother. Under an assumed name he drank, I\u2019ve just\nbeen informed by my butler, an entire pint bottle of my Perrier-Jouet,\nBrut, \u201989; wine I was specially reserving for myself. Continuing his\ndisgraceful deception, he succeeded in the course of the afternoon in\nalienating the affections of my only ward. He subsequently stayed to\ntea, and devoured every single muffin. And what makes his conduct all\nthe more heartless is, that he was perfectly well aware from the first\nthat I have no brother, that I never had a brother, and that I don\u2019t\nintend to have a brother, not even of any kind. I distinctly told him\nso myself yesterday afternoon.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nAhem! Mr. Worthing, after careful consideration I have decided entirely\nto overlook my nephew\u2019s conduct to you.\n\nJACK.\nThat is very generous of you, Lady Bracknell. My own decision, however,\nis unalterable. I decline to give my consent.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[To Cecily.] Come here, sweet child. [Cecily goes over.] How old are\nyou, dear?\n\nCECILY.\nWell, I am really only eighteen, but I always admit to twenty when I go\nto evening parties.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nYou are perfectly right in making some slight alteration. Indeed, no\nwoman should ever be quite accurate about her age. It looks so\ncalculating . . . [In a meditative manner.] Eighteen, but admitting to\ntwenty at evening parties. Well, it will not be very long before you\nare of age and free from the restraints of tutelage. So I don\u2019t think\nyour guardian\u2019s consent is, after all, a matter of any importance.\n\nJACK.\nPray excuse me, Lady Bracknell, for interrupting you again, but it is\nonly fair to tell you that according to the terms of her grandfather\u2019s\nwill Miss Cardew does not come legally of age till she is thirty-five.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThat does not seem to me to be a grave objection. Thirty-five is a very\nattractive age. London society is full of women of the very highest\nbirth who have, of their own free choice, remained thirty-five for\nyears. Lady Dumbleton is an instance in point. To my own knowledge she\nhas been thirty-five ever since she arrived at the age of forty, which\nwas many years ago now. I see no reason why our dear Cecily should not\nbe even still more attractive at the age you mention than she is at\npresent. There will be a large accumulation of property.\n\nCECILY.\nAlgy, could you wait for me till I was thirty-five?\n\nALGERNON.\nOf course I could, Cecily. You know I could.\n\nCECILY.\nYes, I felt it instinctively, but I couldn\u2019t wait all that time. I hate\nwaiting even five minutes for anybody. It always makes me rather cross.\nI am not punctual myself, I know, but I do like punctuality in others,\nand waiting, even to be married, is quite out of the question.\n\nALGERNON.\nThen what is to be done, Cecily?\n\nCECILY.\nI don\u2019t know, Mr. Moncrieff.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nMy dear Mr. Worthing, as Miss Cardew states positively that she cannot\nwait till she is thirty-five\u2014a remark which I am bound to say seems to\nme to show a somewhat impatient nature\u2014I would beg of you to reconsider\nyour decision.\n\nJACK.\nBut my dear Lady Bracknell, the matter is entirely in your own hands.\nThe moment you consent to my marriage with Gwendolen, I will most\ngladly allow your nephew to form an alliance with my ward.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Rising and drawing herself up.] You must be quite aware that what you\npropose is out of the question.\n\nJACK.\nThen a passionate celibacy is all that any of us can look forward to.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThat is not the destiny I propose for Gwendolen. Algernon, of course,\ncan choose for himself. [Pulls out her watch.] Come, dear, [Gwendolen\nrises] we have already missed five, if not six, trains. To miss any\nmore might expose us to comment on the platform.\n\n[Enter Dr. Chasuble.]\n\nCHASUBLE.\nEverything is quite ready for the christenings.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThe christenings, sir! Is not that somewhat premature?\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[Looking rather puzzled, and pointing to Jack and Algernon.] Both these\ngentlemen have expressed a desire for immediate baptism.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nAt their age? The idea is grotesque and irreligious! Algernon, I forbid\nyou to be baptized. I will not hear of such excesses. Lord Bracknell\nwould be highly displeased if he learned that that was the way in which\nyou wasted your time and money.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nAm I to understand then that there are to be no christenings at all\nthis afternoon?\n\nJACK.\nI don\u2019t think that, as things are now, it would be of much practical\nvalue to either of us, Dr. Chasuble.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nI am grieved to hear such sentiments from you, Mr. Worthing. They\nsavour of the heretical views of the Anabaptists, views that I have\ncompletely refuted in four of my unpublished sermons. However, as your\npresent mood seems to be one peculiarly secular, I will return to the\nchurch at once. Indeed, I have just been informed by the pew-opener\nthat for the last hour and a half Miss Prism has been waiting for me in\nthe vestry.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Starting.] Miss Prism! Did I hear you mention a Miss Prism?\n\nCHASUBLE.\nYes, Lady Bracknell. I am on my way to join her.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nPray allow me to detain you for a moment. This matter may prove to be\none of vital importance to Lord Bracknell and myself. Is this Miss\nPrism a female of repellent aspect, remotely connected with education?\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[Somewhat indignantly.] She is the most cultivated of ladies, and the\nvery picture of respectability.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nIt is obviously the same person. May I ask what position she holds in\nyour household?\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[Severely.] I am a celibate, madam.\n\nJACK.\n[Interposing.] Miss Prism, Lady Bracknell, has been for the last three\nyears Miss Cardew\u2019s esteemed governess and valued companion.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nIn spite of what I hear of her, I must see her at once. Let her be sent\nfor.\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[Looking off.] She approaches; she is nigh.\n\n[Enter Miss Prism hurriedly.]\n\nMISS PRISM.\nI was told you expected me in the vestry, dear Canon. I have been\nwaiting for you there for an hour and three-quarters. [Catches sight of\nLady Bracknell, who has fixed her with a stony glare. Miss Prism grows\npale and quails. She looks anxiously round as if desirous to escape.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[In a severe, judicial voice.] Prism! [Miss Prism bows her head in\nshame.] Come here, Prism! [Miss Prism approaches in a humble manner.]\nPrism! Where is that baby? [General consternation. The Canon starts\nback in horror. Algernon and Jack pretend to be anxious to shield\nCecily and Gwendolen from hearing the details of a terrible public\nscandal.] Twenty-eight years ago, Prism, you left Lord Bracknell\u2019s\nhouse, Number 104, Upper Grosvenor Street, in charge of a perambulator\nthat contained a baby of the male sex. You never returned. A few weeks\nlater, through the elaborate investigations of the Metropolitan police,\nthe perambulator was discovered at midnight, standing by itself in a\nremote corner of Bayswater. It contained the manuscript of a\nthree-volume novel of more than usually revolting sentimentality. [Miss\nPrism starts in involuntary indignation.] But the baby was not there!\n[Every one looks at Miss Prism.] Prism! Where is that baby? [A pause.]\n\nMISS PRISM.\nLady Bracknell, I admit with shame that I do not know. I only wish I\ndid. The plain facts of the case are these. On the morning of the day\nyou mention, a day that is for ever branded on my memory, I prepared as\nusual to take the baby out in its perambulator. I had also with me a\nsomewhat old, but capacious hand-bag in which I had intended to place\nthe manuscript of a work of fiction that I had written during my few\nunoccupied hours. In a moment of mental abstraction, for which I never\ncan forgive myself, I deposited the manuscript in the basinette, and\nplaced the baby in the hand-bag.\n\nJACK.\n[Who has been listening attentively.] But where did you deposit the\nhand-bag?\n\nMISS PRISM.\nDo not ask me, Mr. Worthing.\n\nJACK.\nMiss Prism, this is a matter of no small importance to me. I insist on\nknowing where you deposited the hand-bag that contained that infant.\n\nMISS PRISM.\nI left it in the cloak-room of one of the larger railway stations in\nLondon.\n\nJACK.\nWhat railway station?\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Quite crushed.] Victoria. The Brighton line. [Sinks into a chair.]\n\nJACK.\nI must retire to my room for a moment. Gwendolen, wait here for me.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nIf you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my life. [Exit\nJack in great excitement.]\n\nCHASUBLE.\nWhat do you think this means, Lady Bracknell?\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nI dare not even suspect, Dr. Chasuble. I need hardly tell you that in\nfamilies of high position strange coincidences are not supposed to\noccur. They are hardly considered the thing.\n\n[Noises heard overhead as if some one was throwing trunks about. Every\none looks up.]\n\nCECILY.\nUncle Jack seems strangely agitated.\n\nCHASUBLE.\nYour guardian has a very emotional nature.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThis noise is extremely unpleasant. It sounds as if he was having an\nargument. I dislike arguments of any kind. They are always vulgar, and\noften convincing.\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[Looking up.] It has stopped now. [The noise is redoubled.]\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nI wish he would arrive at some conclusion.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nThis suspense is terrible. I hope it will last. [Enter Jack with a\nhand-bag of black leather in his hand.]\n\nJACK.\n[Rushing over to Miss Prism.] Is this the hand-bag, Miss Prism? Examine\nit carefully before you speak. The happiness of more than one life\ndepends on your answer.\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Calmly.] It seems to be mine. Yes, here is the injury it received\nthrough the upsetting of a Gower Street omnibus in younger and happier\ndays. Here is the stain on the lining caused by the explosion of a\ntemperance beverage, an incident that occurred at Leamington. And here,\non the lock, are my initials. I had forgotten that in an extravagant\nmood I had had them placed there. The bag is undoubtedly mine. I am\ndelighted to have it so unexpectedly restored to me. It has been a\ngreat inconvenience being without it all these years.\n\nJACK.\n[In a pathetic voice.] Miss Prism, more is restored to you than this\nhand-bag. I was the baby you placed in it.\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Amazed.] You?\n\nJACK.\n[Embracing her.] Yes . . . mother!\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Recoiling in indignant astonishment.] Mr. Worthing! I am unmarried!\n\nJACK.\nUnmarried! I do not deny that is a serious blow. But after all, who has\nthe right to cast a stone against one who has suffered? Cannot\nrepentance wipe out an act of folly? Why should there be one law for\nmen, and another for women? Mother, I forgive you. [Tries to embrace\nher again.]\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Still more indignant.] Mr. Worthing, there is some error. [Pointing to\nLady Bracknell.] There is the lady who can tell you who you really are.\n\nJACK.\n[After a pause.] Lady Bracknell, I hate to seem inquisitive, but would\nyou kindly inform me who I am?\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nI am afraid that the news I have to give you will not altogether please\nyou. You are the son of my poor sister, Mrs. Moncrieff, and\nconsequently Algernon\u2019s elder brother.\n\nJACK.\nAlgy\u2019s elder brother! Then I have a brother after all. I knew I had a\nbrother! I always said I had a brother! Cecily,\u2014how could you have ever\ndoubted that I had a brother? [Seizes hold of Algernon.] Dr. Chasuble,\nmy unfortunate brother. Miss Prism, my unfortunate brother. Gwendolen,\nmy unfortunate brother. Algy, you young scoundrel, you will have to\ntreat me with more respect in the future. You have never behaved to me\nlike a brother in all your life.\n\nALGERNON.\nWell, not till to-day, old boy, I admit. I did my best, however, though\nI was out of practice.\n\n[Shakes hands.]\n\nGWENDOLEN.\n[To Jack.] My own! But what own are you? What is your Christian name,\nnow that you have become some one else?\n\nJACK.\nGood heavens! . . . I had quite forgotten that point. Your decision on\nthe subject of my name is irrevocable, I suppose?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI never change, except in my affections.\n\nCECILY.\nWhat a noble nature you have, Gwendolen!\n\nJACK.\nThen the question had better be cleared up at once. Aunt Augusta, a\nmoment. At the time when Miss Prism left me in the hand-bag, had I been\nchristened already?\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nEvery luxury that money could buy, including christening, had been\nlavished on you by your fond and doting parents.\n\nJACK.\nThen I was christened! That is settled. Now, what name was I given? Let\nme know the worst.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nBeing the eldest son you were naturally christened after your father.\n\nJACK.\n[Irritably.] Yes, but what was my father\u2019s Christian name?\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\n[Meditatively.] I cannot at the present moment recall what the\nGeneral\u2019s Christian name was. But I have no doubt he had one. He was\neccentric, I admit. But only in later years. And that was the result of\nthe Indian climate, and marriage, and indigestion, and other things of\nthat kind.\n\nJACK.\nAlgy! Can\u2019t you recollect what our father\u2019s Christian name was?\n\nALGERNON.\nMy dear boy, we were never even on speaking terms. He died before I was\na year old.\n\nJACK.\nHis name would appear in the Army Lists of the period, I suppose, Aunt\nAugusta?\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nThe General was essentially a man of peace, except in his domestic\nlife. But I have no doubt his name would appear in any military\ndirectory.\n\nJACK.\nThe Army Lists of the last forty years are here. These delightful\nrecords should have been my constant study. [Rushes to bookcase and\ntears the books out.] M. Generals . . . Mallam, Maxbohm, Magley, what\nghastly names they have\u2014Markby, Migsby, Mobbs, Moncrieff! Lieutenant\n1840, Captain, Lieutenant-Colonel, Colonel, General 1869, Christian\nnames, Ernest John. [Puts book very quietly down and speaks quite\ncalmly.] I always told you, Gwendolen, my name was Ernest, didn\u2019t I?\nWell, it is Ernest after all. I mean it naturally is Ernest.\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nYes, I remember now that the General was called Ernest, I knew I had\nsome particular reason for disliking the name.\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nErnest! My own Ernest! I felt from the first that you could have no\nother name!\n\nJACK.\nGwendolen, it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that\nall his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth. Can you\nforgive me?\n\nGWENDOLEN.\nI can. For I feel that you are sure to change.\n\nJACK.\nMy own one!\n\nCHASUBLE.\n[To Miss Prism.] L\u00e6titia! [Embraces her]\n\nMISS PRISM.\n[Enthusiastically.] Frederick! At last!\n\nALGERNON.\nCecily! [Embraces her.] At last!\n\nJACK.\nGwendolen! [Embraces her.] At last!\n\nLADY BRACKNELL.\nMy nephew, you seem to be displaying signs of triviality.\n\nJACK.\nOn the contrary, Aunt Augusta, I\u2019ve now realised for the first time in\nmy life the vital Importance of Being Earnest.\n\nTABLEAU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST: A TRIVIAL COMEDY FOR SERIOUS PEOPLE ***\n\n\n    \n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

        "summary": "**Summary of \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" by Oscar Wilde**\n\n**Overview:**\n\"The Importance of Being Earnest\" is a comedic play by Oscar Wilde, first performed on February 14, 1895. It centers around two main characters, Jack Worthing and Algernon Moncrieff, who employ fictional identities to escape social obligations.\n\n**Main Characters:**\n- John Worthing (Jack)\n- Algernon Moncrieff\n- Lady Bracknell\n- Gwendolen Fairfax\n- Cecily Cardew\n- Miss Prism (governess)\n- Rev. Canon Chasuble, D.D.\n- Lane (servant)\n- Merriman (butler)\n\n**Plot Summary:**\n- **Act 1:** In Algernon's flat, Jack (who pretends to be Ernest in town) visits to propose to Gwendolen. Algernon mocks Jack's double life and reveals he has an invalid friend named Bunbury to escape obligations. Jack discusses his ward, Cecily, whom he plans to keep away from Algernon. \n\n- **Act 2:** Set in the garden at Jack's country house, Cecily meets Algernon, who pretends to be Jack's brother, Ernest. They fall for each other, unaware of the truth. The act reveals misunderstandings regarding identity and engagements between characters.\n\n- **Act 3:** In the morning-room, Gwendolen and Cecily confront their engagements to \"Ernest.\" Jack and Algernon reveal they have both been deceiving the women. Lady Bracknell enters and challenges the men's moral character, demanding background checks and family lineage. The truth about Jack's origins emerges, including the revelation that he was raised by Miss Prism, who lost him as a baby in a handbag.\n\n**Resolution:**\nUltimately, Jack discovers he is truly named Ernest, fulfilling the expectations of the women who prefer that name. Both couples become engaged, resolving the confusion over identities.\n\n**Themes:**\n- The nature of identity and deception.\n- Social expectations and hypocrisy.\n- The triviality of societal norms versus true affection.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWilde's play cleverly critiques Victorian society, revealing the absurdities of courtship and social status, while emphasizing the importance of being earnest about one's identity and intentions.",

LANYON\u2019S NARRATIVE\n\n HENRY JEKYLL\u2019S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n\nSTORY OF THE DOOR\n\nMr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was\nnever lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse;\nbackward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow\nlovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste,\nsomething eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which\nnever found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these\nsilent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in\nthe acts of his life. He was austere with himself; drank gin when he\nwas alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the\ntheatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he had\nan approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with\nenvy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and\nin any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove. \u201cI incline to\nCain\u2019s heresy,\u201d he used to say quaintly: \u201cI let my brother go to the\ndevil in his own way.\u201d In this character, it was frequently his fortune\nto be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in\nthe lives of downgoing men. And to such as these, so long as they came\nabout his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.\n\nNo doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative\nat the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar\ncatholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to accept\nhis friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that\nwas the lawyer\u2019s way. His friends were those of his own blood or those\nwhom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the\ngrowth of time, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt\nthe bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman,\nthe well-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for many, what\nthese two could see in each other, or what subject they could find in\ncommon. It was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday\nwalks, that they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail\nwith obvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two\nmen put the greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief\njewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but\neven resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them\nuninterrupted.\n\nIt chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a\nby-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what is\ncalled quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The\ninhabitants were all doing well, it seemed, and all emulously hoping to\ndo better still, and laying out the surplus of their gains in coquetry;\nso that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of\ninvitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday, when it\nveiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage,\nthe street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a fire\nin a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters, well-polished\nbrasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught\nand pleased the eye of the passenger.\n\nTwo doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was\nbroken by the entry of a court; and just at that point a certain\nsinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street. It\nwas two storeys high; showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower\nstorey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper; and bore\nin every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence. The\ndoor, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered\nand distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on\nthe panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had tried\nhis knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one had\nappeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their\nravages.\n\nMr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; but\nwhen they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane and\npointed.\n\n\u201cDid you ever remark that door?\u201d he asked; and when his companion had\nreplied in the affirmative, \u201cIt is connected in my mind,\u201d added he,\n\u201cwith a very odd story.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed?\u201d said Mr. Utterson, with a slight change of voice, \u201cand what\nwas that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it was this way,\u201d returned Mr. Enfield: \u201cI was coming home from\nsome place at the end of the world, about three o\u2019clock of a black\nwinter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was\nliterally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street and all the\nfolks asleep\u2014street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession\nand all as empty as a church\u2014till at last I got into that state of mind\nwhen a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a\npoliceman. All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was\nstumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe\neight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross\nstreet. Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at the\ncorner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man\ntrampled calmly over the child\u2019s body and left her screaming on the\nground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It wasn\u2019t\nlike a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a few halloa,\ntook to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where\nthere was already quite a group about the screaming child. He was\nperfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly\nthat it brought out the sweat on me like running. The people who had\nturned out were the girl\u2019s own family; and pretty soon, the doctor, for\nwhom she had been sent, put in his appearance. Well, the child was not\nmuch the worse, more frightened, according to the sawbones; and there\nyou might have supposed would be an end to it. But there was one\ncurious circumstance. I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first\nsight. So had the child\u2019s family, which was only natural. But the\ndoctor\u2019s case was what struck me. He was the usual cut and dry\napothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh\naccent and about as emotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the\nrest of us; every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that sawbones\nturn sick and white with the desire to kill him. I knew what was in his\nmind, just as he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of the\nquestion, we did the next best. We told the man we could and would make\nsuch a scandal out of this as should make his name stink from one end\nof London to the other. If he had any friends or any credit, we\nundertook that he should lose them. And all the time, as we were\npitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best we\ncould for they were as wild as harpies. I never saw a circle of such\nhateful faces; and there was the man in the middle, with a kind of\nblack sneering coolness\u2014frightened too, I could see that\u2014but carrying\nit off, sir, really like Satan. \u2018If you choose to make capital out of\nthis accident,\u2019 said he, \u2018I am naturally helpless. No gentleman but\nwishes to avoid a scene,\u2019 says he. \u2018Name your figure.\u2019 Well, we screwed\nhim up to a hundred pounds for the child\u2019s family; he would have\nclearly liked to stick out; but there was something about the lot of us\nthat meant mischief, and at last he struck. The next thing was to get\nthe money; and where do you think he carried us but to that place with\nthe door?\u2014whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with the\nmatter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts\u2019s,\ndrawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can\u2019t mention,\nthough it\u2019s one of the points of my story, but it was a name at least\nvery well known and often printed. The figure was stiff; but the\nsignature was good for more than that if it was only genuine. I took\nthe liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business\nlooked apocryphal, and that a man does not, in real life, walk into a\ncellar door at four in the morning and come out with another man\u2019s\ncheque for close upon a hundred pounds. But he was quite easy and\nsneering. \u2018Set your mind at rest,\u2019 says he, \u2018I will stay with you till\nthe banks open and cash the cheque myself.\u2019 So we all set off, the\ndoctor, and the child\u2019s father, and our friend and myself, and passed\nthe rest of the night in my chambers; and next day, when we had\nbreakfasted, went in a body to the bank. I gave in the cheque myself,\nand said I had every reason to believe it was a forgery. Not a bit of\nit. The cheque was genuine.\u201d\n\n\u201cTut-tut!\u201d said Mr. Utterson.\n\n\u201cI see you feel as I do,\u201d said Mr. Enfield. \u201cYes, it\u2019s a bad story. For\nmy man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really\ndamnable man; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of\nthe proprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one of your\nfellows who do what they call good. Blackmail, I suppose; an honest man\npaying through the nose for some of the capers of his youth. Black Mail\nHouse is what I call the place with the door, in consequence. Though\neven that, you know, is far from explaining all,\u201d he added, and with\nthe words fell into a vein of musing.\n\nFrom this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly: \u201cAnd\nyou don\u2019t know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?\u201d\n\n\u201cA likely place, isn\u2019t it?\u201d returned Mr. Enfield. \u201cBut I happen to have\nnoticed his address; he lives in some square or other.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you never asked about the\u2014place with the door?\u201d said Mr. Utterson.\n\n\u201cNo, sir; I had a delicacy,\u201d was the reply. \u201cI feel very strongly about\nputting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the day of\njudgment. You start a question, and it\u2019s like starting a stone. You sit\nquietly on the top of a hill; and away the stone goes, starting others;\nand presently some bland old bird (the last you would have thought of)\nis knocked on the head in his own back garden and the family have to\nchange their name. No sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks\nlike Queer Street, the less I ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cA very good rule, too,\u201d said the lawyer.\n\n\u201cBut I have studied the place for myself,\u201d continued Mr. Enfield. \u201cIt\nseems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody goes in or\nout of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of my\nadventure. There are three windows looking on the court on the first\nfloor; none below; the windows are always shut but they\u2019re clean. And\nthen there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so somebody must\nlive there. And yet it\u2019s not so sure; for the buildings are so packed\ntogether about the court, that it\u2019s hard to say where one ends and\nanother begins.\u201d\n\nThe pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then \u201cEnfield,\u201d\nsaid Mr. Utterson, \u201cthat\u2019s a good rule of yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I think it is,\u201d returned Enfield.\n\n\u201cBut for all that,\u201d continued the lawyer, \u201cthere\u2019s one point I want to\nask. I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Mr. Enfield, \u201cI can\u2019t see what harm it would do. It was a\nman of the name of Hyde.\u201d\n\n\u201cHm,\u201d said Mr. Utterson. \u201cWhat sort of a man is he to see?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is not easy to describe. There is something wrong with his\nappearance; something displeasing, something down-right detestable. I\nnever saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why. He must be\ndeformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although I\ncouldn\u2019t specify the point. He\u2019s an extraordinary looking man, and yet\nI really can name nothing out of the way. No, sir; I can make no hand\nof it; I can\u2019t describe him. And it\u2019s not want of memory; for I declare\nI can see him this moment.\u201d\n\nMr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a\nweight of consideration. \u201cYou are sure he used a key?\u201d he inquired at\nlast.\n\n\u201cMy dear sir...\u201d began Enfield, surprised out of himself.\n\n\u201cYes, I know,\u201d said Utterson; \u201cI know it must seem strange. The fact\nis, if I do not ask you the name of the other party, it is because I\nknow it already. You see, Richard, your tale has gone home. If you have\nbeen inexact in any point you had better correct it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you might have warned me,\u201d returned the other with a touch of\nsullenness. \u201cBut I have been pedantically exact, as you call it. The\nfellow had a key; and what\u2019s more, he has it still. I saw him use it\nnot a week ago.\u201d\n\nMr. Utterson sighed deeply but said never a word; and the young man\npresently resumed. \u201cHere is another lesson to say nothing,\u201d said he. \u201cI\nam ashamed of my long tongue. Let us make a bargain never to refer to\nthis again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith all my heart,\u201d said the lawyer. \u201cI shake hands on that, Richard.\u201d\n\n\n\nSEARCH FOR MR. HYDE\n\nThat evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre\nspirits and sat down to dinner without relish. It was his custom of a\nSunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume of\nsome dry divinity on his reading desk, until the clock of the\nneighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when he would go\nsoberly and gratefully to bed. On this night however, as soon as the\ncloth was taken away, he took up a candle and went into his business\nroom. There he opened his safe, took from the most private part of it a\ndocument endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekyll\u2019s Will and sat down\nwith a clouded brow to study its contents. The will was holograph, for\nMr. Utterson though he took charge of it now that it was made, had\nrefused to lend the least assistance in the making of it; it provided\nnot only that, in case of the decease of Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L.,\nL.L.D., F.R.S., etc., all his possessions were to pass into the hands\nof his \u201cfriend and benefactor Edward Hyde,\u201d but that in case of Dr.\nJekyll\u2019s \u201cdisappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding\nthree calendar months,\u201d the said Edward Hyde should step into the said\nHenry Jekyll\u2019s shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or\nobligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the\ndoctor\u2019s household. This document had long been the lawyer\u2019s eyesore.\nIt offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and\ncustomary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest. And\nhitherto it was his ignorance of Mr. Hyde that had swelled his\nindignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was his knowledge. It was\nalready bad enough when the name was but a name of which he could learn\nno more. It was worse when it began to be clothed upon with detestable\nattributes; and out of the shifting, insubstantial mists that had so\nlong baffled his eye, there leaped up the sudden, definite presentment\nof a fiend.\n\n\u201cI thought it was madness,\u201d he said, as he replaced the obnoxious paper\nin the safe, \u201cand now I begin to fear it is disgrace.\u201d\n\nWith that he blew out his candle, put on a greatcoat, and set forth in\nthe direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of medicine, where his\nfriend, the great Dr. Lanyon, had his house and received his crowding\npatients. \u201cIf anyone knows, it will be Lanyon,\u201d he had thought.\n\nThe solemn butler knew and welcomed him; he was subjected to no stage\nof delay, but ushered direct from the door to the dining-room where Dr.\nLanyon sat alone over his wine. This was a hearty, healthy, dapper,\nred-faced gentleman, with a shock of hair prematurely white, and a\nboisterous and decided manner. At sight of Mr. Utterson, he sprang up\nfrom his chair and welcomed him with both hands. The geniality, as was\nthe way of the man, was somewhat theatrical to the eye; but it reposed\non genuine feeling. For these two were old friends, old mates both at\nschool and college, both thorough respectors of themselves and of each\nother, and what does not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed each\nother\u2019s company.\n\nAfter a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject which so\ndisagreeably preoccupied his mind.\n\n\u201cI suppose, Lanyon,\u201d said he, \u201cyou and I must be the two oldest friends\nthat Henry Jekyll has?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish the friends were younger,\u201d chuckled Dr. Lanyon. \u201cBut I suppose\nwe are. And what of that? I see little of him now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed?\u201d said Utterson. \u201cI thought you had a bond of common interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had,\u201d was the reply. \u201cBut it is more than ten years since Henry\nJekyll became too fanciful for me. He began to go wrong, wrong in mind;\nand though of course I continue to take an interest in him for old\nsake\u2019s sake, as they say, I see and I have seen devilish little of the\nman. Such unscientific balderdash,\u201d added the doctor, flushing suddenly\npurple, \u201cwould have estranged Damon and Pythias.\u201d\n\nThis little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr. Utterson.\n\u201cThey have only differed on some point of science,\u201d he thought; and\nbeing a man of no scientific passions (except in the matter of\nconveyancing), he even added: \u201cIt is nothing worse than that!\u201d He gave\nhis friend a few seconds to recover his composure, and then approached\nthe question he had come to put. \u201cDid you ever come across a _prot\u00e9g\u00e9_\nof his\u2014one Hyde?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cHyde?\u201d repeated Lanyon. \u201cNo. Never heard of him. Since my time.\u201d\n\nThat was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back with\nhim to the great, dark bed on which he tossed to and fro, until the\nsmall hours of the morning began to grow large. It was a night of\nlittle ease to his toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness and besieged\nby questions.\n\nSix o\u2019clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently\nnear to Mr. Utterson\u2019s dwelling, and still he was digging at the\nproblem. Hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side alone;\nbut now his imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved; and as he\nlay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained\nroom, Mr. Enfield\u2019s tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted\npictures. He would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal\ncity; then of the figure of a man walking swiftly; then of a child\nrunning from the doctor\u2019s; and then these met, and that human\nJuggernaut trod the child down and passed on regardless of her screams.\nOr else he would see a room in a rich house, where his friend lay\nasleep, dreaming and smiling at his dreams; and then the door of that\nroom would be opened, the curtains of the bed plucked apart, the\nsleeper recalled, and lo! there would stand by his side a figure to\nwhom power was given, and even at that dead hour, he must rise and do\nits bidding. The figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer all\nnight; and if at any time he dozed over, it was but to see it glide\nmore stealthily through sleeping houses, or move the more swiftly and\nstill the more swiftly, even to dizziness, through wider labyrinths of\nlamplighted city, and at every street corner crush a child and leave\nher screaming. And still the figure had no face by which he might know\nit; even in his dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled him and\nmelted before his eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and grew\napace in the lawyer\u2019s mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate,\ncuriosity to behold the features of the real Mr. Hyde. If he could but\nonce set eyes on him, he thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps\nroll altogether away, as was the habit of mysterious things when well\nexamined. He might see a reason for his friend\u2019s strange preference or\nbondage (call it which you please) and even for the startling clause of\nthe will. At least it would be a face worth seeing: the face of a man\nwho was without bowels of mercy: a face which had but to show itself to\nraise up, in the mind of the unimpressionable Enfield, a spirit of\nenduring hatred.\n\nFrom that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in the\nby-street of shops. In the morning before office hours, at noon when\nbusiness was plenty and time scarce, at night under the face of the\nfogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or\nconcourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post.\n\n\u201cIf he be Mr. Hyde,\u201d he had thought, \u201cI shall be Mr. Seek.\u201d\n\nAnd at last his patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night; frost\nin the air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps,\nunshaken by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow. By\nten o\u2019clock, when the shops were closed, the by-street was very\nsolitary and, in spite of the low growl of London from all round, very\nsilent. Small sounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houses\nwere clearly audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of\nthe approach of any passenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Utterson\nhad been some minutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd light\nfootstep drawing near. In the course of his nightly patrols, he had\nlong grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of\na single person, while he is still a great way off, suddenly spring out\ndistinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city. Yet his attention\nhad never before been so sharply and decisively arrested; and it was\nwith a strong, superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into\nthe entry of the court.\n\nThe steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as they\nturned the end of the street. The lawyer, looking forth from the entry,\ncould soon see what manner of man he had to deal with. He was small and\nvery plainly dressed and the look of him, even at that distance, went\nsomehow strongly against the watcher\u2019s inclination. But he made\nstraight for the door, crossing the roadway to save time; and as he\ncame, he drew a key from his pocket like one approaching home.\n\nMr. Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed.\n\u201cMr. Hyde, I think?\u201d\n\nMr. Hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath. But his fear\nwas only momentary; and though he did not look the lawyer in the face,\nhe answered coolly enough: \u201cThat is my name. What do you want?\u201d\n\n\u201cI see you are going in,\u201d returned the lawyer. \u201cI am an old friend of\nDr. Jekyll\u2019s\u2014Mr. Utterson of Gaunt Street\u2014you must have heard of my\nname; and meeting you so conveniently, I thought you might admit me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will not find Dr. Jekyll; he is from home,\u201d replied Mr. Hyde,\nblowing in the key. And then suddenly, but still without looking up,\n\u201cHow did you know me?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cOn your side,\u201d said Mr. Utterson \u201cwill you do me a favour?\u201d\n\n\u201cWith pleasure,\u201d replied the other. \u201cWhat shall it be?\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you let me see your face?\u201d asked the lawyer.\n\nMr. Hyde appeared to hesitate, and then, as if upon some sudden\nreflection, fronted about with an air of defiance; and the pair stared\nat each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds. \u201cNow I shall know you\nagain,\u201d said Mr. Utterson. \u201cIt may be useful.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d returned Mr. Hyde, \u201cit is as well we have met; and _\u00e0 propos_,\nyou should have my address.\u201d And he gave a number of a street in Soho.\n\n\u201cGood God!\u201d thought Mr. Utterson, \u201ccan he, too, have been thinking of\nthe will?\u201d But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in\nacknowledgment of the address.\n\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d said the other, \u201chow did you know me?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy description,\u201d was the reply.\n\n\u201cWhose description?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have common friends,\u201d said Mr. Utterson.\n\n\u201cCommon friends,\u201d echoed Mr. Hyde, a little hoarsely. \u201cWho are they?\u201d\n\n\u201cJekyll, for instance,\u201d said the lawyer.\n\n\u201cHe never told you,\u201d cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger. \u201cI did not\nthink you would have lied.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome,\u201d said Mr. Utterson, \u201cthat is not fitting language.\u201d\n\nThe other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment, with\nextraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and disappeared into\nthe house.\n\nThe lawyer stood awhile when Mr. Hyde had left him, the picture of\ndisquietude. Then he began slowly to mount the street, pausing every\nstep or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in mental\nperplexity. The problem he was thus debating as he walked, was one of a\nclass that is rarely solved. Mr. Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave an\nimpression of deformity without any nameable malformation, he had a\ndispleasing smile, he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of\nmurderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and he spoke with a husky,\nwhispering and somewhat broken voice; all these were points against\nhim, but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown\ndisgust, loathing and fear with which Mr. Utterson regarded him. \u201cThere\nmust be something else,\u201d said the perplexed gentleman. \u201cThere _is_\nsomething more, if I could find a name for it. God bless me, the man\nseems hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall we say? or can it be\nthe old story of Dr. Fell? or is it the mere radiance of a foul soul\nthat thus transpires through, and transfigures, its clay continent? The\nlast, I think; for, O my poor old Harry Jekyll, if ever I read Satan\u2019s\nsignature upon a face, it is on that of your new friend.\u201d\n\nRound the corner from the by-street, there was a square of ancient,\nhandsome houses, now for the most part decayed from their high estate\nand let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men;\nmap-engravers, architects, shady lawyers and the agents of obscure\nenterprises. One house, however, second from the corner, was still\noccupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great air of\nwealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness except for\nthe fanlight, Mr. Utterson stopped and knocked. A well-dressed, elderly\nservant opened the door.\n\n\u201cIs Dr. Jekyll at home, Poole?\u201d asked the lawyer.\n\n\u201cI will see, Mr. Utterson,\u201d said Poole, admitting the visitor, as he\nspoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall paved with flags,\nwarmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright, open fire,\nand furnished with costly cabinets of oak. \u201cWill you wait here by the\nfire, sir? or shall I give you a light in the dining-room?\u201d\n\n\u201cHere, thank you,\u201d said the lawyer, and he drew near and leaned on the\ntall fender. This hall, in which he was now left alone, was a pet fancy\nof his friend the doctor\u2019s; and Utterson himself was wont to speak of\nit as the pleasantest room in London. But tonight there was a shudder\nin his blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his memory; he felt (what\nwas rare with him) a nausea and distaste of life; and in the gloom of\nhis spirits, he seemed to read a menace in the flickering of the\nfirelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the\nshadow on the roof. He was ashamed of his relief, when Poole presently\nreturned to announce that Dr. Jekyll was gone out.\n\n\u201cI saw Mr. Hyde go in by the old dissecting room, Poole,\u201d he said. \u201cIs\nthat right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home?\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite right, Mr. Utterson, sir,\u201d replied the servant. \u201cMr. Hyde has a\nkey.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man,\nPoole,\u201d resumed the other musingly.\n\n\u201cYes, sir, he does indeed,\u201d said Poole. \u201cWe have all orders to obey\nhim.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not think I ever met Mr. Hyde?\u201d asked Utterson.\n\n\u201cO, dear no, sir. He never _dines_ here,\u201d replied the butler. \u201cIndeed\nwe see very little of him on this side of the house; he mostly comes\nand goes by the laboratory.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, good-night, Poole.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood-night, Mr. Utterson.\u201d\n\nAnd the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart. \u201cPoor Harry\nJekyll,\u201d he thought, \u201cmy mind misgives me he is in deep waters! He was\nwild when he was young; a long while ago to be sure; but in the law of\nGod, there is no statute of limitations. Ay, it must be that; the ghost\nof some old sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment\ncoming, _pede claudo_, years after memory has forgotten and self-love\ncondoned the fault.\u201d And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded\nawhile on his own past, groping in all the corners of memory, lest by\nchance some Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to light\nthere. His past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls of\ntheir life with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust by\nthe many ill things he had done, and raised up again into a sober and\nfearful gratitude by the many he had come so near to doing yet avoided.\nAnd then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a spark of\nhope. \u201cThis Master Hyde, if he were studied,\u201d thought he, \u201cmust have\nsecrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of him; secrets compared\nto which poor Jekyll\u2019s worst would be like sunshine. Things cannot\ncontinue as they are. It turns me cold to think of this creature\nstealing like a thief to Harry\u2019s bedside; poor Harry, what a wakening!\nAnd the danger of it; for if this Hyde suspects the existence of the\nwill, he may grow impatient to inherit. Ay, I must put my shoulders to\nthe wheel\u2014if Jekyll will but let me,\u201d he added, \u201cif Jekyll will only\nlet me.\u201d For once more he saw before his mind\u2019s eye, as clear as\ntransparency, the strange clauses of the will.\n\n\n\nDR. JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASE\n\nA fortnight later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one of\nhis pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies, all intelligent,\nreputable men and all judges of good wine; and Mr. Utterson so\ncontrived that he remained behind after the others had departed. This\nwas no new arrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores of\ntimes. Where Utterson was liked, he was liked well. Hosts loved to\ndetain the dry lawyer, when the light-hearted and loose-tongued had\nalready their foot on the threshold; they liked to sit a while in his\nunobtrusive company, practising for solitude, sobering their minds in\nthe man\u2019s rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety. To this\nrule, Dr. Jekyll was no exception; and as he now sat on the opposite\nside of the fire\u2014a large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with\nsomething of a slyish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity and\nkindness\u2014you could see by his looks that he cherished for Mr. Utterson\na sincere and warm affection.\n\n\u201cI have been wanting to speak to you, Jekyll,\u201d began the latter. \u201cYou\nknow that will of yours?\u201d\n\nA close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful;\nbut the doctor carried it off gaily. \u201cMy poor Utterson,\u201d said he, \u201cyou\nare unfortunate in such a client. I never saw a man so distressed as\nyou were by my will; unless it were that hide-bound pedant, Lanyon, at\nwhat he called my scientific heresies. O, I know he\u2019s a good fellow\u2014you\nneedn\u2019t frown\u2014an excellent fellow, and I always mean to see more of\nhim; but a hide-bound pedant for all that; an ignorant, blatant pedant.\nI was never more disappointed in any man than Lanyon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know I never approved of it,\u201d pursued Utterson, ruthlessly\ndisregarding the fresh topic.\n\n\u201cMy will? Yes, certainly, I know that,\u201d said the doctor, a trifle\nsharply. \u201cYou have told me so.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I tell you so again,\u201d continued the lawyer. \u201cI have been\nlearning something of young Hyde.\u201d\n\nThe large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and\nthere came a blackness about his eyes. \u201cI do not care to hear more,\u201d\nsaid he. \u201cThis is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I heard was abominable,\u201d said Utterson.\n\n\u201cIt can make no change. You do not understand my position,\u201d returned\nthe doctor, with a certain incoherency of manner. \u201cI am painfully\nsituated, Utterson; my position is a very strange\u2014a very strange one.\nIt is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking.\u201d\n\n\u201cJekyll,\u201d said Utterson, \u201cyou know me: I am a man to be trusted. Make a\nclean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can get you\nout of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy good Utterson,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cthis is very good of you, this is\ndownright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you in. I\nbelieve you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, before\nmyself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isn\u2019t what you fancy;\nit is not as bad as that; and just to put your good heart at rest, I\nwill tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde.\nI give you my hand upon that; and I thank you again and again; and I\nwill just add one little word, Utterson, that I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll take in\ngood part: this is a private matter, and I beg of you to let it sleep.\u201d\n\nUtterson reflected a little, looking in the fire.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt you are perfectly right,\u201d he said at last, getting to\nhis feet.\n\n\u201cWell, but since we have touched upon this business, and for the last\ntime I hope,\u201d continued the doctor, \u201cthere is one point I should like\nyou to understand. I have really a very great interest in poor Hyde. I\nknow you have seen him; he told me so; and I fear he was rude. But I do\nsincerely take a great, a very great interest in that young man; and if\nI am taken away, Utterson, I wish you to promise me that you will bear\nwith him and get his rights for him. I think you would, if you knew\nall; and it would be a weight off my mind if you would promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t pretend that I shall ever like him,\u201d said the lawyer.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t ask that,\u201d pleaded Jekyll, laying his hand upon the other\u2019s\narm; \u201cI only ask for justice; I only ask you to help him for my sake,\nwhen I am no longer here.\u201d\n\nUtterson heaved an irrepressible sigh. \u201cWell,\u201d said he, \u201cI promise.\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE CAREW MURDER CASE\n\nNearly a year later, in the month of October, 18\u2014, London was startled\nby a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by\nthe high position of the victim. The details were few and startling. A\nmaid servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone\nupstairs to bed about eleven. Although a fog rolled over the city in\nthe small hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the\nlane, which the maid\u2019s window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by the\nfull moon. It seems she was romantically given, for she sat down upon\nher box, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into a\ndream of musing. Never (she used to say, with streaming tears, when she\nnarrated that experience), never had she felt more at peace with all\nmen or thought more kindly of the world. And as she so sat she became\naware of an aged beautiful gentleman with white hair, drawing near\nalong the lane; and advancing to meet him, another and very small\ngentleman, to whom at first she paid less attention. When they had come\nwithin speech (which was just under the maid\u2019s eyes) the older man\nbowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of politeness.\nIt did not seem as if the subject of his address were of great\nimportance; indeed, from his pointing, it sometimes appeared as if he\nwere only inquiring his way; but the moon shone on his face as he\nspoke, and the girl was pleased to watch it, it seemed to breathe such\nan innocent and old-world kindness of disposition, yet with something\nhigh too, as of a well-founded self-content. Presently her eye wandered\nto the other, and she was surprised to recognise in him a certain Mr.\nHyde, who had once visited her master and for whom she had conceived a\ndislike. He had in his hand a heavy cane, with which he was trifling;\nbut he answered never a word, and seemed to listen with an\nill-contained impatience. And then all of a sudden he broke out in a\ngreat flame of anger, stamping with his foot, brandishing the cane, and\ncarrying on (as the maid described it) like a madman. The old gentleman\ntook a step back, with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle\nhurt; and at that Mr. Hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed him to\nthe earth. And next moment, with ape-like fury, he was trampling his\nvictim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows, under which the\nbones were audibly shattered and the body jumped upon the roadway. At\nthe horror of these sights and sounds, the maid fainted.\n\nIt was two o\u2019clock when she came to herself and called for the police.\nThe murderer was gone long ago; but there lay his victim in the middle\nof the lane, incredibly mangled. The stick with which the deed had been\ndone, although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood, had\nbroken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty; and\none splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter\u2014the other,\nwithout doubt, had been carried away by the murderer. A purse and gold\nwatch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except a\nsealed and stamped envelope, which he had been probably carrying to the\npost, and which bore the name and address of Mr. Utterson.\n\nThis was brought to the lawyer the next morning, before he was out of\nbed; and he had no sooner seen it and been told the circumstances, than\nhe shot out a solemn lip. \u201cI shall say nothing till I have seen the\nbody,\u201d said he; \u201cthis may be very serious. Have the kindness to wait\nwhile I dress.\u201d And with the same grave countenance he hurried through\nhis breakfast and drove to the police station, whither the body had\nbeen carried. As soon as he came into the cell, he nodded.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said he, \u201cI recognise him. I am sorry to say that this is Sir\nDanvers Carew.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood God, sir,\u201d exclaimed the officer, \u201cis it possible?\u201d And the next\nmoment his eye lighted up with professional ambition. \u201cThis will make a\ndeal of noise,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd perhaps you can help us to the man.\u201d And\nhe briefly narrated what the maid had seen, and showed the broken\nstick.\n\nMr. Utterson had already quailed at the name of Hyde; but when the\nstick was laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken and\nbattered as it was, he recognised it for one that he had himself\npresented many years before to Henry Jekyll.\n\n\u201cIs this Mr. Hyde a person of small stature?\u201d he inquired.\n\n\u201cParticularly small and particularly wicked-looking, is what the maid\ncalls him,\u201d said the officer.\n\nMr. Utterson reflected; and then, raising his head, \u201cIf you will come\nwith me in my cab,\u201d he said, \u201cI think I can take you to his house.\u201d\n\nIt was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of the\nseason. A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but the\nwind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours; so\nthat as the cab crawled from street to street, Mr. Utterson beheld a\nmarvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight; for here it would be\ndark like the back-end of evening; and there would be a glow of a rich,\nlurid brown, like the light of some strange conflagration; and here,\nfor a moment, the fog would be quite broken up, and a haggard shaft of\ndaylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths. The dismal\nquarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses, with its muddy\nways, and slatternly passengers, and its lamps, which had never been\nextinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful\nreinvasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyer\u2019s eyes, like a district\nof some city in a nightmare. The thoughts of his mind, besides, were of\nthe gloomiest dye; and when he glanced at the companion of his drive,\nhe was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law\u2019s\nofficers, which may at times assail the most honest.\n\nAs the cab drew up before the address indicated, the fog lifted a\nlittle and showed him a dingy street, a gin palace, a low French eating\nhouse, a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads, many\nragged children huddled in the doorways, and many women of many\ndifferent nationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a morning\nglass; and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part,\nas brown as umber, and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings.\nThis was the home of Henry Jekyll\u2019s favourite; of a man who was heir to\na quarter of a million sterling.\n\nAn ivory-faced and silvery-haired old woman opened the door. She had an\nevil face, smoothed by hypocrisy: but her manners were excellent. Yes,\nshe said, this was Mr. Hyde\u2019s, but he was not at home; he had been in\nthat night very late, but he had gone away again in less than an hour;\nthere was nothing strange in that; his habits were very irregular, and\nhe was often absent; for instance, it was nearly two months since she\nhad seen him till yesterday.\n\n\u201cVery well, then, we wish to see his rooms,\u201d said the lawyer; and when\nthe woman began to declare it was impossible, \u201cI had better tell you\nwho this person is,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is Inspector Newcomen of Scotland\nYard.\u201d\n\nA flash of odious joy appeared upon the woman\u2019s face. \u201cAh!\u201d said she,\n\u201che is in trouble! What has he done?\u201d\n\nMr. Utterson and the inspector exchanged glances. \u201cHe don\u2019t seem a very\npopular character,\u201d observed the latter. \u201cAnd now, my good woman, just\nlet me and this gentleman have a look about us.\u201d\n\nIn the whole extent of the house, which but for the old woman remained\notherwise empty, Mr. Hyde had only used a couple of rooms; but these\nwere furnished with luxury and good taste. A closet was filled with\nwine; the plate was of silver, the napery elegant; a good picture hung\nupon the walls, a gift (as Utterson supposed) from Henry Jekyll, who\nwas much of a connoisseur; and the carpets were of many plies and\nagreeable in colour. At this moment, however, the rooms bore every mark\nof having been recently and hurriedly ransacked; clothes lay about the\nfloor, with their pockets inside out; lock-fast drawers stood open; and\non the hearth there lay a pile of grey ashes, as though many papers had\nbeen burned. From these embers the inspector disinterred the butt end\nof a green cheque book, which had resisted the action of the fire; the\nother half of the stick was found behind the door; and as this clinched\nhis suspicions, the officer declared himself delighted. A visit to the\nbank, where several thousand pounds were found to be lying to the\nmurderer\u2019s credit, completed his gratification.\n\n\u201cYou may depend upon it, sir,\u201d he told Mr. Utterson: \u201cI have him in my\nhand. He must have lost his head, or he never would have left the stick\nor, above all, burned the cheque book. Why, money\u2019s life to the man. We\nhave nothing to do but wait for him at the bank, and get out the\nhandbills.\u201d\n\nThis last, however, was not so easy of accomplishment; for Mr. Hyde had\nnumbered few familiars\u2014even the master of the servant maid had only\nseen him twice; his family could nowhere be traced; he had never been\nphotographed; and the few who could describe him differed widely, as\ncommon observers will. Only on one point were they agreed; and that was\nthe haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitive\nimpressed his beholders.\n\n\n\nINCIDENT OF THE LETTER\n\nIt was late in the afternoon, when Mr. Utterson found his way to Dr.\nJekyll\u2019s door, where he was at once admitted by Poole, and carried down\nby the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden,\nto the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or\ndissecting rooms. The doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a\ncelebrated surgeon; and his own tastes being rather chemical than\nanatomical, had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of\nthe garden. It was the first time that the lawyer had been received in\nthat part of his friend\u2019s quarters; and he eyed the dingy, windowless\nstructure with curiosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense of\nstrangeness as he crossed the theatre, once crowded with eager students\nand now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemical\napparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing\nstraw, and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola. At the\nfurther end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red\nbaize; and through this, Mr. Utterson was at last received into the\ndoctor\u2019s cabinet. It was a large room fitted round with glass presses,\nfurnished, among other things, with a cheval-glass and a business\ntable, and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred\nwith iron. The fire burned in the grate; a lamp was set lighted on the\nchimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly; and\nthere, close up to the warmth, sat Dr. Jekyll, looking deathly sick. He\ndid not rise to meet his visitor, but held out a cold hand and bade him\nwelcome in a changed voice.\n\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d said Mr. Utterson, as soon as Poole had left them, \u201cyou have\nheard the news?\u201d\n\nThe doctor shuddered. \u201cThey were crying it in the square,\u201d he said. \u201cI\nheard them in my dining-room.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne word,\u201d said the lawyer. \u201cCarew was my client, but so are you, and\nI want to know what I am doing. You have not been mad enough to hide\nthis fellow?\u201d\n\n\u201cUtterson, I swear to God,\u201d cried the doctor, \u201cI swear to God I will\nnever set eyes on him again. I bind my honour to you that I am done\nwith him in this world. It is all at an end. And indeed he does not\nwant my help; you do not know him as I do; he is safe, he is quite\nsafe; mark my words, he will never more be heard of.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer listened gloomily; he did not like his friend\u2019s feverish\nmanner. \u201cYou seem pretty sure of him,\u201d said he; \u201cand for your sake, I\nhope you may be right. If it came to a trial, your name might appear.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am quite sure of him,\u201d replied Jekyll; \u201cI have grounds for certainty\nthat I cannot share with any one. But there is one thing on which you\nmay advise me. I have\u2014I have received a letter; and I am at a loss\nwhether I should show it to the police. I should like to leave it in\nyour hands, Utterson; you would judge wisely, I am sure; I have so\ngreat a trust in you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou fear, I suppose, that it might lead to his detection?\u201d asked the\nlawyer.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the other. \u201cI cannot say that I care what becomes of Hyde; I\nam quite done with him. I was thinking of my own character, which this\nhateful business has rather exposed.\u201d\n\nUtterson ruminated awhile; he was surprised at his friend\u2019s\nselfishness, and yet relieved by it. \u201cWell,\u201d said he, at last, \u201clet me\nsee the letter.\u201d\n\nThe letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed \u201cEdward\nHyde\u201d: and it signified, briefly enough, that the writer\u2019s benefactor,\nDr. Jekyll, whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand\ngenerosities, need labour under no alarm for his safety, as he had\nmeans of escape on which he placed a sure dependence. The lawyer liked\nthis letter well enough; it put a better colour on the intimacy than he\nhad looked for; and he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions.\n\n\u201cHave you the envelope?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI burned it,\u201d replied Jekyll, \u201cbefore I thought what I was about. But\nit bore no postmark. The note was handed in.\u201d\n\n\u201cShall I keep this and sleep upon it?\u201d asked Utterson.\n\n\u201cI wish you to judge for me entirely,\u201d was the reply. \u201cI have lost\nconfidence in myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I shall consider,\u201d returned the lawyer. \u201cAnd now one word more:\nit was Hyde who dictated the terms in your will about that\ndisappearance?\u201d\n\nThe doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness; he shut his mouth\ntight and nodded.\n\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d said Utterson. \u201cHe meant to murder you. You had a fine\nescape.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have had what is far more to the purpose,\u201d returned the doctor\nsolemnly: \u201cI have had a lesson\u2014O God, Utterson, what a lesson I have\nhad!\u201d And he covered his face for a moment with his hands.\n\nOn his way out, the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with Poole.\n\u201cBy the bye,\u201d said he, \u201cthere was a letter handed in to-day: what was\nthe messenger like?\u201d But Poole was positive nothing had come except by\npost; \u201cand only circulars by that,\u201d he added.\n\nThis news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed. Plainly the\nletter had come by the laboratory door; possibly, indeed, it had been\nwritten in the cabinet; and if that were so, it must be differently\njudged, and handled with the more caution. The newsboys, as he went,\nwere crying themselves hoarse along the footways: \u201cSpecial edition.\nShocking murder of an M.P.\u201d That was the funeral oration of one friend\nand client; and he could not help a certain apprehension lest the good\nname of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal. It\nwas, at least, a ticklish decision that he had to make; and\nself-reliant as he was by habit, he began to cherish a longing for\nadvice. It was not to be had directly; but perhaps, he thought, it\nmight be fished for.\n\nPresently after, he sat on one side of his own hearth, with Mr. Guest,\nhis head clerk, upon the other, and midway between, at a nicely\ncalculated distance from the fire, a bottle of a particular old wine\nthat had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of his house. The fog\nstill slept on the wing above the drowned city, where the lamps\nglimmered like carbuncles; and through the muffle and smother of these\nfallen clouds, the procession of the town\u2019s life was still rolling in\nthrough the great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind. But the\nroom was gay with firelight. In the bottle the acids were long ago\nresolved; the imperial dye had softened with time, as the colour grows\nricher in stained windows; and the glow of hot autumn afternoons on\nhillside vineyards, was ready to be set free and to disperse the fogs\nof London. Insensibly the lawyer melted. There was no man from whom he\nkept fewer secrets than Mr. Guest; and he was not always sure that he\nkept as many as he meant. Guest had often been on business to the\ndoctor\u2019s; he knew Poole; he could scarce have failed to hear of Mr.\nHyde\u2019s familiarity about the house; he might draw conclusions: was it\nnot as well, then, that he should see a letter which put that mystery\nto right? and above all since Guest, being a great student and critic\nof handwriting, would consider the step natural and obliging? The\nclerk, besides, was a man of counsel; he could scarce read so strange a\ndocument without dropping a remark; and by that remark Mr. Utterson\nmight shape his future course.\n\n\u201cThis is a sad business about Sir Danvers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYes, sir, indeed. It has elicited a great deal of public feeling,\u201d\nreturned Guest. \u201cThe man, of course, was mad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should like to hear your views on that,\u201d replied Utterson. \u201cI have a\ndocument here in his handwriting; it is between ourselves, for I scarce\nknow what to do about it; it is an ugly business at the best. But there\nit is; quite in your way: a murderer\u2019s autograph.\u201d\n\nGuest\u2019s eyes brightened, and he sat down at once and studied it with\npassion. \u201cNo sir,\u201d he said: \u201cnot mad; but it is an odd hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd by all accounts a very odd writer,\u201d added the lawyer.\n\nJust then the servant entered with a note.\n\n\u201cIs that from Dr. Jekyll, sir?\u201d inquired the clerk. \u201cI thought I knew\nthe writing. Anything private, Mr. Utterson?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly an invitation to dinner. Why? Do you want to see it?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne moment. I thank you, sir;\u201d and the clerk laid the two sheets of\npaper alongside and sedulously compared their contents. \u201cThank you,\nsir,\u201d he said at last, returning both; \u201cit\u2019s a very interesting\nautograph.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause, during which Mr. Utterson struggled with himself.\n\u201cWhy did you compare them, Guest?\u201d he inquired suddenly.\n\n\u201cWell, sir,\u201d returned the clerk, \u201cthere\u2019s a rather singular\nresemblance; the two hands are in many points identical: only\ndifferently sloped.\u201d\n\n\u201cRather quaint,\u201d said Utterson.\n\n\u201cIt is, as you say, rather quaint,\u201d returned Guest.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t speak of this note, you know,\u201d said the master.\n\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d said the clerk. \u201cI understand.\u201d\n\nBut no sooner was Mr. Utterson alone that night, than he locked the\nnote into his safe, where it reposed from that time forward. \u201cWhat!\u201d he\nthought. \u201cHenry Jekyll forge for a murderer!\u201d And his blood ran cold in\nhis veins.\n\n\n\nINCIDENT OF DR. LANYON\n\nTime ran on; thousands of pounds were offered in reward, for the death\nof Sir Danvers was resented as a public injury; but Mr. Hyde had\ndisappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had never\nexisted. Much of his past was unearthed, indeed, and all disreputable:\ntales came out of the man\u2019s cruelty, at once so callous and violent; of\nhis vile life, of his strange associates, of the hatred that seemed to\nhave surrounded his career; but of his present whereabouts, not a\nwhisper. From the time he had left the house in Soho on the morning of\nthe murder, he was simply blotted out; and gradually, as time drew on,\nMr. Utterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm, and to\ngrow more at quiet with himself. The death of Sir Danvers was, to his\nway of thinking, more than paid for by the disappearance of Mr. Hyde.\nNow that that evil influence had been withdrawn, a new life began for\nDr. Jekyll. He came out of his seclusion, renewed relations with his\nfriends, became once more their familiar guest and entertainer; and\nwhilst he had always been known for charities, he was now no less\ndistinguished for religion. He was busy, he was much in the open air,\nhe did good; his face seemed to open and brighten, as if with an inward\nconsciousness of service; and for more than two months, the doctor was\nat peace.\n\nOn the 8th of January Utterson had dined at the doctor\u2019s with a small\nparty; Lanyon had been there; and the face of the host had looked from\none to the other as in the old days when the trio were inseparable\nfriends. On the 12th, and again on the 14th, the door was shut against\nthe lawyer. \u201cThe doctor was confined to the house,\u201d Poole said, \u201cand\nsaw no one.\u201d On the 15th, he tried again, and was again refused; and\nhaving now been used for the last two months to see his friend almost\ndaily, he found this return of solitude to weigh upon his spirits. The\nfifth night he had in Guest to dine with him; and the sixth he betook\nhimself to Dr. Lanyon\u2019s.\n\nThere at least he was not denied admittance; but when he came in, he\nwas shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctor\u2019s\nappearance. He had his death-warrant written legibly upon his face. The\nrosy man had grown pale; his flesh had fallen away; he was visibly\nbalder and older; and yet it was not so much these tokens of a swift\nphysical decay that arrested the lawyer\u2019s notice, as a look in the eye\nand quality of manner that seemed to testify to some deep-seated terror\nof the mind. It was unlikely that the doctor should fear death; and yet\nthat was what Utterson was tempted to suspect. \u201cYes,\u201d he thought; \u201che\nis a doctor, he must know his own state and that his days are counted;\nand the knowledge is more than he can bear.\u201d And yet when Utterson\nremarked on his ill looks, it was with an air of great firmness that\nLanyon declared himself a doomed man.\n\n\u201cI have had a shock,\u201d he said, \u201cand I shall never recover. It is a\nquestion of weeks. Well, life has been pleasant; I liked it; yes, sir,\nI used to like it. I sometimes think if we knew all, we should be more\nglad to get away.\u201d\n\n\u201cJekyll is ill, too,\u201d observed Utterson. \u201cHave you seen him?\u201d\n\nBut Lanyon\u2019s face changed, and he held up a trembling hand. \u201cI wish to\nsee or hear no more of Dr. Jekyll,\u201d he said in a loud, unsteady voice.\n\u201cI am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will spare me any\nallusion to one whom I regard as dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cTut, tut!\u201d said Mr. Utterson; and then after a considerable pause,\n\u201cCan\u2019t I do anything?\u201d he inquired. \u201cWe are three very old friends,\nLanyon; we shall not live to make others.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing can be done,\u201d returned Lanyon; \u201cask himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will not see me,\u201d said the lawyer.\n\n\u201cI am not surprised at that,\u201d was the reply. \u201cSome day, Utterson, after\nI am dead, you may perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this. I\ncannot tell you. And in the meantime, if you can sit and talk with me\nof other things, for God\u2019s sake, stay and do so; but if you cannot keep\nclear of this accursed topic, then in God\u2019s name, go, for I cannot bear\nit.\u201d\n\nAs soon as he got home, Utterson sat down and wrote to Jekyll,\ncomplaining of his exclusion from the house, and asking the cause of\nthis unhappy break with Lanyon; and the next day brought him a long\nanswer, often very pathetically worded, and sometimes darkly mysterious\nin drift. The quarrel with Lanyon was incurable. \u201cI do not blame our\nold friend,\u201d Jekyll wrote, \u201cbut I share his view that we must never\nmeet. I mean from henceforth to lead a life of extreme seclusion; you\nmust not be surprised, nor must you doubt my friendship, if my door is\noften shut even to you. You must suffer me to go my own dark way. I\nhave brought on myself a punishment and a danger that I cannot name. If\nI am the chief of sinners, I am the chief of sufferers also. I could\nnot think that this earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors\nso unmanning; and you can do but one thing, Utterson, to lighten this\ndestiny, and that is to respect my silence.\u201d Utterson was amazed; the\ndark influence of Hyde had been withdrawn, the doctor had returned to\nhis old tasks and amities; a week ago, the prospect had smiled with\nevery promise of a cheerful and an honoured age; and now in a moment,\nfriendship, and peace of mind, and the whole tenor of his life were\nwrecked. So great and unprepared a change pointed to madness; but in\nview of Lanyon\u2019s manner and words, there must lie for it some deeper\nground.\n\nA week afterwards Dr. Lanyon took to his bed, and in something less\nthan a fortnight he was dead. The night after the funeral, at which he\nhad been sadly affected, Utterson locked the door of his business room,\nand sitting there by the light of a melancholy candle, drew out and set\nbefore him an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with the seal\nof his dead friend. \u201cPRIVATE: for the hands of G. J. Utterson ALONE,\nand in case of his predecease _to be destroyed unread_,\u201d so it was\nemphatically superscribed; and the lawyer dreaded to behold the\ncontents. \u201cI have buried one friend to-day,\u201d he thought: \u201cwhat if this\nshould cost me another?\u201d And then he condemned the fear as a\ndisloyalty, and broke the seal. Within there was another enclosure,\nlikewise sealed, and marked upon the cover as \u201cnot to be opened till\nthe death or disappearance of Dr. Henry Jekyll.\u201d Utterson could not\ntrust his eyes. Yes, it was disappearance; here again, as in the mad\nwill which he had long ago restored to its author, here again were the\nidea of a disappearance and the name of Henry Jekyll bracketted. But in\nthe will, that idea had sprung from the sinister suggestion of the man\nHyde; it was set there with a purpose all too plain and horrible.\nWritten by the hand of Lanyon, what should it mean? A great curiosity\ncame on the trustee, to disregard the prohibition and dive at once to\nthe bottom of these mysteries; but professional honour and faith to his\ndead friend were stringent obligations; and the packet slept in the\ninmost corner of his private safe.\n\nIt is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and it may\nbe doubted if, from that day forth, Utterson desired the society of his\nsurviving friend with the same eagerness. He thought of him kindly; but\nhis thoughts were disquieted and fearful. He went to call indeed; but\nhe was perhaps relieved to be denied admittance; perhaps, in his heart,\nhe preferred to speak with Poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by\nthe air and sounds of the open city, rather than to be admitted into\nthat house of voluntary bondage, and to sit and speak with its\ninscrutable recluse. Poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news to\ncommunicate. The doctor, it appeared, now more than ever confined\nhimself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he would sometimes\neven sleep; he was out of spirits, he had grown very silent, he did not\nread; it seemed as if he had something on his mind. Utterson became so\nused to the unvarying character of these reports, that he fell off\nlittle by little in the frequency of his visits.\n\n\n\nINCIDENT AT THE WINDOW\n\nIt chanced on Sunday, when Mr. Utterson was on his usual walk with Mr.\nEnfield, that their way lay once again through the by-street; and that\nwhen they came in front of the door, both stopped to gaze on it.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Enfield, \u201cthat story\u2019s at an end at least. We shall never\nsee more of Mr. Hyde.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope not,\u201d said Utterson. \u201cDid I ever tell you that I once saw him,\nand shared your feeling of repulsion?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was impossible to do the one without the other,\u201d returned Enfield.\n\u201cAnd by the way, what an ass you must have thought me, not to know that\nthis was a back way to Dr. Jekyll\u2019s! It was partly your own fault that\nI found it out, even when I did.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you found it out, did you?\u201d said Utterson. \u201cBut if that be so, we\nmay step into the court and take a look at the windows. To tell you the\ntruth, I am uneasy about poor Jekyll; and even outside, I feel as if\nthe presence of a friend might do him good.\u201d\n\nThe court was very cool and a little damp, and full of premature\ntwilight, although the sky, high up overhead, was still bright with\nsunset. The middle one of the three windows was half-way open; and\nsitting close beside it, taking the air with an infinite sadness of\nmien, like some disconsolate prisoner, Utterson saw Dr. Jekyll.\n\n\u201cWhat! Jekyll!\u201d he cried. \u201cI trust you are better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very low, Utterson,\u201d replied the doctor drearily, \u201cvery low. It\nwill not last long, thank God.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou stay too much indoors,\u201d said the lawyer. \u201cYou should be out,\nwhipping up the circulation like Mr. Enfield and me. (This is my\ncousin\u2014Mr. Enfield\u2014Dr. Jekyll.) Come now; get your hat and take a quick\nturn with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are very good,\u201d sighed the other. \u201cI should like to very much; but\nno, no, no, it is quite impossible; I dare not. But indeed, Utterson, I\nam very glad to see you; this is really a great pleasure; I would ask\nyou and Mr. Enfield up, but the place is really not fit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, then,\u201d said the lawyer, good-naturedly, \u201cthe best thing we can do\nis to stay down here and speak with you from where we are.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is just what I was about to venture to propose,\u201d returned the\ndoctor with a smile. But the words were hardly uttered, before the\nsmile was struck out of his face and succeeded by an expression of such\nabject terror and despair, as froze the very blood of the two gentlemen\nbelow. They saw it but for a glimpse for the window was instantly\nthrust down; but that glimpse had been sufficient, and they turned and\nleft the court without a word. In silence, too, they traversed the\nby-street; and it was not until they had come into a neighbouring\nthoroughfare, where even upon a Sunday there were still some stirrings\nof life, that Mr. Utterson at last turned and looked at his companion.\nThey were both pale; and there was an answering horror in their eyes.\n\n\u201cGod forgive us, God forgive us,\u201d said Mr. Utterson.\n\nBut Mr. Enfield only nodded his head very seriously, and walked on once\nmore in silence.\n\n\n\nTHE LAST NIGHT\n\nMr. Utterson was sitting by his fireside one evening after dinner, when\nhe was surprised to receive a visit from Poole.\n\n\u201cBless me, Poole, what brings you here?\u201d he cried; and then taking a\nsecond look at him, \u201cWhat ails you?\u201d he added; \u201cis the doctor ill?\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Utterson,\u201d said the man, \u201cthere is something wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you,\u201d said the lawyer.\n\u201cNow, take your time, and tell me plainly what you want.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know the doctor\u2019s ways, sir,\u201d replied Poole, \u201cand how he shuts\nhimself up. Well, he\u2019s shut up again in the cabinet; and I don\u2019t like\nit, sir\u2014I wish I may die if I like it. Mr. Utterson, sir, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, my good man,\u201d said the lawyer, \u201cbe explicit. What are you afraid\nof?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been afraid for about a week,\u201d returned Poole, doggedly\ndisregarding the question, \u201cand I can bear it no more.\u201d\n\nThe man\u2019s appearance amply bore out his words; his manner was altered\nfor the worse; and except for the moment when he had first announced\nhis terror, he had not once looked the lawyer in the face. Even now, he\nsat with the glass of wine untasted on his knee, and his eyes directed\nto a corner of the floor. \u201cI can bear it no more,\u201d he repeated.\n\n\u201cCome,\u201d said the lawyer, \u201cI see you have some good reason, Poole; I see\nthere is something seriously amiss. Try to tell me what it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s been foul play,\u201d said Poole, hoarsely.\n\n\u201cFoul play!\u201d cried the lawyer, a good deal frightened and rather\ninclined to be irritated in consequence. \u201cWhat foul play! What does the\nman mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cI daren\u2019t say, sir,\u201d was the answer; \u201cbut will you come along with me\nand see for yourself?\u201d\n\nMr. Utterson\u2019s only answer was to rise and get his hat and greatcoat;\nbut he observed with wonder the greatness of the relief that appeared\nupon the butler\u2019s face, and perhaps with no less, that the wine was\nstill untasted when he set it down to follow.\n\nIt was a wild, cold, seasonable night of March, with a pale moon, lying\non her back as though the wind had tilted her, and flying wrack of the\nmost diaphanous and lawny texture. The wind made talking difficult, and\nflecked the blood into the face. It seemed to have swept the streets\nunusually bare of passengers, besides; for Mr. Utterson thought he had\nnever seen that part of London so deserted. He could have wished it\notherwise; never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a wish\nto see and touch his fellow-creatures; for struggle as he might, there\nwas borne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity. The\nsquare, when they got there, was full of wind and dust, and the thin\ntrees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railing. Poole,\nwho had kept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled up in the\nmiddle of the pavement, and in spite of the biting weather, took off\nhis hat and mopped his brow with a red pocket-handkerchief. But for all\nthe hurry of his coming, these were not the dews of exertion that he\nwiped away, but the moisture of some strangling anguish; for his face\nwas white and his voice, when he spoke, harsh and broken.\n\n\u201cWell, sir,\u201d he said, \u201chere we are, and God grant there be nothing\nwrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmen, Poole,\u201d said the lawyer.\n\nThereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner; the door was\nopened on the chain; and a voice asked from within, \u201cIs that you,\nPoole?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d said Poole. \u201cOpen the door.\u201d\n\nThe hall, when they entered it, was brightly lighted up; the fire was\nbuilt high; and about the hearth the whole of the servants, men and\nwomen, stood huddled together like a flock of sheep. At the sight of\nMr. Utterson, the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering; and the\ncook, crying out \u201cBless God! it\u2019s Mr. Utterson,\u201d ran forward as if to\ntake him in her arms.\n\n\u201cWhat, what? Are you all here?\u201d said the lawyer peevishly. \u201cVery\nirregular, very unseemly; your master would be far from pleased.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all afraid,\u201d said Poole.\n\nBlank silence followed, no one protesting; only the maid lifted her\nvoice and now wept loudly.\n\n\u201cHold your tongue!\u201d Poole said to her, with a ferocity of accent that\ntestified to his own jangled nerves; and indeed, when the girl had so\nsuddenly raised the note of her lamentation, they had all started and\nturned towards the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation. \u201cAnd\nnow,\u201d continued the butler, addressing the knife-boy, \u201creach me a\ncandle, and we\u2019ll get this through hands at once.\u201d And then he begged\nMr. Utterson to follow him, and led the way to the back garden.\n\n\u201cNow, sir,\u201d said he, \u201cyou come as gently as you can. I want you to\nhear, and I don\u2019t want you to be heard. And see here, sir, if by any\nchance he was to ask you in, don\u2019t go.\u201d\n\nMr. Utterson\u2019s nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a jerk\nthat nearly threw him from his balance; but he recollected his courage\nand followed the butler into the laboratory building through the\nsurgical theatre, with its lumber of crates and bottles, to the foot of\nthe stair. Here Poole motioned him to stand on one side and listen;\nwhile he himself, setting down the candle and making a great and\nobvious call on his resolution, mounted the steps and knocked with a\nsomewhat uncertain hand on the red baize of the cabinet door.\n\n\u201cMr. Utterson, sir, asking to see you,\u201d he called; and even as he did\nso, once more violently signed to the lawyer to give ear.\n\nA voice answered from within: \u201cTell him I cannot see anyone,\u201d it said\ncomplainingly.\n\n\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d said Poole, with a note of something like triumph in\nhis voice; and taking up his candle, he led Mr. Utterson back across\nthe yard and into the great kitchen, where the fire was out and the\nbeetles were leaping on the floor.\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d he said, looking Mr. Utterson in the eyes, \u201cWas that my master\u2019s\nvoice?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems much changed,\u201d replied the lawyer, very pale, but giving look\nfor look.\n\n\u201cChanged? Well, yes, I think so,\u201d said the butler. \u201cHave I been twenty\nyears in this man\u2019s house, to be deceived about his voice? No, sir;\nmaster\u2019s made away with; he was made away with eight days ago, when we\nheard him cry out upon the name of God; and _who\u2019s_ in there instead of\nhim, and _why_ it stays there, is a thing that cries to Heaven, Mr.\nUtterson!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a very strange tale, Poole; this is rather a wild tale my\nman,\u201d said Mr. Utterson, biting his finger. \u201cSuppose it were as you\nsuppose, supposing Dr. Jekyll to have been\u2014well, murdered, what could\ninduce the murderer to stay? That won\u2019t hold water; it doesn\u2019t commend\nitself to reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Mr. Utterson, you are a hard man to satisfy, but I\u2019ll do it\nyet,\u201d said Poole. \u201cAll this last week (you must know) him, or it,\nwhatever it is that lives in that cabinet, has been crying night and\nday for some sort of medicine and cannot get it to his mind. It was\nsometimes his way\u2014the master\u2019s, that is\u2014to write his orders on a sheet\nof paper and throw it on the stair. We\u2019ve had nothing else this week\nback; nothing but papers, and a closed door, and the very meals left\nthere to be smuggled in when nobody was looking. Well, sir, every day,\nay, and twice and thrice in the same day, there have been orders and\ncomplaints, and I have been sent flying to all the wholesale chemists\nin town. Every time I brought the stuff back, there would be another\npaper telling me to return it, because it was not pure, and another\norder to a different firm. This drug is wanted bitter bad, sir,\nwhatever for.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you any of these papers?\u201d asked Mr. Utterson.\n\nPoole felt in his pocket and handed out a crumpled note, which the\nlawyer, bending nearer to the candle, carefully examined. Its contents\nran thus: \u201cDr. Jekyll presents his compliments to Messrs. Maw. He\nassures them that their last sample is impure and quite useless for his\npresent purpose. In the year 18\u2014, Dr. J. purchased a somewhat large\nquantity from Messrs. M. He now begs them to search with most sedulous\ncare, and should any of the same quality be left, forward it to him at\nonce. Expense is no consideration. The importance of this to Dr. J. can\nhardly be exaggerated.\u201d So far the letter had run composedly enough,\nbut here with a sudden splutter of the pen, the writer\u2019s emotion had\nbroken loose. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake,\u201d he added, \u201cfind me some of the old.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a strange note,\u201d said Mr. Utterson; and then sharply, \u201cHow do\nyou come to have it open?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe man at Maw\u2019s was main angry, sir, and he threw it back to me like\nso much dirt,\u201d returned Poole.\n\n\u201cThis is unquestionably the doctor\u2019s hand, do you know?\u201d resumed the\nlawyer.\n\n\u201cI thought it looked like it,\u201d said the servant rather sulkily; and\nthen, with another voice, \u201cBut what matters hand of write?\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen him!\u201d\n\n\u201cSeen him?\u201d repeated Mr. Utterson. \u201cWell?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d said Poole. \u201cIt was this way. I came suddenly into the\ntheatre from the garden. It seems he had slipped out to look for this\ndrug or whatever it is; for the cabinet door was open, and there he was\nat the far end of the room digging among the crates. He looked up when\nI came in, gave a kind of cry, and whipped upstairs into the cabinet.\nIt was but for one minute that I saw him, but the hair stood upon my\nhead like quills. Sir, if that was my master, why had he a mask upon\nhis face? If it was my master, why did he cry out like a rat, and run\nfrom me? I have served him long enough. And then...\u201d The man paused and\npassed his hand over his face.\n\n\u201cThese are all very strange circumstances,\u201d said Mr. Utterson, \u201cbut I\nthink I begin to see daylight. Your master, Poole, is plainly seized\nwith one of those maladies that both torture and deform the sufferer;\nhence, for aught I know, the alteration of his voice; hence the mask\nand the avoidance of his friends; hence his eagerness to find this\ndrug, by means of which the poor soul retains some hope of ultimate\nrecovery\u2014God grant that he be not deceived! There is my explanation; it\nis sad enough, Poole, ay, and appalling to consider; but it is plain\nand natural, hangs well together, and delivers us from all exorbitant\nalarms.\u201d\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d said the butler, turning to a sort of mottled pallor, \u201cthat\nthing was not my master, and there\u2019s the truth. My master\u201d\u2014here he\nlooked round him and began to whisper\u2014\u201cis a tall, fine build of a man,\nand this was more of a dwarf.\u201d Utterson attempted to protest. \u201cO, sir,\u201d\ncried Poole, \u201cdo you think I do not know my master after twenty years?\nDo you think I do not know where his head comes to in the cabinet door,\nwhere I saw him every morning of my life? No, sir, that thing in the\nmask was never Dr. Jekyll\u2014God knows what it was, but it was never Dr.\nJekyll; and it is the belief of my heart that there was murder done.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoole,\u201d replied the lawyer, \u201cif you say that, it will become my duty\nto make certain. Much as I desire to spare your master\u2019s feelings, much\nas I am puzzled by this note which seems to prove him to be still\nalive, I shall consider it my duty to break in that door.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, Mr. Utterson, that\u2019s talking!\u201d cried the butler.\n\n\u201cAnd now comes the second question,\u201d resumed Utterson: \u201cWho is going to\ndo it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, you and me, sir,\u201d was the undaunted reply.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very well said,\u201d returned the lawyer; \u201cand whatever comes of\nit, I shall make it my business to see you are no loser.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is an axe in the theatre,\u201d continued Poole; \u201cand you might take\nthe kitchen poker for yourself.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer took that rude but weighty instrument into his hand, and\nbalanced it. \u201cDo you know, Poole,\u201d he said, looking up, \u201cthat you and I\nare about to place ourselves in a position of some peril?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may say so, sir, indeed,\u201d returned the butler.\n\n\u201cIt is well, then that we should be frank,\u201d said the other. \u201cWe both\nthink more than we have said; let us make a clean breast. This masked\nfigure that you saw, did you recognise it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, sir, it went so quick, and the creature was so doubled up, that\nI could hardly swear to that,\u201d was the answer. \u201cBut if you mean, was it\nMr. Hyde?\u2014why, yes, I think it was! You see, it was much of the same\nbigness; and it had the same quick, light way with it; and then who\nelse could have got in by the laboratory door? You have not forgot,\nsir, that at the time of the murder he had still the key with him? But\nthat\u2019s not all. I don\u2019t know, Mr. Utterson, if you ever met this Mr.\nHyde?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the lawyer, \u201cI once spoke with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you must know as well as the rest of us that there was something\nqueer about that gentleman\u2014something that gave a man a turn\u2014I don\u2019t\nknow rightly how to say it, sir, beyond this: that you felt in your\nmarrow kind of cold and thin.\u201d\n\n\u201cI own I felt something of what you describe,\u201d said Mr. Utterson.\n\n\u201cQuite so, sir,\u201d returned Poole. \u201cWell, when that masked thing like a\nmonkey jumped from among the chemicals and whipped into the cabinet, it\nwent down my spine like ice. O, I know it\u2019s not evidence, Mr. Utterson;\nI\u2019m book-learned enough for that; but a man has his feelings, and I\ngive you my bible-word it was Mr. Hyde!\u201d\n\n\u201cAy, ay,\u201d said the lawyer. \u201cMy fears incline to the same point. Evil, I\nfear, founded\u2014evil was sure to come\u2014of that connection. Ay truly, I\nbelieve you; I believe poor Harry is killed; and I believe his murderer\n(for what purpose, God alone can tell) is still lurking in his victim\u2019s\nroom. Well, let our name be vengeance. Call Bradshaw.\u201d\n\nThe footman came at the summons, very white and nervous.\n\n\u201cPull yourself together, Bradshaw,\u201d said the lawyer. \u201cThis suspense, I\nknow, is telling upon all of you; but it is now our intention to make\nan end of it. Poole, here, and I are going to force our way into the\ncabinet. If all is well, my shoulders are broad enough to bear the\nblame. Meanwhile, lest anything should really be amiss, or any\nmalefactor seek to escape by the back, you and the boy must go round\nthe corner with a pair of good sticks and take your post at the\nlaboratory door. We give you ten minutes to get to your stations.\u201d\n\nAs Bradshaw left, the lawyer looked at his watch. \u201cAnd now, Poole, let\nus get to ours,\u201d he said; and taking the poker under his arm, led the\nway into the yard. The scud had banked over the moon, and it was now\nquite dark. The wind, which only broke in puffs and draughts into that\ndeep well of building, tossed the light of the candle to and fro about\ntheir steps, until they came into the shelter of the theatre, where\nthey sat down silently to wait. London hummed solemnly all around; but\nnearer at hand, the stillness was only broken by the sounds of a\nfootfall moving to and fro along the cabinet floor.\n\n\u201cSo it will walk all day, sir,\u201d whispered Poole; \u201cay, and the better\npart of the night. Only when a new sample comes from the chemist,\nthere\u2019s a bit of a break. Ah, it\u2019s an ill conscience that\u2019s such an\nenemy to rest! Ah, sir, there\u2019s blood foully shed in every step of it!\nBut hark again, a little closer\u2014put your heart in your ears, Mr.\nUtterson, and tell me, is that the doctor\u2019s foot?\u201d\n\nThe steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all they\nwent so slowly; it was different indeed from the heavy creaking tread\nof Henry Jekyll. Utterson sighed. \u201cIs there never anything else?\u201d he\nasked.\n\nPoole nodded. \u201cOnce,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce I heard it weeping!\u201d\n\n\u201cWeeping? how that?\u201d said the lawyer, conscious of a sudden chill of\nhorror.\n\n\u201cWeeping like a woman or a lost soul,\u201d said the butler. \u201cI came away\nwith that upon my heart, that I could have wept too.\u201d\n\nBut now the ten minutes drew to an end. Poole disinterred the axe from\nunder a stack of packing straw; the candle was set upon the nearest\ntable to light them to the attack; and they drew near with bated breath\nto where that patient foot was still going up and down, up and down, in\nthe quiet of the night.\n\n\u201cJekyll,\u201d cried Utterson, with a loud voice, \u201cI demand to see you.\u201d He\npaused a moment, but there came no reply. \u201cI give you fair warning, our\nsuspicions are aroused, and I must and shall see you,\u201d he resumed; \u201cif\nnot by fair means, then by foul\u2014if not of your consent, then by brute\nforce!\u201d\n\n\u201cUtterson,\u201d said the voice, \u201cfor God\u2019s sake, have mercy!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s not Jekyll\u2019s voice\u2014it\u2019s Hyde\u2019s!\u201d cried Utterson. \u201cDown with\nthe door, Poole!\u201d\n\nPoole swung the axe over his shoulder; the blow shook the building, and\nthe red baize door leaped against the lock and hinges. A dismal\nscreech, as of mere animal terror, rang from the cabinet. Up went the\naxe again, and again the panels crashed and the frame bounded; four\ntimes the blow fell; but the wood was tough and the fittings were of\nexcellent workmanship; and it was not until the fifth, that the lock\nburst and the wreck of the door fell inwards on the carpet.\n\nThe besiegers, appalled by their own riot and the stillness that had\nsucceeded, stood back a little and peered in. There lay the cabinet\nbefore their eyes in the quiet lamplight, a good fire glowing and\nchattering on the hearth, the kettle singing its thin strain, a drawer\nor two open, papers neatly set forth on the business table, and nearer\nthe fire, the things laid out for tea; the quietest room, you would\nhave said, and, but for the glazed presses full of chemicals, the most\ncommonplace that night in London.\n\nRight in the middle there lay the body of a man sorely contorted and\nstill twitching. They drew near on tiptoe, turned it on its back and\nbeheld the face of Edward Hyde. He was dressed in clothes far too large\nfor him, clothes of the doctor\u2019s bigness; the cords of his face still\nmoved with a semblance of life, but life was quite gone; and by the\ncrushed phial in the hand and the strong smell of kernels that hung\nupon the air, Utterson knew that he was looking on the body of a\nself-destroyer.\n\n\u201cWe have come too late,\u201d he said sternly, \u201cwhether to save or punish.\nHyde is gone to his account; and it only remains for us to find the\nbody of your master.\u201d\n\nThe far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the theatre,\nwhich filled almost the whole ground storey and was lighted from above,\nand by the cabinet, which formed an upper storey at one end and looked\nupon the court. A corridor joined the theatre to the door on the\nby-street; and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a\nsecond flight of stairs. There were besides a few dark closets and a\nspacious cellar. All these they now thoroughly examined. Each closet\nneeded but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fell\nfrom their doors, had stood long unopened. The cellar, indeed, was\nfilled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeon\nwho was Jekyll\u2019s predecessor; but even as they opened the door they\nwere advertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of a\nperfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance.\nNowhere was there any trace of Henry Jekyll, dead or alive.\n\nPoole stamped on the flags of the corridor. \u201cHe must be buried here,\u201d\nhe said, hearkening to the sound.\n\n\u201cOr he may have fled,\u201d said Utterson, and he turned to examine the door\nin the by-street. It was locked; and lying near by on the flags, they\nfound the key, already stained with rust.\n\n\u201cThis does not look like use,\u201d observed the lawyer.\n\n\u201cUse!\u201d echoed Poole. \u201cDo you not see, sir, it is broken? much as if a\nman had stamped on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAy,\u201d continued Utterson, \u201cand the fractures, too, are rusty.\u201d The two\nmen looked at each other with a scare. \u201cThis is beyond me, Poole,\u201d said\nthe lawyer. \u201cLet us go back to the cabinet.\u201d\n\nThey mounted the stair in silence, and still with an occasional\nawestruck glance at the dead body, proceeded more thoroughly to examine\nthe contents of the cabinet. At one table, there were traces of\nchemical work, various measured heaps of some white salt being laid on\nglass saucers, as though for an experiment in which the unhappy man had\nbeen prevented.\n\n\u201cThat is the same drug that I was always bringing him,\u201d said Poole; and\neven as he spoke, the kettle with a startling noise boiled over.\n\nThis brought them to the fireside, where the easy-chair was drawn\ncosily up, and the tea things stood ready to the sitter\u2019s elbow, the\nvery sugar in the cup. There were several books on a shelf; one lay\nbeside the tea things open, and Utterson was amazed to find it a copy\nof a pious work, for which Jekyll had several times expressed a great\nesteem, annotated, in his own hand with startling blasphemies.\n\nNext, in the course of their review of the chamber, the searchers came\nto the cheval-glass, into whose depths they looked with an involuntary\nhorror. But it was so turned as to show them nothing but the rosy glow\nplaying on the roof, the fire sparkling in a hundred repetitions along\nthe glazed front of the presses, and their own pale and fearful\ncountenances stooping to look in.\n\n\u201cThis glass has seen some strange things, sir,\u201d whispered Poole.\n\n\u201cAnd surely none stranger than itself,\u201d echoed the lawyer in the same\ntones. \u201cFor what did Jekyll\u201d\u2014he caught himself up at the word with a\nstart, and then conquering the weakness\u2014\u201cwhat could Jekyll want with\nit?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou may say that!\u201d said Poole.\n\nNext they turned to the business table. On the desk, among the neat\narray of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the\ndoctor\u2019s hand, the name of Mr. Utterson. The lawyer unsealed it, and\nseveral enclosures fell to the floor. The first was a will, drawn in\nthe same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months\nbefore, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift\nin case of disappearance; but in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the\nlawyer, with indescribable amazement read the name of Gabriel John\nUtterson. He looked at Poole, and then back at the paper, and last of\nall at the dead malefactor stretched upon the carpet.\n\n\u201cMy head goes round,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has been all these days in\npossession; he had no cause to like me; he must have raged to see\nhimself displaced; and he has not destroyed this document.\u201d\n\nHe caught up the next paper; it was a brief note in the doctor\u2019s hand\nand dated at the top. \u201cO Poole!\u201d the lawyer cried, \u201che was alive and\nhere this day. He cannot have been disposed of in so short a space; he\nmust be still alive, he must have fled! And then, why fled? and how?\nand in that case, can we venture to declare this suicide? O, we must be\ncareful. I foresee that we may yet involve your master in some dire\ncatastrophe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you read it, sir?\u201d asked Poole.\n\n\u201cBecause I fear,\u201d replied the lawyer solemnly. \u201cGod grant I have no\ncause for it!\u201d And with that he brought the paper to his eyes and read\nas follows:\n\n\n\u201cMy dear Utterson,\u2014When this shall fall into your hands, I shall have\ndisappeared, under what circumstances I have not the penetration to\nforesee, but my instinct and all the circumstances of my nameless\nsituation tell me that the end is sure and must be early. Go then, and\nfirst read the narrative which Lanyon warned me he was to place in your\nhands; and if you care to hear more, turn to the confession of\n\n\u201cYour unworthy and unhappy friend,\n\n\u201cHENRY JEKYLL.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere was a third enclosure?\u201d asked Utterson.\n\n\u201cHere, sir,\u201d said Poole, and gave into his hands a considerable packet\nsealed in several places.\n\nThe lawyer put it in his pocket. \u201cI would say nothing of this paper. If\nyour master has fled or is dead, we may at least save his credit. It is\nnow ten; I must go home and read these documents in quiet; but I shall\nbe back before midnight, when we shall send for the police.\u201d\n\nThey went out, locking the door of the theatre behind them; and\nUtterson, once more leaving the servants gathered about the fire in the\nhall, trudged back to his office to read the two narratives in which\nthis mystery was now to be explained.\n\n\n\nDR. LANYON\u2019S NARRATIVE\n\nOn the ninth of January, now four days ago, I received by the evening\ndelivery a registered envelope, addressed in the hand of my colleague\nand old school companion, Henry Jekyll. I was a good deal surprised by\nthis; for we were by no means in the habit of correspondence; I had\nseen the man, dined with him, indeed, the night before; and I could\nimagine nothing in our intercourse that should justify formality of\nregistration. The contents increased my wonder; for this is how the\nletter ran:\n\n\u201c10_th December_, 18\u2014.\n\n\n\u201cDear Lanyon,\u2014You are one of my oldest friends; and although we may\nhave differed at times on scientific questions, I cannot remember, at\nleast on my side, any break in our affection. There was never a day\nwhen, if you had said to me, \u2018Jekyll, my life, my honour, my reason,\ndepend upon you,\u2019 I would not have sacrificed my left hand to help you.\nLanyon, my life, my honour, my reason, are all at your mercy; if you\nfail me to-night, I am lost. You might suppose, after this preface,\nthat I am going to ask you for something dishonourable to grant. Judge\nfor yourself.\n\n\u201cI want you to postpone all other engagements for to-night\u2014ay, even if\nyou were summoned to the bedside of an emperor; to take a cab, unless\nyour carriage should be actually at the door; and with this letter in\nyour hand for consultation, to drive straight to my house. Poole, my\nbutler, has his orders; you will find him waiting your arrival with a\nlocksmith. The door of my cabinet is then to be forced; and you are to\ngo in alone; to open the glazed press (letter E) on the left hand,\nbreaking the lock if it be shut; and to draw out, _with all its\ncontents as they stand_, the fourth drawer from the top or (which is\nthe same thing) the third from the bottom. In my extreme distress of\nmind, I have a morbid fear of misdirecting you; but even if I am in\nerror, you may know the right drawer by its contents: some powders, a\nphial and a paper book. This drawer I beg of you to carry back with you\nto Cavendish Square exactly as it stands.\n\n\u201cThat is the first part of the service: now for the second. You should\nbe back, if you set out at once on the receipt of this, long before\nmidnight; but I will leave you that amount of margin, not only in the\nfear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented nor\nforeseen, but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to be\npreferred for what will then remain to do. At midnight, then, I have to\nask you to be alone in your consulting room, to admit with your own\nhand into the house a man who will present himself in my name, and to\nplace in his hands the drawer that you will have brought with you from\nmy cabinet. Then you will have played your part and earned my gratitude\ncompletely. Five minutes afterwards, if you insist upon an explanation,\nyou will have understood that these arrangements are of capital\nimportance; and that by the neglect of one of them, fantastic as they\nmust appear, you might have charged your conscience with my death or\nthe shipwreck of my reason.\n\n\u201cConfident as I am that you will not trifle with this appeal, my heart\nsinks and my hand trembles at the bare thought of such a possibility.\nThink of me at this hour, in a strange place, labouring under a\nblackness of distress that no fancy can exaggerate, and yet well aware\nthat, if you will but punctually serve me, my troubles will roll away\nlike a story that is told. Serve me, my dear Lanyon and save\n\n\u201cYour friend,\n\n\n\u201cH.J.\n\n\n\u201cP.S.\u2014I had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struck upon my\nsoul. It is possible that the post-office may fail me, and this letter\nnot come into your hands until to-morrow morning. In that case, dear\nLanyon, do my errand when it shall be most convenient for you in the\ncourse of the day; and once more expect my messenger at midnight. It\nmay then already be too late; and if that night passes without event,\nyou will know that you have seen the last of Henry Jekyll.\u201d\n\n\nUpon the reading of this letter, I made sure my colleague was insane;\nbut till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt, I felt bound\nto do as he requested. The less I understood of this farrago, the less\nI was in a position to judge of its importance; and an appeal so worded\ncould not be set aside without a grave responsibility. I rose\naccordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight to\nJekyll\u2019s house. The butler was awaiting my arrival; he had received by\nthe same post as mine a registered letter of instruction, and had sent\nat once for a locksmith and a carpenter. The tradesmen came while we\nwere yet speaking; and we moved in a body to old Dr. Denman\u2019s surgical\ntheatre, from which (as you are doubtless aware) Jekyll\u2019s private\ncabinet is most conveniently entered. The door was very strong, the\nlock excellent; the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble and\nhave to do much damage, if force were to be used; and the locksmith was\nnear despair. But this last was a handy fellow, and after two hour\u2019s\nwork, the door stood open. The press marked E was unlocked; and I took\nout the drawer, had it filled up with straw and tied in a sheet, and\nreturned with it to Cavendish Square.\n\nHere I proceeded to examine its contents. The powders were neatly\nenough made up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist; so\nthat it was plain they were of Jekyll\u2019s private manufacture; and when I\nopened one of the wrappers I found what seemed to me a simple\ncrystalline salt of a white colour. The phial, to which I next turned\nmy attention, might have been about half full of a blood-red liquor,\nwhich was highly pungent to the sense of smell and seemed to me to\ncontain phosphorus and some volatile ether. At the other ingredients I\ncould make no guess. The book was an ordinary version book and\ncontained little but a series of dates. These covered a period of many\nyears, but I observed that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and\nquite abruptly. Here and there a brief remark was appended to a date,\nusually no more than a single word: \u201cdouble\u201d occurring perhaps six\ntimes in a total of several hundred entries; and once very early in the\nlist and followed by several marks of exclamation, \u201ctotal failure!!!\u201d\nAll this, though it whetted my curiosity, told me little that was\ndefinite. Here were a phial of some salt, and the record of a series of\nexperiments that had led (like too many of Jekyll\u2019s investigations) to\nno end of practical usefulness. How could the presence of these\narticles in my house affect either the honour, the sanity, or the life\nof my flighty colleague? If his messenger could go to one place, why\ncould he not go to another? And even granting some impediment, why was\nthis gentleman to be received by me in secret? The more I reflected the\nmore convinced I grew that I was dealing with a case of cerebral\ndisease; and though I dismissed my servants to bed, I loaded an old\nrevolver, that I might be found in some posture of self-defence.\n\nTwelve o\u2019clock had scarce rung out over London, ere the knocker sounded\nvery gently on the door. I went myself at the summons, and found a\nsmall man crouching against the pillars of the portico.\n\n\u201cAre you come from Dr. Jekyll?\u201d I asked.\n\nHe told me \u201cyes\u201d by a constrained gesture; and when I had bidden him\nenter, he did not obey me without a searching backward glance into the\ndarkness of the square. There was a policeman not far off, advancing\nwith his bull\u2019s eye open; and at the sight, I thought my visitor\nstarted and made greater haste.\n\nThese particulars struck me, I confess, disagreeably; and as I followed\nhim into the bright light of the consulting room, I kept my hand ready\non my weapon. Here, at last, I had a chance of clearly seeing him. I\nhad never set eyes on him before, so much was certain. He was small, as\nI have said; I was struck besides with the shocking expression of his\nface, with his remarkable combination of great muscular activity and\ngreat apparent debility of constitution, and\u2014last but not least\u2014with\nthe odd, subjective disturbance caused by his neighbourhood. This bore\nsome resemblance to incipient rigour, and was accompanied by a marked\nsinking of the pulse. At the time, I set it down to some idiosyncratic,\npersonal distaste, and merely wondered at the acuteness of the\nsymptoms; but I have since had reason to believe the cause to lie much\ndeeper in the nature of man, and to turn on some nobler hinge than the\nprinciple of hatred.\n\nThis person (who had thus, from the first moment of his entrance,\nstruck in me what I can only describe as a disgustful curiosity) was\ndressed in a fashion that would have made an ordinary person laughable;\nhis clothes, that is to say, although they were of rich and sober\nfabric, were enormously too large for him in every measurement\u2014the\ntrousers hanging on his legs and rolled up to keep them from the\nground, the waist of the coat below his haunches, and the collar\nsprawling wide upon his shoulders. Strange to relate, this ludicrous\naccoutrement was far from moving me to laughter. Rather, as there was\nsomething abnormal and misbegotten in the very essence of the creature\nthat now faced me\u2014something seizing, surprising and revolting\u2014this\nfresh disparity seemed but to fit in with and to reinforce it; so that\nto my interest in the man\u2019s nature and character, there was added a\ncuriosity as to his origin, his life, his fortune and status in the\nworld.\n\nThese observations, though they have taken so great a space to be set\ndown in, were yet the work of a few seconds. My visitor was, indeed, on\nfire with sombre excitement.\n\n\u201cHave you got it?\u201d he cried. \u201cHave you got it?\u201d And so lively was his\nimpatience that he even laid his hand upon my arm and sought to shake\nme.\n\nI put him back, conscious at his touch of a certain icy pang along my\nblood. \u201cCome, sir,\u201d said I. \u201cYou forget that I have not yet the\npleasure of your acquaintance. Be seated, if you please.\u201d And I showed\nhim an example, and sat down myself in my customary seat and with as\nfair an imitation of my ordinary manner to a patient, as the lateness\nof the hour, the nature of my preoccupations, and the horror I had of\nmy visitor, would suffer me to muster.\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon, Dr. Lanyon,\u201d he replied civilly enough. \u201cWhat you\nsay is very well founded; and my impatience has shown its heels to my\npoliteness. I come here at the instance of your colleague, Dr. Henry\nJekyll, on a piece of business of some moment; and I understood...\u201d He\npaused and put his hand to his throat, and I could see, in spite of his\ncollected manner, that he was wrestling against the approaches of the\nhysteria\u2014\u201cI understood, a drawer...\u201d\n\nBut here I took pity on my visitor\u2019s suspense, and some perhaps on my\nown growing curiosity.\n\n\u201cThere it is, sir,\u201d said I, pointing to the drawer, where it lay on the\nfloor behind a table and still covered with the sheet.\n\nHe sprang to it, and then paused, and laid his hand upon his heart; I\ncould hear his teeth grate with the convulsive action of his jaws; and\nhis face was so ghastly to see that I grew alarmed both for his life\nand reason.\n\n\u201cCompose yourself,\u201d said I.\n\nHe turned a dreadful smile to me, and as if with the decision of\ndespair, plucked away the sheet. At sight of the contents, he uttered\none loud sob of such immense relief that I sat petrified. And the next\nmoment, in a voice that was already fairly well under control, \u201cHave\nyou a graduated glass?\u201d he asked.\n\nI rose from my place with something of an effort and gave him what he\nasked.\n\nHe thanked me with a smiling nod, measured out a few minims of the red\ntincture and added one of the powders. The mixture, which was at first\nof a reddish hue, began, in proportion as the crystals melted, to\nbrighten in colour, to effervesce audibly, and to throw off small fumes\nof vapour. Suddenly and at the same moment, the ebullition ceased and\nthe compound changed to a dark purple, which faded again more slowly to\na watery green. My visitor, who had watched these metamorphoses with a\nkeen eye, smiled, set down the glass upon the table, and then turned\nand looked upon me with an air of scrutiny.\n\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d said he, \u201cto settle what remains. Will you be wise? will you\nbe guided? will you suffer me to take this glass in my hand and to go\nforth from your house without further parley? or has the greed of\ncuriosity too much command of you? Think before you answer, for it\nshall be done as you decide. As you decide, you shall be left as you\nwere before, and neither richer nor wiser, unless the sense of service\nrendered to a man in mortal distress may be counted as a kind of riches\nof the soul. Or, if you shall so prefer to choose, a new province of\nknowledge and new avenues to fame and power shall be laid open to you,\nhere, in this room, upon the instant; and your sight shall be blasted\nby a prodigy to stagger the unbelief of Satan.\u201d\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d said I, affecting a coolness that I was far from truly\npossessing, \u201cyou speak enigmas, and you will perhaps not wonder that I\nhear you with no very strong impression of belief. But I have gone too\nfar in the way of inexplicable services to pause before I see the end.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is well,\u201d replied my visitor. \u201cLanyon, you remember your vows: what\nfollows is under the seal of our profession. And now, you who have so\nlong been bound to the most narrow and material views, you who have\ndenied the virtue of transcendental medicine, you who have derided your\nsuperiors\u2014behold!\u201d\n\nHe put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp. A cry followed; he\nreeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held on, staring with\ninjected eyes, gasping with open mouth; and as I looked there came, I\nthought, a change\u2014he seemed to swell\u2014his face became suddenly black and\nthe features seemed to melt and alter\u2014and the next moment, I had sprung\nto my feet and leaped back against the wall, my arms raised to shield\nme from that prodigy, my mind submerged in terror.\n\n\u201cO God!\u201d I screamed, and \u201cO God!\u201d again and again; for there before my\neyes\u2014pale and shaken, and half fainting, and groping before him with\nhis hands, like a man restored from death\u2014there stood Henry Jekyll!\n\nWhat he told me in the next hour, I cannot bring my mind to set on\npaper. I saw what I saw, I heard what I heard, and my soul sickened at\nit; and yet now when that sight has faded from my eyes, I ask myself if\nI believe it, and I cannot answer. My life is shaken to its roots;\nsleep has left me; the deadliest terror sits by me at all hours of the\nday and night; and I feel that my days are numbered, and that I must\ndie; and yet I shall die incredulous. As for the moral turpitude that\nman unveiled to me, even with tears of penitence, I cannot, even in\nmemory, dwell on it without a start of horror. I will say but one\nthing, Utterson, and that (if you can bring your mind to credit it)\nwill be more than enough. The creature who crept into my house that\nnight was, on Jekyll\u2019s own confession, known by the name of Hyde and\nhunted for in every corner of the land as the murderer of Carew.\n\nHASTIE LANYON.\n\n\n\n\nHENRY JEKYLL\u2019S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nI was born in the year 18\u2014 to a large fortune, endowed besides with\nexcellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect of\nthe wise and good among my fellowmen, and thus, as might have been\nsupposed, with every guarantee of an honourable and distinguished\nfuture. And indeed the worst of my faults was a certain impatient\ngaiety of disposition, such as has made the happiness of many, but such\nas I found it hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry my\nhead high, and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the\npublic. Hence it came about that I concealed my pleasures; and that\nwhen I reached years of reflection, and began to look round me and take\nstock of my progress and position in the world, I stood already\ncommitted to a profound duplicity of life. Many a man would have even\nblazoned such irregularities as I was guilty of; but from the high\nviews that I had set before me, I regarded and hid them with an almost\nmorbid sense of shame. It was thus rather the exacting nature of my\naspirations than any particular degradation in my faults, that made me\nwhat I was, and, with even a deeper trench than in the majority of men,\nsevered in me those provinces of good and ill which divide and compound\nman\u2019s dual nature. In this case, I was driven to reflect deeply and\ninveterately on that hard law of life, which lies at the root of\nreligion and is one of the most plentiful springs of distress. Though\nso profound a double-dealer, I was in no sense a hypocrite; both sides\nof me were in dead earnest; I was no more myself when I laid aside\nrestraint and plunged in shame, than when I laboured, in the eye of\nday, at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and\nsuffering. And it chanced that the direction of my scientific studies,\nwhich led wholly towards the mystic and the transcendental, reacted and\nshed a strong light on this consciousness of the perennial war among my\nmembers. With every day, and from both sides of my intelligence, the\nmoral and the intellectual, I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth,\nby whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful\nshipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two. I say two, because\nthe state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that point. Others\nwill follow, others will outstrip me on the same lines; and I hazard\nthe guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of\nmultifarious, incongruous and independent denizens. I, for my part,\nfrom the nature of my life, advanced infallibly in one direction and in\none direction only. It was on the moral side, and in my own person,\nthat I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man;\nI saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of my\nconsciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it was\nonly because I was radically both; and from an early date, even before\nthe course of my scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the most\nnaked possibility of such a miracle, I had learned to dwell with\npleasure, as a beloved daydream, on the thought of the separation of\nthese elements. If each, I told myself, could be housed in separate\nidentities, life would be relieved of all that was unbearable; the\nunjust might go his way, delivered from the aspirations and remorse of\nhis more upright twin; and the just could walk steadfastly and securely\non his upward path, doing the good things in which he found his\npleasure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands\nof this extraneous evil. It was the curse of mankind that these\nincongruous faggots were thus bound together\u2014that in the agonised womb\nof consciousness, these polar twins should be continuously struggling.\nHow, then were they dissociated?\n\nI was so far in my reflections when, as I have said, a side light began\nto shine upon the subject from the laboratory table. I began to\nperceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated, the trembling\nimmateriality, the mistlike transience, of this seemingly so solid body\nin which we walk attired. Certain agents I found to have the power to\nshake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss\nthe curtains of a pavilion. For two good reasons, I will not enter\ndeeply into this scientific branch of my confession. First, because I\nhave been made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound\nfor ever on man\u2019s shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast it\noff, it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful\npressure. Second, because, as my narrative will make, alas! too\nevident, my discoveries were incomplete. Enough then, that I not only\nrecognised my natural body from the mere aura and effulgence of certain\nof the powers that made up my spirit, but managed to compound a drug by\nwhich these powers should be dethroned from their supremacy, and a\nsecond form and countenance substituted, none the less natural to me\nbecause they were the expression, and bore the stamp, of lower elements\nin my soul.\n\nI hesitated long before I put this theory to the test of practice. I\nknew well that I risked death; for any drug that so potently controlled\nand shook the very fortress of identity, might, by the least scruple of\nan overdose or at the least inopportunity in the moment of exhibition,\nutterly blot out that immaterial tabernacle which I looked to it to\nchange. But the temptation of a discovery so singular and profound at\nlast overcame the suggestions of alarm. I had long since prepared my\ntincture; I purchased at once, from a firm of wholesale chemists, a\nlarge quantity of a particular salt which I knew, from my experiments,\nto be the last ingredient required; and late one accursed night, I\ncompounded the elements, watched them boil and smoke together in the\nglass, and when the ebullition had subsided, with a strong glow of\ncourage, drank off the potion.\n\nThe most racking pangs succeeded: a grinding in the bones, deadly\nnausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour\nof birth or death. Then these agonies began swiftly to subside, and I\ncame to myself as if out of a great sickness. There was something\nstrange in my sensations, something indescribably new and, from its\nvery novelty, incredibly sweet. I felt younger, lighter, happier in\nbody; within I was conscious of a heady recklessness, a current of\ndisordered sensual images running like a millrace in my fancy, a\nsolution of the bonds of obligation, an unknown but not an innocent\nfreedom of the soul. I knew myself, at the first breath of this new\nlife, to be more wicked, tenfold more wicked, sold a slave to my\noriginal evil; and the thought, in that moment, braced and delighted me\nlike wine. I stretched out my hands, exulting in the freshness of these\nsensations; and in the act, I was suddenly aware that I had lost in\nstature.\n\nThere was no mirror, at that date, in my room; that which stands beside\nme as I write, was brought there later on and for the very purpose of\nthese transformations. The night however, was far gone into the\nmorning\u2014the morning, black as it was, was nearly ripe for the\nconception of the day\u2014the inmates of my house were locked in the most\nrigorous hours of slumber; and I determined, flushed as I was with hope\nand triumph, to venture in my new shape as far as to my bedroom. I\ncrossed the yard, wherein the constellations looked down upon me, I\ncould have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that sort that\ntheir unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to them; I stole through\nthe corridors, a stranger in my own house; and coming to my room, I saw\nfor the first time the appearance of Edward Hyde.\n\nI must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which I know, but\nthat which I suppose to be most probable. The evil side of my nature,\nto which I had now transferred the stamping efficacy, was less robust\nand less developed than the good which I had just deposed. Again, in\nthe course of my life, which had been, after all, nine tenths a life of\neffort, virtue and control, it had been much less exercised and much\nless exhausted. And hence, as I think, it came about that Edward Hyde\nwas so much smaller, slighter and younger than Henry Jekyll. Even as\ngood shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly\nand plainly on the face of the other. Evil besides (which I must still\nbelieve to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an imprint\nof deformity and decay. And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol in\nthe glass, I was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of\nwelcome. This, too, was myself. It seemed natural and human. In my eyes\nit bore a livelier image of the spirit, it seemed more express and\nsingle, than the imperfect and divided countenance I had been hitherto\naccustomed to call mine. And in so far I was doubtless right. I have\nobserved that when I wore the semblance of Edward Hyde, none could come\nnear to me at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh. This, as\nI take it, was because all human beings, as we meet them, are\ncommingled out of good and evil: and Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of\nmankind, was pure evil.\n\nI lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive\nexperiment had yet to be attempted; it yet remained to be seen if I had\nlost my identity beyond redemption and must flee before daylight from a\nhouse that was no longer mine; and hurrying back to my cabinet, I once\nmore prepared and drank the cup, once more suffered the pangs of\ndissolution, and came to myself once more with the character, the\nstature and the face of Henry Jekyll.\n\nThat night I had come to the fatal cross-roads. Had I approached my\ndiscovery in a more noble spirit, had I risked the experiment while\nunder the empire of generous or pious aspirations, all must have been\notherwise, and from these agonies of death and birth, I had come forth\nan angel instead of a fiend. The drug had no discriminating action; it\nwas neither diabolical nor divine; it but shook the doors of the\nprisonhouse of my disposition; and like the captives of Philippi, that\nwhich stood within ran forth. At that time my virtue slumbered; my\nevil, kept awake by ambition, was alert and swift to seize the\noccasion; and the thing that was projected was Edward Hyde. Hence,\nalthough I had now two characters as well as two appearances, one was\nwholly evil, and the other was still the old Henry Jekyll, that\nincongruous compound of whose reformation and improvement I had already\nlearned to despair. The movement was thus wholly toward the worse.\n\nEven at that time, I had not conquered my aversions to the dryness of a\nlife of study. I would still be merrily disposed at times; and as my\npleasures were (to say the least) undignified, and I was not only well\nknown and highly considered, but growing towards the elderly man, this\nincoherency of my life was daily growing more unwelcome. It was on this\nside that my new power tempted me until I fell in slavery. I had but to\ndrink the cup, to doff at once the body of the noted professor, and to\nassume, like a thick cloak, that of Edward Hyde. I smiled at the\nnotion; it seemed to me at the time to be humourous; and I made my\npreparations with the most studious care. I took and furnished that\nhouse in Soho, to which Hyde was tracked by the police; and engaged as\na housekeeper a creature whom I knew well to be silent and\nunscrupulous. On the other side, I announced to my servants that a Mr.\nHyde (whom I described) was to have full liberty and power about my\nhouse in the square; and to parry mishaps, I even called and made\nmyself a familiar object, in my second character. I next drew up that\nwill to which you so much objected; so that if anything befell me in\nthe person of Dr. Jekyll, I could enter on that of Edward Hyde without\npecuniary loss. And thus fortified, as I supposed, on every side, I\nbegan to profit by the strange immunities of my position.\n\nMen have before hired bravos to transact their crimes, while their own\nperson and reputation sat under shelter. I was the first that ever did\nso for his pleasures. I was the first that could plod in the public eye\nwith a load of genial respectability, and in a moment, like a\nschoolboy, strip off these lendings and spring headlong into the sea of\nliberty. But for me, in my impenetrable mantle, the safety was\ncomplete. Think of it\u2014I did not even exist! Let me but escape into my\nlaboratory door, give me but a second or two to mix and swallow the\ndraught that I had always standing ready; and whatever he had done,\nEdward Hyde would pass away like the stain of breath upon a mirror; and\nthere in his stead, quietly at home, trimming the midnight lamp in his\nstudy, a man who could afford to laugh at suspicion, would be Henry\nJekyll.\n\nThe pleasures which I made haste to seek in my disguise were, as I have\nsaid, undignified; I would scarce use a harder term. But in the hands\nof Edward Hyde, they soon began to turn toward the monstrous. When I\nwould come back from these excursions, I was often plunged into a kind\nof wonder at my vicarious depravity. This familiar that I called out of\nmy own soul, and sent forth alone to do his good pleasure, was a being\ninherently malign and villainous; his every act and thought centered on\nself; drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of torture\nto another; relentless like a man of stone. Henry Jekyll stood at times\naghast before the acts of Edward Hyde; but the situation was apart from\nordinary laws, and insidiously relaxed the grasp of conscience. It was\nHyde, after all, and Hyde alone, that was guilty. Jekyll was no worse;\nhe woke again to his good qualities seemingly unimpaired; he would even\nmake haste, where it was possible, to undo the evil done by Hyde. And\nthus his conscience slumbered.\n\nInto the details of the infamy at which I thus connived (for even now I\ncan scarce grant that I committed it) I have no design of entering; I\nmean but to point out the warnings and the successive steps with which\nmy chastisement approached. I met with one accident which, as it\nbrought on no consequence, I shall no more than mention. An act of\ncruelty to a child aroused against me the anger of a passer-by, whom I\nrecognised the other day in the person of your kinsman; the doctor and\nthe child\u2019s family joined him; there were moments when I feared for my\nlife; and at last, in order to pacify their too just resentment, Edward\nHyde had to bring them to the door, and pay them in a cheque drawn in\nthe name of Henry Jekyll. But this danger was easily eliminated from\nthe future, by opening an account at another bank in the name of Edward\nHyde himself; and when, by sloping my own hand backward, I had supplied\nmy double with a signature, I thought I sat beyond the reach of fate.\n\nSome two months before the murder of Sir Danvers, I had been out for\none of my adventures, had returned at a late hour, and woke the next\nday in bed with somewhat odd sensations. It was in vain I looked about\nme; in vain I saw the decent furniture and tall proportions of my room\nin the square; in vain that I recognised the pattern of the bed\ncurtains and the design of the mahogany frame; something still kept\ninsisting that I was not where I was, that I had not wakened where I\nseemed to be, but in the little room in Soho where I was accustomed to\nsleep in the body of Edward Hyde. I smiled to myself, and in my\npsychological way, began lazily to inquire into the elements of this\nillusion, occasionally, even as I did so, dropping back into a\ncomfortable morning doze. I was still so engaged when, in one of my\nmore wakeful moments, my eyes fell upon my hand. Now the hand of Henry\nJekyll (as you have often remarked) was professional in shape and size;\nit was large, firm, white and comely. But the hand which I now saw,\nclearly enough, in the yellow light of a mid-London morning, lying half\nshut on the bedclothes, was lean, corded, knuckly, of a dusky pallor\nand thickly shaded with a swart growth of hair. It was the hand of\nEdward Hyde.\n\nI must have stared upon it for near half a minute, sunk as I was in the\nmere stupidity of wonder, before terror woke up in my breast as sudden\nand startling as the crash of cymbals; and bounding from my bed I\nrushed to the mirror. At the sight that met my eyes, my blood was\nchanged into something exquisitely thin and icy. Yes, I had gone to bed\nHenry Jekyll, I had awakened Edward Hyde. How was this to be explained?\nI asked myself; and then, with another bound of terror\u2014how was it to be\nremedied? It was well on in the morning; the servants were up; all my\ndrugs were in the cabinet\u2014a long journey down two pairs of stairs,\nthrough the back passage, across the open court and through the\nanatomical theatre, from where I was then standing horror-struck. It\nmight indeed be possible to cover my face; but of what use was that,\nwhen I was unable to conceal the alteration in my stature? And then\nwith an overpowering sweetness of relief, it came back upon my mind\nthat the servants were already used to the coming and going of my\nsecond self. I had soon dressed, as well as I was able, in clothes of\nmy own size: had soon passed through the house, where Bradshaw stared\nand drew back at seeing Mr. Hyde at such an hour and in such a strange\narray; and ten minutes later, Dr. Jekyll had returned to his own shape\nand was sitting down, with a darkened brow, to make a feint of\nbreakfasting.\n\nSmall indeed was my appetite. This inexplicable incident, this reversal\nof my previous experience, seemed, like the Babylonian finger on the\nwall, to be spelling out the letters of my judgment; and I began to\nreflect more seriously than ever before on the issues and possibilities\nof my double existence. That part of me which I had the power of\nprojecting, had lately been much exercised and nourished; it had seemed\nto me of late as though the body of Edward Hyde had grown in stature,\nas though (when I wore that form) I were conscious of a more generous\ntide of blood; and I began to spy a danger that, if this were much\nprolonged, the balance of my nature might be permanently overthrown,\nthe power of voluntary change be forfeited, and the character of Edward\nHyde become irrevocably mine. The power of the drug had not been always\nequally displayed. Once, very early in my career, it had totally failed\nme; since then I had been obliged on more than one occasion to double,\nand once, with infinite risk of death, to treble the amount; and these\nrare uncertainties had cast hitherto the sole shadow on my contentment.\nNow, however, and in the light of that morning\u2019s accident, I was led to\nremark that whereas, in the beginning, the difficulty had been to throw\noff the body of Jekyll, it had of late gradually but decidedly\ntransferred itself to the other side. All things therefore seemed to\npoint to this; that I was slowly losing hold of my original and better\nself, and becoming slowly incorporated with my second and worse.\n\nBetween these two, I now felt I had to choose. My two natures had\nmemory in common, but all other faculties were most unequally shared\nbetween them. Jekyll (who was composite) now with the most sensitive\napprehensions, now with a greedy gusto, projected and shared in the\npleasures and adventures of Hyde; but Hyde was indifferent to Jekyll,\nor but remembered him as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in\nwhich he conceals himself from pursuit. Jekyll had more than a father\u2019s\ninterest; Hyde had more than a son\u2019s indifference. To cast in my lot\nwith Jekyll, was to die to those appetites which I had long secretly\nindulged and had of late begun to pamper. To cast it in with Hyde, was\nto die to a thousand interests and aspirations, and to become, at a\nblow and forever, despised and friendless. The bargain might appear\nunequal; but there was still another consideration in the scales; for\nwhile Jekyll would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence, Hyde\nwould be not even conscious of all that he had lost. Strange as my\ncircumstances were, the terms of this debate are as old and commonplace\nas man; much the same inducements and alarms cast the die for any\ntempted and trembling sinner; and it fell out with me, as it falls with\nso vast a majority of my fellows, that I chose the better part and was\nfound wanting in the strength to keep to it.\n\nYes, I preferred the elderly and discontented doctor, surrounded by\nfriends and cherishing honest hopes; and bade a resolute farewell to\nthe liberty, the comparative youth, the light step, leaping impulses\nand secret pleasures, that I had enjoyed in the disguise of Hyde. I\nmade this choice perhaps with some unconscious reservation, for I\nneither gave up the house in Soho, nor destroyed the clothes of Edward\nHyde, which still lay ready in my cabinet. For two months, however, I\nwas true to my determination; for two months, I led a life of such\nseverity as I had never before attained to, and enjoyed the\ncompensations of an approving conscience. But time began at last to\nobliterate the freshness of my alarm; the praises of conscience began\nto grow into a thing of course; I began to be tortured with throes and\nlongings, as of Hyde struggling after freedom; and at last, in an hour\nof moral weakness, I once again compounded and swallowed the\ntransforming draught.\n\nI do not suppose that, when a drunkard reasons with himself upon his\nvice, he is once out of five hundred times affected by the dangers that\nhe runs through his brutish, physical insensibility; neither had I,\nlong as I had considered my position, made enough allowance for the\ncomplete moral insensibility and insensate readiness to evil, which\nwere the leading characters of Edward Hyde. Yet it was by these that I\nwas punished. My devil had been long caged, he came out roaring. I was\nconscious, even when I took the draught, of a more unbridled, a more\nfurious propensity to ill. It must have been this, I suppose, that\nstirred in my soul that tempest of impatience with which I listened to\nthe civilities of my unhappy victim; I declare, at least, before God,\nno man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so\npitiful a provocation; and that I struck in no more reasonable spirit\nthan that in which a sick child may break a plaything. But I had\nvoluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts by which\neven the worst of us continues to walk with some degree of steadiness\namong temptations; and in my case, to be tempted, however slightly, was\nto fall.\n\nInstantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged. With a transport of\nglee, I mauled the unresisting body, tasting delight from every blow;\nand it was not till weariness had begun to succeed, that I was\nsuddenly, in the top fit of my delirium, struck through the heart by a\ncold thrill of terror. A mist dispersed; I saw my life to be forfeit;\nand fled from the scene of these excesses, at once glorying and\ntrembling, my lust of evil gratified and stimulated, my love of life\nscrewed to the topmost peg. I ran to the house in Soho, and (to make\nassurance doubly sure) destroyed my papers; thence I set out through\nthe lamplit streets, in the same divided ecstasy of mind, gloating on\nmy crime, light-headedly devising others in the future, and yet still\nhastening and still hearkening in my wake for the steps of the avenger.\nHyde had a song upon his lips as he compounded the draught, and as he\ndrank it, pledged the dead man. The pangs of transformation had not\ndone tearing him, before Henry Jekyll, with streaming tears of\ngratitude and remorse, had fallen upon his knees and lifted his clasped\nhands to God. The veil of self-indulgence was rent from head to foot. I\nsaw my life as a whole: I followed it up from the days of childhood,\nwhen I had walked with my father\u2019s hand, and through the self-denying\ntoils of my professional life, to arrive again and again, with the same\nsense of unreality, at the damned horrors of the evening. I could have\nscreamed aloud; I sought with tears and prayers to smother down the\ncrowd of hideous images and sounds with which my memory swarmed against\nme; and still, between the petitions, the ugly face of my iniquity\nstared into my soul. As the acuteness of this remorse began to die\naway, it was succeeded by a sense of joy. The problem of my conduct was\nsolved. Hyde was thenceforth impossible; whether I would or not, I was\nnow confined to the better part of my existence; and O, how I rejoiced\nto think of it! with what willing humility I embraced anew the\nrestrictions of natural life! with what sincere renunciation I locked\nthe door by which I had so often gone and come, and ground the key\nunder my heel!\n\nThe next day, came the news that the murder had not been overlooked,\nthat the guilt of Hyde was patent to the world, and that the victim was\na man high in public estimation. It was not only a crime, it had been a\ntragic folly. I think I was glad to know it; I think I was glad to have\nmy better impulses thus buttressed and guarded by the terrors of the\nscaffold. Jekyll was now my city of refuge; let but Hyde peep out an\ninstant, and the hands of all men would be raised to take and slay him.\n\nI resolved in my future conduct to redeem the past; and I can say with\nhonesty that my resolve was fruitful of some good. You know yourself\nhow earnestly, in the last months of the last year, I laboured to\nrelieve suffering; you know that much was done for others, and that the\ndays passed quietly, almost happily for myself. Nor can I truly say\nthat I wearied of this beneficent and innocent life; I think instead\nthat I daily enjoyed it more completely; but I was still cursed with my\nduality of purpose; and as the first edge of my penitence wore off, the\nlower side of me, so long indulged, so recently chained down, began to\ngrowl for licence. Not that I dreamed of resuscitating Hyde; the bare\nidea of that would startle me to frenzy: no, it was in my own person\nthat I was once more tempted to trifle with my conscience; and it was\nas an ordinary secret sinner that I at last fell before the assaults of\ntemptation.\n\nThere comes an end to all things; the most capacious measure is filled\nat last; and this brief condescension to my evil finally destroyed the\nbalance of my soul. And yet I was not alarmed; the fall seemed natural,\nlike a return to the old days before I had made my discovery. It was a\nfine, clear, January day, wet under foot where the frost had melted,\nbut cloudless overhead; and the Regent\u2019s Park was full of winter\nchirrupings and sweet with spring odours. I sat in the sun on a bench;\nthe animal within me licking the chops of memory; the spiritual side a\nlittle drowsed, promising subsequent penitence, but not yet moved to\nbegin. After all, I reflected, I was like my neighbours; and then I\nsmiled, comparing myself with other men, comparing my active good-will\nwith the lazy cruelty of their neglect. And at the very moment of that\nvainglorious thought, a qualm came over me, a horrid nausea and the\nmost deadly shuddering. These passed away, and left me faint; and then\nas in its turn faintness subsided, I began to be aware of a change in\nthe temper of my thoughts, a greater boldness, a contempt of danger, a\nsolution of the bonds of obligation. I looked down; my clothes hung\nformlessly on my shrunken limbs; the hand that lay on my knee was\ncorded and hairy. I was once more Edward Hyde. A moment before I had\nbeen safe of all men\u2019s respect, wealthy, beloved\u2014the cloth laying for\nme in the dining-room at home; and now I was the common quarry of\nmankind, hunted, houseless, a known murderer, thrall to the gallows.\n\nMy reason wavered, but it did not fail me utterly. I have more than\nonce observed that in my second character, my faculties seemed\nsharpened to a point and my spirits more tensely elastic; thus it came\nabout that, where Jekyll perhaps might have succumbed, Hyde rose to the\nimportance of the moment. My drugs were in one of the presses of my\ncabinet; how was I to reach them? That was the problem that (crushing\nmy temples in my hands) I set myself to solve. The laboratory door I\nhad closed. If I sought to enter by the house, my own servants would\nconsign me to the gallows. I saw I must employ another hand, and\nthought of Lanyon. How was he to be reached? how persuaded? Supposing\nthat I escaped capture in the streets, how was I to make my way into\nhis presence? and how should I, an unknown and displeasing visitor,\nprevail on the famous physician to rifle the study of his colleague,\nDr. Jekyll? Then I remembered that of my original character, one part\nremained to me: I could write my own hand; and once I had conceived\nthat kindling spark, the way that I must follow became lighted up from\nend to end.\n\nThereupon, I arranged my clothes as best I could, and summoning a\npassing hansom, drove to an hotel in Portland Street, the name of which\nI chanced to remember. At my appearance (which was indeed comical\nenough, however tragic a fate these garments covered) the driver could\nnot conceal his mirth. I gnashed my teeth upon him with a gust of\ndevilish fury; and the smile withered from his face\u2014happily for him\u2014yet\nmore happily for myself, for in another instant I had certainly dragged\nhim from his perch. At the inn, as I entered, I looked about me with so\nblack a countenance as made the attendants tremble; not a look did they\nexchange in my presence; but obsequiously took my orders, led me to a\nprivate room, and brought me wherewithal to write. Hyde in danger of\nhis life was a creature new to me; shaken with inordinate anger, strung\nto the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain. Yet the creature was\nastute; mastered his fury with a great effort of the will; composed his\ntwo important letters, one to Lanyon and one to Poole; and that he\nmight receive actual evidence of their being posted, sent them out with\ndirections that they should be registered. Thenceforward, he sat all\nday over the fire in the private room, gnawing his nails; there he\ndined, sitting alone with his fears, the waiter visibly quailing before\nhis eye; and thence, when the night was fully come, he set forth in the\ncorner of a closed cab, and was driven to and fro about the streets of\nthe city. He, I say\u2014I cannot say, I. That child of Hell had nothing\nhuman; nothing lived in him but fear and hatred. And when at last,\nthinking the driver had begun to grow suspicious, he discharged the cab\nand ventured on foot, attired in his misfitting clothes, an object\nmarked out for observation, into the midst of the nocturnal passengers,\nthese two base passions raged within him like a tempest. He walked\nfast, hunted by his fears, chattering to himself, skulking through the\nless frequented thoroughfares, counting the minutes that still divided\nhim from midnight. Once a woman spoke to him, offering, I think, a box\nof lights. He smote her in the face, and she fled.\n\nWhen I came to myself at Lanyon\u2019s, the horror of my old friend perhaps\naffected me somewhat: I do not know; it was at least but a drop in the\nsea to the abhorrence with which I looked back upon these hours. A\nchange had come over me. It was no longer the fear of the gallows, it\nwas the horror of being Hyde that racked me. I received Lanyon\u2019s\ncondemnation partly in a dream; it was partly in a dream that I came\nhome to my own house and got into bed. I slept after the prostration of\nthe day, with a stringent and profound slumber which not even the\nnightmares that wrung me could avail to break. I awoke in the morning\nshaken, weakened, but refreshed. I still hated and feared the thought\nof the brute that slept within me, and I had not of course forgotten\nthe appalling dangers of the day before; but I was once more at home,\nin my own house and close to my drugs; and gratitude for my escape\nshone so strong in my soul that it almost rivalled the brightness of\nhope.\n\nI was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfast, drinking the\nchill of the air with pleasure, when I was seized again with those\nindescribable sensations that heralded the change; and I had but the\ntime to gain the shelter of my cabinet, before I was once again raging\nand freezing with the passions of Hyde. It took on this occasion a\ndouble dose to recall me to myself; and alas! six hours after, as I sat\nlooking sadly in the fire, the pangs returned, and the drug had to be\nre-administered. In short, from that day forth it seemed only by a\ngreat effort as of gymnastics, and only under the immediate stimulation\nof the drug, that I was able to wear the countenance of Jekyll. At all\nhours of the day and night, I would be taken with the premonitory\nshudder; above all, if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair,\nit was always as Hyde that I awakened. Under the strain of this\ncontinually impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which I now\ncondemned myself, ay, even beyond what I had thought possible to man, I\nbecame, in my own person, a creature eaten up and emptied by fever,\nlanguidly weak both in body and mind, and solely occupied by one\nthought: the horror of my other self. But when I slept, or when the\nvirtue of the medicine wore off, I would leap almost without transition\n(for the pangs of transformation grew daily less marked) into the\npossession of a fancy brimming with images of terror, a soul boiling\nwith causeless hatreds, and a body that seemed not strong enough to\ncontain the raging energies of life. The powers of Hyde seemed to have\ngrown with the sickliness of Jekyll. And certainly the hate that now\ndivided them was equal on each side. With Jekyll, it was a thing of\nvital instinct. He had now seen the full deformity of that creature\nthat shared with him some of the phenomena of consciousness, and was\nco-heir with him to death: and beyond these links of community, which\nin themselves made the most poignant part of his distress, he thought\nof Hyde, for all his energy of life, as of something not only hellish\nbut inorganic. This was the shocking thing; that the slime of the pit\nseemed to utter cries and voices; that the amorphous dust gesticulated\nand sinned; that what was dead, and had no shape, should usurp the\noffices of life. And this again, that that insurgent horror was knit to\nhim closer than a wife, closer than an eye; lay caged in his flesh,\nwhere he heard it mutter and felt it struggle to be born; and at every\nhour of weakness, and in the confidence of slumber, prevailed against\nhim, and deposed him out of life. The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll was of\na different order. His terror of the gallows drove him continually to\ncommit temporary suicide, and return to his subordinate station of a\npart instead of a person; but he loathed the necessity, he loathed the\ndespondency into which Jekyll was now fallen, and he resented the\ndislike with which he was himself regarded. Hence the ape-like tricks\nthat he would play me, scrawling in my own hand blasphemies on the\npages of my books, burning the letters and destroying the portrait of\nmy father; and indeed, had it not been for his fear of death, he would\nlong ago have ruined himself in order to involve me in the ruin. But\nhis love of life is wonderful; I go further: I, who sicken and freeze at\nthe mere thought of him, when I recall the abjection and passion of\nthis attachment, and when I know how he fears my power to cut him off\nby suicide, I find it in my heart to pity him.\n\nIt is useless, and the time awfully fails me, to prolong this\ndescription; no one has ever suffered such torments, let that suffice;\nand yet even to these, habit brought\u2014no, not alleviation\u2014but a certain\ncallousness of soul, a certain acquiescence of despair; and my\npunishment might have gone on for years, but for the last calamity\nwhich has now fallen, and which has finally severed me from my own face\nand nature. My provision of the salt, which had never been renewed\nsince the date of the first experiment, began to run low. I sent out\nfor a fresh supply and mixed the draught; the ebullition followed, and\nthe first change of colour, not the second; I drank it and it was\nwithout efficiency. You will learn from Poole how I have had London\nransacked; it was in vain; and I am now persuaded that my first supply\nwas impure, and that it was that unknown impurity which lent efficacy\nto the draught.\n\nAbout a week has passed, and I am now finishing this statement under\nthe influence of the last of the old powders. This, then, is the last\ntime, short of a miracle, that Henry Jekyll can think his own thoughts\nor see his own face (now how sadly altered!) in the glass. Nor must I\ndelay too long to bring my writing to an end; for if my narrative has\nhitherto escaped destruction, it has been by a combination of great\nprudence and great good luck. Should the throes of change take me in\nthe act of writing it, Hyde will tear it in pieces; but if some time\nshall have elapsed after I have laid it by, his wonderful selfishness\nand circumscription to the moment will probably save it once again from\nthe action of his ape-like spite. And indeed the doom that is closing\non us both has already changed and crushed him. Half an hour from now,\nwhen I shall again and forever reindue that hated personality, I know\nhow I shall sit shuddering and weeping in my chair, or continue, with\nthe most strained and fearstruck ecstasy of listening, to pace up and\ndown this room (my last earthly refuge) and give ear to every sound of\nmenace. Will Hyde die upon the scaffold? or will he find courage to\nrelease himself at the last moment? God knows; I am careless; this is\nmy true hour of death, and what is to follow concerns another than\nmyself. Here then, as I lay down the pen and proceed to seal up my\nconfession, I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end.\n\n\n\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE STRANGE CASE OF DR.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\n\nSection 3.

The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S.

For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.",
